TI  - Differential responses to lithium in hyperexcitable neurons from patients with
      bipolar disorder.
LID - 10.1038/nature15526 [doi]
AB  - Bipolar disorder is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder that is characterized by 
      intermittent episodes of mania and depression; without treatment, 15% of patients
      commit suicide. Hence, it has been ranked by the World Health Organization as a
      top disorder of morbidity and lost productivity. Previous neuropathological
      studies have revealed a series of alterations in the brains of patients with
      bipolar disorder or animal models, such as reduced glial cell number in the
      prefrontal cortex of patients, upregulated activities of the protein kinase A and
      C pathways and changes in neurotransmission. However, the roles and causation of 
      these changes in bipolar disorder have been too complex to exactly determine the 
      pathology of the disease. Furthermore, although some patients show remarkable
      improvement with lithium treatment for yet unknown reasons, others are refractory
      to lithium treatment. Therefore, developing an accurate and powerful biological
      model for bipolar disorder has been a challenge. The introduction of induced
      pluripotent stem-cell (iPSC) technology has provided a new approach. Here we have
      developed an iPSC model for human bipolar disorder and investigated the cellular 
      phenotypes of hippocampal dentate gyrus-like neurons derived from iPSCs of
      patients with bipolar disorder. Guided by RNA sequencing expression profiling, we
      have detected mitochondrial abnormalities in young neurons from patients with
      bipolar disorder by using mitochondrial assays; in addition, using both
      patch-clamp recording and somatic Ca2+ imaging, we have observed hyperactive
      action-potential firing. This hyperexcitability phenotype of young neurons in
      bipolar disorder was selectively reversed by lithium treatment only in neurons
      derived from patients who also responded to lithium treatment. Therefore,
      hyperexcitability is one early endophenotype of bipolar disorder, and our model
      of iPSCs in this disease might be useful in developing new therapies and drugs
      aimed at its clinical treatment.

AB  - The growth of functional MRI has led to development of human brain atlases
      derived by parcellating resting-state connectivity patterns into functionally
      independent regions of interest (ROIs). All functional atlases to date have been 
      derived from resting-state fMRI data. But given that functional connectivity
      between regions varies with task, we hypothesized that an atlas incorporating
      both resting-state and task-based fMRI data would produce an atlas with finer
      characterization of task-relevant regions than an atlas derived from
      resting-state alone. To test this hypothesis, we derived parcellation atlases
      from twenty-nine healthy adult participants enrolled in the Cognitive Connectome 
      project, an initiative to improve functional MRI's translation into clinical
      decision-making by mapping normative variance in brain-behavior relationships.
      Participants underwent resting-state and task-based fMRI spanning nine cognitive 
      domains: motor, visuospatial, attention, language, memory, affective processing, 
      decision-making, working memory, and executive function. Spatially constrained
      n-cut parcellation derived brain atlases using (1) all participants' functional
      data (Task) or (2) a single resting-state scan (Rest). An atlas was also derived 
      from random parcellation for comparison purposes (Random). Two methods were
      compared: (1) a parcellation applied to the group's mean edge weights (mean), and
      (2) a two-stage approach with parcellation of individual edge weights followed by
      parcellation of mean binarized edges (two-stage). The resulting Task and Rest
      atlases had significantly greater similarity with each other (mean Jaccard
      indices JI= 0.72-0.85) than with the Random atlases (JI=0.59-0.63; all p<0.001
      after Bonferroni correction). Task and Rest atlas similarity was greatest for the
      two-stage method (JI=0.85), which has been shown as more robust than the mean
      method; these atlases also better reproduced voxelwise seed maps of the left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during rest and performing the n-back working
      memory task (r=0.75-0.80) than the Random atlases (r=0.64-0.72), further
      validating their utility. We expected regions governing higher-order cognition
      (such as frontal and anterior temporal lobes) to show greatest difference between
      Task and Rest atlases; contrary to expectations, these areas had greatest
      similarity between atlases. Our findings indicate that atlases derived from
      parcellation of task-based and resting-state fMRI data are highly comparable, and
      existing resting-state atlases are suitable for task-based analyses. We introduce
      an anatomically labeled fMRI-derived whole-brain human atlas for future Cognitive
      Connectome analyses.

AB  - Schizophrenia is characterized by substantial dysfunctions of reward processing, 
      leading to detrimental consequences for decision-making. The neurotransmitter
      dopamine is responsible for the transmission of reward signals and also known to 
      be involved in the mechanism of psychosis. Using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI), sixteen medicated patients with schizophrenia and sixteen healthy
      controls performed the 'desire-reason dilemma' (DRD) paradigm. This paradigm
      allowed us to directly investigate reward-related brain activations depending on 
      the interaction of bottom-up and top-down mechanisms, when a previously
      conditioned reward stimulus had to be rejected to achieve a superordinate
      long-term goal. Both patients and controls showed significant activations in the 
      mesolimbic reward system. In patients with schizophrenia, however, we found a
      significant hyperactivation of the left ventral striatum (vStr) when they were
      allowed to accept the conditioned reward stimuli, and a reduced top-down
      regulation of activation in the ventral striatum (vStr) and ventral tegmental
      area (VTA) while having to reject the immediate reward to pursue the
      superordinate task-goal. Moreover, while healthy subjects exhibited a negative
      functional coupling of the vStr with both the anteroventral prefrontal cortex
      (avPFC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) in the dilemma situation, 
      this functional coupling was significantly impaired in the patient group. These
      findings provide evidence for an increased ventral striatal activation to reward 
      stimuli and an impaired top-down control of reward signals by prefrontal brain
      regions in schizophrenia.

TI  - Increased fractional anisotropy in cerebellum in obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous morphology and diffusion-imaging studies have suggested that
      structural changes in white matter is an important part of the pathophysiology of
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, different methodological approaches
      and the heterogeneity of patient samples question the validity of the findings.
      Materials and methods In total, 30 patients were matched for age and sex with 30 
      healthy controls. All participants underwent T1-weighted magnetic resonance
      imaging, diffusion tensor imaging and T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery.
      Voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics were used to compare
      white matter volumes and diffusion tensor imaging between groups. These data were
      analysed correcting for the effects of multiple comparisons, age, sex, severity
      and duration of illness as nuisance covariates. White matter hyperintensities
      were manually identified. RESULTS: Increase in fractional anisotropy in
      cerebellum was the most prominent result. A decrease in fractional anisotrophy in
      patients comparable with previous studies was located in forceps minor. There
      were no differences in the white matter morphology or in the white matter
      hyperintensities between patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Decrease in
      fractional anisotrophy in forceps minor and increase in cerebellum were found,
      and they were not due to neither white matter hyperintensities nor morphology of 
      the white matter. Cerebellar hyperconnectivity could be an important part of OCD 
      pathophysiology.

AB  - Dopamine is implicated in a diverse range of cognitive functions including
      cognitive flexibility, task switching, signalling novel or unexpected stimuli as 
      well as advance information. There is also longstanding line of thought that
      links dopamine with belief formation and, crucially, aberrant belief formation in
      psychosis. Integrating these strands of evidence would suggest that dopamine
      plays a central role in belief updating and more specifically in encoding of
      meaningful information content in observations. The precise nature of this
      relationship has remained unclear. To directly address this question we developed
      a paradigm that allowed us to decompose two distinct types of information
      content, information-theoretic surprise that reflects the unexpectedness of an
      observation, and epistemic value that induces shifts in beliefs or, more
      formally, Bayesian surprise. Using functional magnetic-resonance imaging in
      humans we show that dopamine-rich midbrain regions encode shifts in beliefs
      whereas surprise is encoded in prefrontal regions, including the
      pre-supplementary motor area and dorsal cingulate cortex. By linking putative
      dopaminergic activity to belief updating these data provide a link to false
      belief formation that characterises hyperdopaminergic states associated with
      idiopathic and drug induced psychosis.

TI  - Atypical Neural Activity in Males But Not Females with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
AB  - The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the right temporo-parietal junction
      (rTPj) are highly involved in social understanding, a core area of impairment in 
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We used fMRI to investigate sex differences in
      the neural correlates of social understanding in 27 high-functioning adults with 
      ASD and 23 matched controls. There were no differences in neural activity in the 
      mPFC or rTPj between groups during social processing. Whole brain analysis
      revealed decreased activity in the posterior superior temporal sulcus in males
      with ASD compared to control males while processing social information. This
      pattern was not observed in the female sub-sample. The current study indicates
      that sex mediates the neurobiology of ASD, particularly with respect to
      processing social information.

AB  - Emotional and cognitive dysregulation in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been
      consistently considered to be attributed to structural and functional
      abnormalities in affective network (AN) and cognitive control network (CCN). This
      study was to investigate the functional connectivity (FC) patterns and altered
      functional interactions between both networks in MDD. We investigated
      resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging in the AN and
      the CCN in 25 MDD and 35 healthy controls (HC). The seeds were from voxel-based
      morphometry (VBM) analysis results. Then FC within the AN was assessed from a
      seed placed in the left amygdala (AMG) and FC within CCN was determined by
      placing seeds in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Compared with 
      HC, MDD showed reduced FC between left AMG and bilateral precuneus and right
      anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) within AN and reduced FC between right DLPFC and
      left cuneus, left lingual gyrus, and right ACC within CCN. An interaction hub of 
      altered FC in MDD between AN and CCN located in the right ACC. Interestingly, the
      altered FC between right ACC and left AMG was negatively correlated with
      depressive symptom score while the altered FC between right ACC and DLPFC was
      positively correlated the executive function in MDD. The right ACC not only
      supports the cognitive and emotional processes, but also is an altered functional
      interaction hub between AN and CCN in MDD. It further suggest multiple sources of
      dysregulation in AN and CCN implicate both top-down cognitive control and
      bottom-up emotional expression dysfunction in MDD.

TI  - Neurosurgery for schizophrenia: an update on pathophysiology and a novel
      therapeutic target.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - The main objectives of this review were to provide an update on the progress made
      in understanding specific circuit abnormalities leading to psychotic symptoms in 
      schizophrenia and to propose rational targets for therapeutic deep brain
      stimulation (DBS). Refractory schizophrenia remains a major unsolved clinical
      problem, with 10%-30% of patients not responding to standard treatment options.
      Progress made over the last decade was analyzed through reviewing structural and 
      functional neuroimaging studies in humans, along with studies of animal models of
      schizophrenia. The authors reviewed theories implicating dysfunction in
      dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling in the pathophysiology of the disorder, 
      paying particular attention to neurosurgically relevant nodes in the circuit. In 
      this context, the authors focused on an important pathological circuit involving 
      the associative striatum, anterior hippocampus, and ventral striatum, and discuss
      the possibility of targeting these nodes for therapeutic neuromodulation with
      DBS. Finally, the authors examined ethical considerations in the treatment of
      these vulnerable patients. The functional anatomy of neural circuits relevant to 
      schizophrenia remains of great interest to neurosurgeons and psychiatrists and
      lends itself to the development of specific targets for neuromodulation. Ongoing 
      progress in the understanding of these structures will be critical to the
      development of potential neurosurgical treatments of schizophrenia.

TI  - Functional Imaging Changes in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex in Adult ADHD.
LID - 1087054715611492 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Functional imaging studies have found reduced frontal activity, mainly
      in dorso/ventro-lateral regions and reduced task-related de-activation of the
      default mode network in childhood ADHD. Adult studies are fewer and inconclusive.
      We aimed to investigate the potential neural bases of executive function in ADHD 
      adults, examining brain activity during N-back task performance, and to explore
      the potential corrective effects of long-term methylphenidate treatment. METHOD: 
      We recruited a large adult ADHD-combined sample and a matched control group and
      obtained functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) images during task. ADHD
      participants were subdivided in a group under long-term treatment with
      methylphenidate (washed out for the scan) and a treatment-naive group. RESULTS:
      ADHD participants showed deficient de-activation of the medial prefrontal cortex 
      during 2-back task, implying default mode network dysfunction. We found no
      relationship between blunted de-activation and treatment history. CONCLUSION: As 
      de-activation failure in the medial frontal cortex is linked to lapses of
      attention, findings suggest a potential link to ADHD symptomatology.

TI  - Age-dependent and independent changes in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD) during spatial working memory performance.
PG  - 1-28
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has been associated
      with spatial working memory as well as frontostriatal core deficits. However, it 
      is still unclear how the link between these frontostriatal deficits and working
      memory function in ADHD differs in children and adults. This study examined
      spatial working memory in adults and children with ADHD, focusing on identifying 
      regions demonstrating age-invariant or age-dependent abnormalities. METHODS: We
      used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine a group of 26 children and 
      35 adults to study load manipulated spatial working memory in patients and
      controls. RESULTS: In comparison to healthy controls, patients demonstrated
      reduced positive parietal and frontostriatal load effects, i.e., less increase in
      brain activity from low to high load, despite similar task performance. In
      addition, younger patients showed negative load effects, i.e., a decrease in
      brain activity from low to high load, in medial prefrontal regions. Load effect
      differences between ADHD and controls that differed between age groups were found
      predominantly in prefrontal regions. Age-invariant load effect differences
      occurred predominantly in frontostriatal regions. CONCLUSIONS: The age-dependent 
      deviations support the role of prefrontal maturation and compensation in ADHD,
      while the age-invariant alterations observed in frontostriatal regions provide
      further evidence that these regions reflect a core pathophysiology in ADHD.

TI  - The modulation effect of longitudinal acupuncture on resting state functional
      connectivity in knee osteoarthritis patients.
PG  - 67
LID - 10.1186/s12990-015-0071-9 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in brain imaging have contributed to our understanding of the
      neural activity associated with acupuncture treatment. In this study, we
      investigated functional connectivity across longitudinal acupuncture treatments
      in older patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Over a period of 4 weeks (six
      treatments), we collected resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) scans from 30 patients before and after their first, third and sixth
      treatments. Clinical outcome showed a significantly greater pain subscore on the 
      Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (indicative of improvement)
      with verum acupuncture than with sham acupuncture. Independent component analysis
      (ICA) of the resting state fMRI data showed that the right frontoparietal network
      (rFPN) and the executive control network (ECN) showed enhanced functional
      connectivity (FC) with the rostral anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal
      cortex, a key region in the descending pain modulatory system, in the verum
      groups as compared to the sham group after treatments. We also found that the
      rFPN connectivity with the left insula is (1) significantly associated with
      changes in KOOS pain score after treatments, and (2) significantly enhanced after
      verum acupuncture treatments as compared to sham treatment. Analysis of the
      acupuncture needle stimulation scan showed that compared with sham treatment,
      verum acupuncture activated the left operculum/insula, which also overlaps with
      findings observed in resting state analysis. Our results suggest that acupuncture
      may achieve its therapeutic effect on knee OA pain by modulating functional
      connectivity between the rFPN, ECN and the descending pain modulatory pathway.

TI  - Social Function and Frontopolar Activation during a Cognitive Task in Patients
      with Bipolar Disorder.
PG  - 81-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is important to understand the neural basis of functional
      impairments in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) in order to be able to address
      the recovery. Recently, neurocognitive impairment emerged as a predictor of
      psychosocial function. A number of functional brain imaging studies have shown
      that social function is associated with activation of the prefrontal cortex
      during a cognitive task in healthy adults, and in patients with major depressive 
      disorder and schizophrenia. However, few studies have been conducted in patients 
      with BD. METHODS: We performed multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
      imaging to investigate the activation of the prefrontal cortex during a verbal
      fluency task (VFT). We also used the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale
      (SASS) to assess social functioning in patients with BD. Thirty-three depressed
      patients with BD and 65 age-, gender- and task performance-matched healthy
      controls (HCs) participated in this study. RESULTS: Depressed patients with BD
      showed reduced activation in the broader bilateral prefrontal cortex during the
      VFT compared to HCs. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was observed
      between the total SASS scores and right prefrontal activation in patients with
      BD. In the SASS subscores, the interest and motivation factor was also positively
      correlated with frontopolar activation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an
      association between social function and prefrontal activation in depressed
      patients with BD. The present study provides evidence that NIRS imaging could be 
      helpful in understanding the neural basis of social function.

TI  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Normalizes Functional Connectivity for Social Threat
      in Psychosis.
LID - sbv153 [pii]
AB  - Psychosis is often characterized by paranoia and poor social functioning.
      Neurally, there is evidence of functional dysconnectivity including abnormalities
      when processing facial affect. We sought to establish whether these abnormalities
      are resolved by cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp). The study
      involved 38 outpatients with one or more persistent positive psychotic symptoms, 
      and 20 healthy participants. All participants completed an implicit facial affect
      processing task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
      Subsequently, patients either continued to receive standard care only (SCO, n =
      16) or received CBTp on top of standard care (+CBTp, n = 22), with fMRI repeated 
      6-8 months later. To examine the mechanisms underlying CBTp-led changes in threat
      processing and appraisal, functional connectivity during the social threat (angry
      faces) condition was assessed separately from left amygdala and right
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) seeds. At baseline, patients, compared
      with healthy participants, showed greater amygdala connectivity with the insula
      and visual areas, but less connectivity with somatosensory areas. These
      differences normalized following CBTp and, compared with the SCO group, the +CBTp
      group showed greater increases in amygdala connectivity with DLPFC and inferior
      parietal lobule, with the latter correlating with improvement in positive
      symptoms. From the DLPFC seed, the +CBTp (compared with SCO) group showed
      significantly greater increase in DLPFC connectivity with other prefrontal
      regions including dorsal anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
      These findings indicate that CBTp strengthens connectivity between higher-order
      cognitive systems and those involved in threat and salience, potentially
      facilitating reappraisal.

TI  - Neural signatures of experimentally induced flow experiences identified in a
      typical fMRI block design with BOLD imaging.
LID - nsv133 [pii]
AB  - Previously, experimentally induced flow experiences have been demonstrated with
      perfusion imaging during activation blocks of three minutes length to accommodate
      with the putatively slowly evolving "mood" characteristics of flow (Ulrich et
      al., 2014). Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a
      sample of 23 healthy, male participants to investigate flow in the context of a
      typical fMRI block design with block lengths as short as 30 s. To induce flow,
      demands of arithmetic tasks were automatically and continuously adjusted to the
      individual skill level. Compared against conditions of boredom and overload,
      experience of flow was evident from individuals' reported subjective experiences 
      and changes in electrodermal activity. Neural activation was relatively increased
      during flow, particularly in the anterior insula, inferior frontal gyri, basal
      ganglia, and midbrain. Relative activation decreases during flow were observed in
      medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex, and in the medial temporal lobe
      including the amygdala. Present findings suggest that even in the context of
      comparably short activation blocks flow can be reliably experienced and is
      associated with changes in neural activation of brain regions previously
      described. Possible mechanisms of interacting brain regions are outlined awaiting
      further investigation which should now be possible given the greater temporal
      resolution compared to previous perfusion imaging.

TI  - Incoordination among subcellular compartments is associated to depression-like
      behavior induced by chronic mild stress.
LID - pyv122 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyv122 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is characterized as persistent low mood.
      Chronic stressful life in genetic susceptible individuals is presumably major
      etiology that leads to dysfunctions of monoamine and
      hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. These pathogenic factors cause neuron
      atrophy in the limbic system for major depressive disorder. Cell-specific
      pathophysiology is unclear, to which we investigate prelimbic cortical GABAergic 
      neurons and their interaction with glutamatergic neurons in depression-like mice.
      METHODS: The mice were treated by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in
      three weeks until they expressed depression-like behaviors confirmed by sucrose
      preference, Y-maze and forced swimming tests. The structures and functions of
      GABAergic and glutamatergic units in prelimbic cortices were studied by cell
      imaging and electrophysiology in CUMS-induced depression mice versus controls.
      RESULTS: In depression-like mice, prelimbic cortical GABAergic neurons show
      incoordination among the subcellular compartments, such as the decreased
      excitability and synaptic outputs as well as the increased reception from
      excitatory inputs. GABAergic synapses on glutamatergic cells demonstrate the
      decreased presynaptic innervation and the increased postsynaptic responsiveness. 
      CONCLUSIONS: CUMS-induced incoordination in prelimbic cortical GABAergic and
      glutamatergic neurons dysregulates their target neurons, which may be
      pathological basis for depressive mood. The rebalance of compatibility among
      subcellular compartments would be ideal strategy to treat neural disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying impairments in
      generalizing learning shown by adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
      METHOD: A total of 21 high-functioning individuals with ASD aged 12 to 18 years, 
      and 23 gender-, IQ-, and age-matched adolescents with typical development (TYP), 
      completed a transitive inference (TI) task implemented using rapid event-related 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were trained on
      overlapping pairs in a stimulus hierarchy of colored ovals where A>B>C>D>E>F and 
      then tested on generalizing this training to new stimulus pairings (AF, BD, BE)
      in a "Big Game." Whole-brain univariate, region of interest, and functional
      connectivity analyses were used. RESULTS: During training, the TYP group
      exhibited increased recruitment of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas the group
      with ASD showed greater functional connectivity between the PFC and the anterior 
      cingulate cortex (ACC). Both groups recruited the hippocampus and caudate
      comparably; however, functional connectivity between these regions was positively
      associated with TI performance for only the group with ASD. During the Big Game, 
      the TYP group showed greater recruitment of the PFC, parietal cortex, and the
      ACC. Recruitment of these regions increased with age in the group with ASD.
      CONCLUSION: During TI, TYP individuals recruited cognitive control-related brain 
      regions implicated in mature problem solving/reasoning including the PFC,
      parietal cortex, and ACC, whereas the group with ASD showed functional
      connectivity of the hippocampus and the caudate that was associated with task
      performance. Failure to reliably engage cognitive control-related brain regions
      may produce less integrated flexible learning in individuals with ASD unless they
      are provided with task support that, in essence, provides them with cognitive
      control; however, this pattern may normalize with age.

TI  - Structural covariance of neostriatal and limbic regions in patients with
      obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 150012
LID - 10.1503/jpn.150012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frontostriatal and frontoamygdalar connectivity alterations in
      patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have been typically described
      in functional neuroimaging studies. However, structural covariance, or volumetric
      correlations across distant brain regions, also provides network-level
      information. Altered structural covariance has been described in patients with
      different psychiatric disorders, including OCD, but to our knowledge, alterations
      within frontostriatal and frontoamygdalar circuits have not been explored.
      METHODS: We performed a mega-analysis pooling structural MRI scans from the
      Obsessive-compulsive Brain Imaging Consortium and assessed whole-brain voxel-wise
      structural covariance of 4 striatal regions (dorsal and ventral caudate nucleus, 
      and dorsal-caudal and ventral-rostral putamen) and 2 amygdalar nuclei
      (basolateral and centromedial-superficial). Images were preprocessed with the
      standard pipeline of voxel-based morphometry studies using Statistical Parametric
      Mapping software. RESULTS: Our analyses involved 329 patients with OCD and 316
      healthy controls. Patients showed increased structural covariance between the
      left ventral-rostral putamen and the left inferior frontal gyrus/frontal
      operculum region. This finding had a significant interaction with age; the
      association held only in the subgroup of older participants. Patients with OCD
      also showed increased structural covariance between the right
      centromedial-superficial amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
      LIMITATIONS: This was a cross-sectional study. Because this is a multisite data
      set analysis, participant recruitment and image acquisition were performed in
      different centres. Most patients were taking medication, and treatment protocols 
      differed across centres. CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence for structural 
      network-level alterations in patients with OCD involving 2 frontosubcortical
      circuits of relevance for the disorder and indicate that structural covariance
      contributes to fully characterizing brain alterations in patients with
      psychiatric disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cue-induced craving plays an important role in relapse, and the
      neural correlates of cue-induced craving have been elucidated using fMRI. This
      study examined the utility of real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback to strengthen
      self-regulation of craving-related neural activation and cue-reactivity in
      cigarette smokers. METHODS: Nicotine-dependent smokers were randomized to rtfMRI 
      neurofeedback or to a no-feedback control group. Participants completed 3
      neuroimaging visits. Within each visit, an initial run during which
      smoking-related cues were used to provoke craving, an individualized
      craving-related region of interest (ROI) in the prefrontal cortex or anterior
      cingulate cortex was identified. In the rtfMRI group, activity from the ROI was
      fed back via a visual display during 3 subsequent runs while participants were
      instructed to reduce craving during cue exposure. The control group had an
      identical experience with no feedback provided. RESULTS: Forty-four
      nicotine-dependent smokers were recruited to participate in our study; data from 
      the 33 participants who completed a 1-week follow-up visit were included in the
      analysis. Subjective craving ratings and cue-induced brain activation were lower 
      in the rtfMRI group than in the control group. LIMITATIONS: As participants were 
      not seeking treatment, clinical outcomes are lacking. CONCLUSION:
      Nicotine-dependent smokers receiving rtfMRI feedback from an individualized ROI
      attenuated smoking cue-elicited neural activation and craving, relative to a
      control group. Further studies are needed in treatment-seeking smokers to
      determine if this intervention can translate into a clinically meaningful
      treatment modality.

AB  - We use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to discriminate the alert
      and drowsy states for a passive brain-computer interface (BCI). The passive brain
      signals for the drowsy state are acquired from the prefrontal and dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex. The experiment is performed on 13 healthy subjects using a
      driving simulator, and their brain activity is recorded using a continuous-wave
      fNIRS system. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is employed for training and
      testing, using the data from the prefrontal, left- and right-dorsolateral
      prefrontal regions. For classification, eight features are tested: mean
      oxyhemoglobin, mean deoxyhemoglobin, skewness, kurtosis, signal slope, number of 
      peaks, sum of peaks, and signal peak, in 0~5, 0~10, and 0~15 second time windows,
      respectively. The results show that the best performance for classification is
      achieved using mean oxyhemoglobin, the signal peak, and the sum of peaks as
      features. The average accuracies in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (83.1, 83.4 and 84.9% in the 0~5, 0~10 and 0~15 second time windows,
      respectively) show that the proposed method has an effective utility for
      detection of drowsiness for a passive BCI.

TI  - Variation of the default mode network with altered alertness levels induced by
      propofol.
PG  - 2573-81
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S88156 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The default mode network (DMN) is closely associated with the
      maintenance of alertness and cognitive functions. This study aimed to observe the
      changes in DMN induced by increasing doses of propofol and progressively
      deepening sedation. METHODS: Twelve healthy subjects were selected; they received
      target-controlled infusion of propofol (1.0 and 3.0 mug/mL of plasma) and
      underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging before sedation and when they
      achieved light and deep sedation states. The average degree, average shortest
      path length, global efficiency, local efficiency, and clustering coefficient of
      DMN were assessed to study the overall and internal changes of DMN with gradual
      changes in alertness level, as well as the relationship between thalamus and DMN.
      Meanwhile, basic vital signs and respiratory inhibition were recorded. RESULTS:
      DMN parameters were gradually inhibited with decreasing level of alertness, the
      differences were significant between light sedation and awake states (all
      P<0.01), but not between deep and light sedation states. However, the shortest
      path lengths of the posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and
      lateral parietal cortexes in the DMN were significantly increased under deep
      sedation. CONCLUSION: Overall, DMN is propofol-sensitive. A small dose of
      propofol can significantly inhibit the DMN, affecting the level of alertness. The
      posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and lateral parietal
      cortexes in the DMN are less sensitive to propofol, and could be significantly
      inhibited by a higher concentration of propofol, further reducing the level of
      alertness.

TI  - Fair play: social norm compliance failures in behavioural variant frontotemporal 
      dementia.
LID - awv315 [pii]
AB  - Adherence to social norms is compromised in a variety of neuropsychiatric
      conditions. Functional neuroimaging studies have investigated social norm
      compliance in healthy individuals, leading to the identification of a network of 
      fronto-subcortical regions that underpins this ability. However, there is a lack 
      of corroborative evidence from human lesion models investigating the structural
      anatomy of norm compliance across this fronto-subcortical network. To address
      this, we developed a neuroeconomic task to investigate social norm compliance in 
      a neurodegenerative lesion model: behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, a 
      condition characterized by gross social dysfunction. The task assessed norm
      compliance across three behaviours that are well-studied in the neuroeconomics
      literature: fairness, prosocial and punishing behaviours. We administered our
      novel version of the Ultimatum Game in 22 patients with behavioural variant
      frontotemporal dementia and 22 age-matched controls, to assess how
      decision-making behaviour was modulated in response to (i) fairness of monetary
      offers; and (ii) social context of monetary offers designed to produce either
      prosocial or punishing behaviours. Voxel-based morphometry was used to
      characterize patterns of grey matter atrophy associated with task performance.
      Acceptance rates between patients and controls were equivalent when only fairness
      was manipulated. However, patients were impaired in modulating their decisions in
      response to social contextual information. Patients' performance in the
      punishment condition was consistent with a reduced tendency to engage in
      punishment; this was associated with decreased grey matter volume in the anterior
      cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right
      inferior frontal gyrus. In the prosocial condition, patients' performance
      suggested a reduced expression of prosocial behaviour, associated with decreased 
      grey matter in the anterior insula, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, anterior
      cingulate and dorsal striatum. Acceptance rates in the Ultimatum Game were also
      significantly related to impairments in the everyday expression of empathic
      concern. In conclusion, we demonstrate that compliance to basic social norms
      (fairness) can be maintained in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia;
      however, more complex normative behaviours (prosociality, punishment) that
      require integration of social contextual information are disrupted in association
      with atrophy in key fronto-striatal regions. These results suggest that the
      integration of social contextual information to guide normative behaviour is
      uniquely impaired in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, and may explain
      other common features of the condition including gullibility and impaired
      empathy. Our findings also converge with previous functional neuroimaging
      investigations in healthy individuals and provide the first description of the
      structural anatomy of social norm compliance in a neurodegenerative lesion model.

TI  - Spectral fitting using basis set modified by measured B field distribution.
LID - 10.1002/nbm.3430 [doi]
AB  - This study sought to demonstrate and evaluate a novel spectral fitting method to 
      improve quantification accuracy in the presence of large magnetic field
      distortion, especially with high fields. MRS experiments were performed using a
      point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS)-type sequence at 7 T. A double-echo gradient 
      echo (GRE) sequence was used to acquire B0 maps following MRS experiments. The
      basis set was modified based on the measured B0 distribution within the MRS
      voxel. Quantification results were obtained after fitting the measured MRS data
      using the modified basis set. The proposed method was validated using numerical
      Monte Carlo simulations, phantom measurements, and comparison of occipital lobe
      MRS measurements under homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetic field conditions.
      In vivo results acquired from voxels placed in thalamus and prefrontal cortex
      regions close to the frontal sinus agreed well with published values. Instead of 
      noise-amplifying complex division, the proposed method treats field variations as
      part of the signal model, thereby avoiding inherent statistical bias associated
      with regularization. Simulations and experiments showed that the proposed
      approach reliably quantified results in the presence of relatively large magnetic
      field distortion. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and is

TI  - Fronto-cerebellar dysfunction and dysconnectivity underlying cognition in
      friedreich ataxia: The IMAGE-FRDA study.
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23034 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder defined by
      pathology within the cerebellum and spinal tracts. Although FRDA is most readily 
      linked to motor and sensory dysfunctions, reported impairments in working memory 
      and executive functions indicate that abnormalities may also extend to
      associations regions of the cerebral cortex and/or cerebello-cerebral
      interactions. To test this hypothesis, 29 individuals with genetically confirmed 
      FRDA and 34 healthy controls performed a verbal n-back working memory task while 
      undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. No significant group
      differences were evident in task performance. However, individuals with FRDA had 
      deficits in brain activations both in the lateral cerebellar hemispheres,
      principally encompassing lobule VI, and the prefrontal cortex, including regions 
      of the anterior insular and rostrolateral prefrontal cortices. Functional
      connectivity between these brain regions was also impaired, supporting a putative
      link between primary cerebellar dysfunction and subsequent cerebral
      abnormalities. Disease severity and genetic markers of disease liability were
      correlated specifically with cerebellar dysfunction, while correlations between
      behavioural performance and both cerebral activations and cerebello-cerebral
      connectivity were observed in controls, but not in the FRDA cohort. Taken
      together, these findings support a diaschisis model of brain dysfunction, whereby
      primary disease effects in the cerebellum result in functional changes in
      downstream fronto-cerebellar networks. These fronto-cerebellar disturbances
      provide a putative biological basis for the nonmotor symptoms observed in FRDA,
      and reflect the consequence of localized cerebellar pathology to distributed
      brain function underlying higher-order cognition. Hum Brain Mapp, 2015. (c) 2015

TI  - [Behavioral characteristics of nicotine seeking: a role of the
      nicotine-conditioned effects and other mechanisms].
PG  - 135-43
AB  - Nicotine dependence and its neural mechanisms have been well documented by
      pharmacological, behavioral and neuroscience studies. In this review, we
      introduce recent new findings in this theme, particularly on the role of nicotine
      -associated stimuli as non-pharmacological factors affecting
      maintaining/reinstating nicotine seeking. By using the techniques of drug
      self-administration and conditioned place preference, nicotine's specific
      property of forming seeking/taking behavior is well characterized, and the
      mechanisms of seeking/taking could be partly explained by discrete and/or
      contextual conditioned stimuli (dCS and cCS). After having the repeated Pavlovian
      conditioning in the training/conditioning sessions, CSs begin to play a key role 
      for eliciting nicotine seeking behavior, with the activation of mesolimbic
      dopaminergic systems. In our study, intracranial self- stimulation (ICSS) was
      used to assess the mesolimbic dopamine activity. The nicotine-associated cCS also
      activated this neural system, which resulted in decreasing the ICSS threshold
      approximately 20% in the testing session under the cCS presentation. This finding
      would support the evidence of CS-induced incentive motivation for nicotine.
      According to the incentive salience hypothesis, the mesolimbic dopamine reflects 
      the motivation elicited by incentives (CSs), and induces the drug seeking
      behavior, which is activated through amygdala--nucleus accumbens--medial
      prefrontal cortex circuit. Additionally, human brain imaging studies have
      revealed that tobacco- associated stimuli activate not only these regions, but
      also right temporo-parietal junction of human cortex, which is relevant to the
      visual attention. In summary, the above evidence shows that nicotine-conditioned 
      stimuli might have powerful incentive salience and regulate nicotine
      seeking/taking behavior in animals and humans, though stress and
      nicotine-withdrawal could also enhance nicotine taking in the same way as other
      dependence -producing mechanisms.

TI  - Adding Sarcosine to Antipsychotic Treatment in Patients with Stable Schizophrenia
      Changes the Concentrations of Neuronal and Glial Metabolites in the Left
      Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex.
PG  - 24475-89
LID - 10.3390/ijms161024475 [doi]
AB  - The glutamatergic system is a key point in pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
      Sarcosine (N-methylglycine) is an exogenous amino acid that acts as a glycine
      transporter inhibitor. It modulates glutamatergic transmission by increasing
      glycine concentration around NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors. In patients
      with schizophrenia, the function of the glutamatergic system in the prefrontal
      cortex is impaired, which may promote negative and cognitive symptoms. Proton
      nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy is a non-invasive imaging
      method enabling the evaluation of brain metabolite concentration, which can be
      applied to assess pharmacologically induced changes. The aim of the study was to 
      evaluate the influence of a six-month course of sarcosine therapy on the
      concentration of metabolites (NAA, N-acetylaspartate; Glx, complex of glutamate, 
      glutamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA); mI, myo-inositol; Cr, creatine;
      Cho, choline) in the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in patients
      with stable schizophrenia. Fifty patients with schizophrenia, treated with
      constant antipsychotics doses, in stable clinical condition were randomly
      assigned to administration of sarcosine (25 patients) or placebo (25 patients)
      for six months. Metabolite concentrations in DLPFC were assessed with 1.5 Tesla
      (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. Clinical symptoms were evaluated with the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The first spectroscopy revealed no differences
      in metabolite concentrations between groups. After six months, NAA/Cho, mI/Cr and
      mI/Cho ratios in the left DLPFC were significantly higher in the sarcosine than
      the placebo group. In the sarcosine group, NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, mI/Cr, mI/Cho ratios 
      also significantly increased compared to baseline values. In the placebo group,
      only the NAA/Cr ratio increased. The addition of sarcosine to antipsychotic
      therapy for six months increased markers of neurons viability (NAA) and
      neurogilal activity (mI) with simultaneous improvement of clinical symptoms.
      Sarcosine, two grams administered daily, seems to be an effective adjuvant in the
      pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia.

AB  - Managing affective, negative, and cognitive symptoms remains the most difficult
      therapeutic problem in stable phase of schizophrenia. Efforts include
      administration of antidepressants. Drugs effects on brain metabolic parameters
      can be evaluated by means of proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR)
      spectroscopy. We compared spectroscopic parameters in the left prefrontal cortex 
      (DLPFC), the left frontal white matter (WM) and the left hippocampus and assessed
      the relationship between treatment and the spectroscopic parameters in both
      groups. We recruited 25 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (DSM-IV-TR), with
      dominant negative symptoms and in stable clinical condition, who were treated
      with antipsychotic and antidepressive medication for minimum of three months. A
      group of 25 patients with schizophrenia, who were taking antipsychotic drugs but 
      not antidepressants, was matched. We compared metabolic parameters
      (N-acetylaspartate (NAA), myo-inositol (mI), glutamatergic parameters (Glx),
      choline (Cho), and creatine (Cr)) between the two groups. All patients were also 
      assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Calgary
      Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS). In patients receiving antidepressants 
      we observed significantly higher NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios within the DLPFC, as
      well as significantly higher mI/Cr within the frontal WM. Moreover, we noted
      significantly lower values of parameters associated with the glutamatergic
      transmission-Glx/Cr and Glx/Cho in the hippocampus. Doses of antipsychotic drugs 
      in the group treated with antidepressants were also significantly lower in the
      patients showing similar severity of psychopathology.

TI  - Eyeblink Conditioning and Novel Object Recognition in the Rabbit: Behavioral
      Paradigms for Assaying Psychiatric Diseases.
PG  - 142
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2015.00142 [doi]
AB  - Analysis of data collected from behavioral paradigms has provided important
      information for understanding the etiology and progression of diseases that
      involve neural regions mediating abnormal behavior. The trace eyeblink
      conditioning (EBC) paradigm is particularly suited to examine cerebro-cerebellar 
      interactions since the paradigm requires the cerebellum, forebrain, and awareness
      of the stimulus contingencies. Impairments in acquiring EBC have been noted in
      several neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease
      (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
      Although several species have been used to examine EBC, the rabbit is unique in
      its tolerance for restraint, which facilitates imaging, its relatively large
      skull that facilitates chronic neuronal recordings, a genetic sequence for
      amyloid that is identical to humans which makes it a valuable model to study AD, 
      and in contrast to rodents, it has a striatum that is differentiated into a
      caudate and a putamen that facilitates analysis of diseases involving the
      striatum. This review focuses on EBC during schizophrenia and AD since
      impairments in cerebro-cerebellar connections have been hypothesized to lead to a
      cognitive dysmetria. We also relate EBC to conditioned avoidance responses that
      are more often examined for effects of antipsychotic medications, and we propose 
      that an analysis of novel object recognition (NOR) may add to our understanding
      of how the underlying neural circuitry has changed during disease states. We
      propose that the EBC and NOR paradigms will help to determine which therapeutics 
      are effective for treating the cognitive aspects of schizophrenia and AD, and
      that neuroimaging may reveal biomarkers of the diseases and help to evaluate
      potential therapeutics. The rabbit, thus, provides an important translational
      system for studying neural mechanisms mediating maladaptive behaviors that
      underlie some psychiatric diseases, especially cognitive impairments associated
      with schizophrenia and AD, and object recognition provides a simple test of
      memory that can corroborate the results of EBC.

TI  - Neuroimaging studies of the striatum in cognition Part I: healthy individuals.
PG  - 140
LID - 10.3389/fnsys.2015.00140 [doi]
AB  - The striatum has traditionally mainly been associated with playing a key role in 
      the modulation of motor functions. Indeed, lesion studies in animals and studies 
      of some neurological conditions in humans have brought further evidence to this
      idea. However, better methods of investigation have raised concerns about this
      notion, and it was proposed that the striatum could also be involved in different
      types of functions including cognitive ones. Although the notion was originally a
      matter of debate, it is now well-accepted that the caudate nucleus contributes to
      cognition, while the putamen could be involved in motor functions, and to some
      extent in cognitive functions as well. With the arrival of modern neuroimaging
      techniques in the early 1990, knowledge supporting the cognitive aspect of the
      striatum has greatly increased, and a substantial number of scientific papers
      were published studying the role of the striatum in healthy individuals. For the 
      first time, it was possible to assess the contribution of specific areas of the
      brain during the execution of a cognitive task. Neuroanatomical studies have
      described functional loops involving the striatum and the prefrontal cortex
      suggesting a specific interaction between these two structures. This review
      examines the data up to date and provides strong evidence for a specific
      contribution of the fronto-striatal regions in different cognitive processes,
      such as set-shifting, self-initiated responses, rule learning,
      action-contingency, and planning. Finally, a new two-level functional model
      involving the prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum is proposed suggesting an
      essential role of the dorsal striatum in selecting between competing potential
      responses or actions, and in resolving a high level of ambiguity.

      vicarious reward.
LID - nsv134 [pii]
AB  - The vicarious reward we receive from watching likable others obtaining a positive
      outcome is a pervasive phenomenon, yet its neural correlates are poorly
      understood. Here we conducted a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging
      experiments to test the hypothesis that the brain areas responsible for action
      observation and reward processing work in a coordinated fashion during vicarious 
      reward. In the first experiment (manipulation phase), the participant was
      instructed to cheer for a particular player in a two-player competitive game
      (Rock-Paper-Scissors). This manipulation made participants feel more unity with
      that player and resulted in unity-related activation in the premotor area during 
      action observation. In the following main experiment, the participant witnessed
      the previously cheered-for or non-cheered-for player succeed in a new solitary
      game (a stopwatch game). The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was activated
      when the cheered-for player succeeded in the game, but not when the other player 
      did. Interestingly, this vmPFC activation was functionally connected with
      premotor activation only during the cheered-for player's success. These results
      suggest that vicarious reward is processed in the vmPFC-premotor network, which
      is activated specifically by the success of the other person with whom the
      individual feels unity and closeness.

TI  - Multivariate classification of smokers and nonsmokers using SVM-RFE on structural
      MRI images.
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22956 [doi]
AB  - Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies have revealed gray matter alterations in
      smokers, but this type of analysis has poor predictive value for individual
      cases, which limits its applicability in clinical diagnoses and treatment. A
      predictive model would essentially embody a complex biomarker that could be used 
      to evaluate treatment efficacy. In this study, we applied VBM along with a
      multivariate classification method consisting of a support vector machine with
      recursive feature elimination to discriminate smokers from nonsmokers using their
      structural MRI data. Mean gray matter volumes in 1,024 cerebral cortical regions 
      of interest created using a subparcellated version of the Automated Anatomical
      Labeling template were calculated from 60 smokers and 60 nonsmokers, and served
      as input features to the classification procedure. The classifier achieved the
      highest accuracy of 69.6% when taking the 139 highest ranked features via 10-fold
      cross-validation. Critically, these features were later validated on an
      independent testing set that consisted of 28 smokers and 28 nonsmokers, yielding 
      a 64.04% accuracy level (binomial P = 0.01). Following classification,
      exploratory post hoc regression analyses were performed, which revealed that gray
      matter volumes in the putamen, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, 
      caudate, thalamus, pre-/postcentral gyrus, precuneus, and the parahippocampal

      results not only indicate that smoking related gray matter alterations can
      provide predictive power for group membership, but also suggest that machine

AB  - The cytoarchitecture and cortical connections of the ventral motor region are
      investigated using Nissl, and NeuN staining methods and the fluorescent
      retrograde tract tracing technique in the rhesus monkey. On the basis of gradual 
      laminar differentiation, it is shown that the ventral motor region stems from the
      ventral proisocortical area (anterior insula and dorsal Sylvian opercular
      region). The cytoarchitecture of the ventral motor region is shown to progress in
      three lines, as we have recently shown for the dorsal motor region. Namely, root 
      (anterior insular and dorsal Sylvian opercular area ProM), belt (ventral premotor
      cortex) and core (precentral motor cortex) lines. This stepwise architectonic
      organization is supported by the overall patterns of corticocortical connections.
      Areas in each line are sequentially interconnected (intralineal connections) and 
      all lines are interconnected (interlinear connections). Moreover, root areas, as 
      well as some of the belt areas of the ventral and dorsal trend are
      interconnected. The ventral motor region is also connected with the ventral
      somatosensory areas in a topographic manner. The root and belt areas of ventral
      motor region are connected with paralimbic, multimodal and prefrontal (outer
      belt) areas. In contrast, the core area has a comparatively more restricted
      pattern of corticocortical connections. This architectonic and connectional
      organization is consistent in part, with the functional organization of the
      ventral motor region as reported in behavioral and neuroimaging studies which
      include the mediation of facial expression and emotion, communication, phonic
      articulation, and language in human.

TI  - Gray Matter Loss and Related Functional Connectivity Alterations in A Chinese
      Family With Benign Adult Familial Myoclonic Epilepsy.

LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000001767 [doi]
AB  - Benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy (BAFME) is a non-progressive monogenic
      epilepsy syndrome. So far, the structural and functional brain reorganizations in
      BAFME remain uncharacterized. This study aims to investigate gray matter atrophy 
      and related functional connectivity alterations in patients with BAFME using
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Eleven BAFME patients from a Chinese pedigree
      and 15 matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Optimized voxel-based
      morphometric and resting-state functional MRI approaches were performed to
      measure gray matter atrophy and related functional connectivity, respectively.
      The Trail-Making Test-part A and part B, Digit Symbol Test (DST), and Verbal
      Fluency Test (VFT) were carried out to evaluate attention and executive
      functions.The BAFME patients exhibited significant gray matter loss in the right 
      hippocampus, right temporal pole, left orbitofrontal cortex, and left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. With these regions selected as seeds, the
      voxel-wise functional connectivity analysis revealed that the right hippocampus
      showed significantly enhanced connectivity with the right inferior parietal
      lobule, bilateral middle cingulate cortex, left precuneus, and left precentral
      gyrus. Moreover, the BAFME patients showed significant lower scores in DST and
      VFT tests compared with the healthy controls. The gray matter densities of the
      right hippocampus, right temporal pole, and left orbitofrontal cortex were
      significantly positively correlated with the DST scores. In addition, the gray
      matter density of the right temporal pole was significantly positively correlated
      with the VFT scores, and the gray matter density of the right hippocampus was
      significantly negatively correlated with the duration of illness in the
      patients.The current study demonstrates gray matter loss and related functional
      connectivity alterations in the BAFME patients, perhaps underlying deficits in
      attention and executive functions in the BAFME.

TI  - Alterations in Anatomical Covariance in the Prematurely Born.
LID - bhv248 [pii]
AB  - Preterm (PT) birth results in long-term alterations in functional and structural 
      connectivity, but the related changes in anatomical covariance are just beginning
      to be explored. To test the hypothesis that PT birth alters patterns of
      anatomical covariance, we investigated brain volumes of 25 PTs and 22 terms at
      young adulthood using magnetic resonance imaging. Using regional volumetrics,
      seed-based analyses, and whole brain graphs, we show that PT birth is associated 
      with reduced volume in bilateral temporal and inferior frontal lobes, left
      caudate, left fusiform, and posterior cingulate for prematurely born subjects at 
      young adulthood. Seed-based analyses demonstrate altered patterns of anatomical
      covariance for PTs compared with terms. PTs exhibit reduced covariance with R
      Brodmann area (BA) 47, Broca's area, and L BA 21, Wernicke's area, and white
      matter volume in the left prefrontal lobe, but increased covariance with R BA 47 
      and left cerebellum. Graph theory analyses demonstrate that measures of network
      complexity are significantly less robust in PTs compared with term controls.
      Volumes in regions showing group differences are significantly correlated with
      phonological awareness, the fundamental basis for reading acquisition, for the
      PTs. These data suggest both long-lasting and clinically significant alterations 
      in the covariance in the PTs at young adulthood.

TI  - Eating Behavior Associated with Gray Matter Volume Alternations: A Voxel Based
      Morphometry Study.

LID - 10.1016/j.appet.2015.10.017 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about whether eating behavior is associated with alterations of
      brain structure or whether the possible alterations are related to body weight
      status. The current study employed structural imaging from an open MRI data set
      (http://fcon_1000. PROJECTS: nitrc.org/indi/pro/nki.html) to examine the
      relationship between eating behavior traits and brain structural changes. The
      eating behavior traits were measured by the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire
      Scale. The brain structural alterations were analyzed using the Voxel Based
      Morphometry (VBM) method, and a multiple linear regression model was constructed 
      to identify significant brain structural changes that related to eating behavior 
      factors. We found that cognitive restraint of eating was positively correlated
      with the gray matter volume (GMV) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
      and negatively correlated with the GMV in the putamen; disinhibition scores were 
      negatively associated with the GMV in the left middle frontal gyrus; hunger
      scores showed a positive correlation with the GMV in the hypothalamus and the
      visual memory areas and a negative association with the GMV in the inferior
      temporal gyrus and the bilateral middle frontal gyrus. These results indicated a 
      close connection between the eating behavior traits and structural changes in
      particular brain regions. Conjunction analysis was also performed to further
      explore the brain structural alterations that were commonly associated with
      eating behavior and weight status. The findings add to our understanding of the
      neural basis underlying eating behaviors, and the connection between these
      behaviors and body weight status.

TI  - Gestational age and gender influence on executive control and its related neural 
      structures in preterm-born children at 6 years of age.
PG  - 1-20
AB  - Within preterm-born children, being born male and at a lower gestational age (GA)
      have both been associated with a heightened risk for developmental difficulties. 
      However, in this population little is known about the combined effect and the
      influence of these risk factors on cortical structures and executive control. In 
      the present study, 58 preterm-born children (GA ranging from 24.0 to 35.1 weeks) 
      were administered the computerized Child Attention Network Task at 6 years of
      age. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed and analyzed using
      Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) in all children. At a behavioral level, boys born
      <28 weeks of GA had significantly less executive control than preterm-born girls 
      <28 weeks (p = .001) and preterm-born boys >/=28 (p = .003). The reduced
      executive control in preterm-born boys <28 weeks gestation was related to lower
      cortical densities in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The current study links the higher incidence of
      reduced executive control in preterm-born boys to a higher degree of prematurity 
      (low GA) and identifies brain structural abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex
      related to these deficits. The implications of these results are discussed.

TI  - Prefrontal Cortex Activation While Walking Under Dual-Task Conditions in Stroke: 
      A Multimodal Imaging Study.
LID - 1545968315613864 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Walking while performing another task (eg, talking) is challenging
      for many stroke survivors, yet its neural basis are not fully understood.
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate prefrontal cortex activation and its relationship to
      gait measures while walking under single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions 
      (ie, walking while simultaneously performing a cognitive task) in stroke
      survivors. METHODS: We acquired near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from the
      prefrontal cortex during treadmill walking in ST and DT conditions in chronic
      stroke survivors and healthy controls. We also acquired functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) and NIRS during simulated walking under these
      conditions. RESULTS: NIRS revealed increased oxygenated hemoglobin concentration 
      in DT-walking compared with ST-walking for both groups. For simulated walking,
      NIRS showed a significant effect of group and group x task, being greater on both
      occasions, in stroke survivors. A greater increase in brain activation observed
      from ST to DT walking/ simulated walking was related to a greater change in motor
      performance in stroke survivors. fMRI revealed increased activity during DT
      relative to ST conditions in stroke patients in areas including the inferior
      temporal gyri, superior frontal gyri and cingulate gyri bilaterally, and the
      right precentral gyrus. The DT-related increase in fMRI activity correlated with 
      DT-related change in behavior in stroke participants in the bilateral inferior
      temporal gyrus, left cingulate gyrus, and left frontal pole. CONCLUSION: Our
      results provide novel evidence that enhanced brain activity changes relate to
      dual task motor decrements.

AB  - Increasing efforts have been made to investigate the underlying pathophysiology
      of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but only limited consistent information is
      available on gray (GM) and white matter (WM) volume changes in affected adults.
      Additionally, few studies employed dimensional approaches to GAD pathology. This 
      study compares structural brain imaging data from n=19 GAD subjects and n=24
      healthy comparison (HC) subjects, all medication-free and matched on age, sex and
      education. Separate categorical and dimensional models were employed using
      voxel-based morphometry for GM and WM. Significantly higher GM volumes were found
      in GAD subjects mainly in basal ganglia structures and less consistently in the
      superior temporal pole. For WM, GAD subjects showed significantly lower volumes
      in the dlPFC. Largely consistent findings in dimensional and categorical models
      point toward these structural alterations being reliable and of importance for
      GAD. While lower volume in the dlPFC could reflect impaired emotional processing 
      and control over worry in GAD, basal ganglia alterations may be linked to
      disturbed gain and loss anticipation as implicated in previous functional GAD
      studies. As perturbations in anticipation processes are central to GAD, these
      areas may warrant greater attention in future studies.

TI  - Disrupted default mode network connectivity in male adolescents with conduct
      disorder.
AB  - Conduct disorder (CD) is a serious behavioral disorder of childhood and
      adolescence. The default mode network (DMN) is a brain network which supports
      self-referential cognitive processes and is typically deactivated during task
      performance. The aim of this study was to investigate DMN connectivity in male
      adolescents with pure CD compared to typically-developing controls. Eighteen male
      adolescents with CD and 18 sex-, age- and education-matched typically-developing 
      (TD) participants were recruited. Current and lifetime psychiatric disorders were
      assessed using the Chinese version of the Schedule for Affective Disorder and
      Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version. Resting state
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were obtained using a 3.0 T
      scanner. Independent components analysis (ICA) was used to investigate functional
      connectivity between the DMN and related brain regions. DMN activity was observed
      in medial prefrontal, posterior cingulate, and lateral parietal cortices, and
      extended to the brainstem. Adolescents with CD showed significantly reduced
      functional connectivity within the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC),
      bilateral precuneus and right superior temporal gyrus relative to TD controls. CD
      is associated with reduced functional connectivity within the DMN and between the
      DMN and other regions. These preliminary results suggest that deficits in DMN
      functional connectivity may serve as a biomarker of CD.

TI  - A systematic review of the neural bases of psychotherapy for anxiety and related 
      disorders.
PG  - 261-79
AB  - Brain imaging studies over two decades have delineated the neural circuitry of
      anxiety and related disorders, particularly regions involved in fear processing
      and in obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The neural circuitry of fear processing
      involves the amygdala, anterior cingulate, and insular cortex, while
      cortico-striatal-thalamic circuitry plays a key role in obsessive-compulsive
      disorder. More recently, neuroimaging studies have examined how psychotherapy for
      anxiety and related disorders impacts on these neural circuits. Here we conduct a
      systematic review of the findings of such work, which yielded 19 functional
      magnetic resonance imaging studies examining the neural bases of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in 509 patients with anxiety and related
      disorders. We conclude that, although each of these related disorders is mediated
      by somewhat different neural circuitry, CBT may act in a similar way to increase 
      prefrontal control of subcortical structures. These findings are consistent with 
      an emphasis in cognitive-affective neuroscience on the potential therapeutic
      value of enhancing emotional regulation in various psychiatric conditions.

TI  - Amplified Brain Processing of Dentoalveolar Pressure Stimulus in Persistent
      Dentoalveolar Pain Disorder Patients.
PG  - 349-62
LID - 10.11607/ofph.1463 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: (1) To determine the brain regions activated by dentoalveolar pressure
      stimulation in persistent dentoalveolar pain disorder (PDAP) patients, and (2) to
      compare these activation patterns to those seen in pain-free control subjects.
      METHODS: A total of 13 PDAP patients and 13 matched controls completed the study.
      Clinical pain characteristics and psychosocial data were collected. Dentoalveolar
      mechanical pain thresholds were determined with a custom-made device over the
      painful area for patients and were used as the stimulation level during
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquisition. Control subjects
      received two stimulation levels over matched locations during fMRI scanning: one 
      determined (as above) that evoked equally subjective pain ratings matching those 
      of patients (subjective-pain match) and another nonpainful stimulation level
      matching the average stimulus intensity provided to patients (stimulus-intensity 
      match). Clinical and psychosocial data were analyzed using independent samples t 
      tests, Mann-Whitney U test, and Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient. fMRI
      data were analyzed using validated neuroimaging software and tested using a
      general linear model. RESULTS: PDAP patients had greater anxiety (P < .0001) and 
      depression scores (P = .001), more jaw function impairment (P < .0001), and
      greater social impact (P < .0001) than controls. No significant differences were 
      found for brain activation spatial extent (PDAP X Controls subjective pain: P =
      .48; PDAP X Controls stimulus intensity: P = .12). Brain activations were
      significantly increased for PDAP patients compared to control subjects when
      matched to stimulus intensity in several regions related to the
      sensory-discriminative and cognitive components of pain perception, including the
      primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, inferior parietal lobule, insula,
      premotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, and thalamus. When matched to subjective pain
      ratings, increased brain activations were still present for PDAP patients
      compared to controls, although to a lesser extent. CONCLUSION: The present
      results suggest that dentoalveolar pressure is processed differently in the brain
      of PDAP patients, and the increased activation in several brain areas is
      consistent with amplified pain processing.

TI  - Reduced prefrontal activation during working and long-term memory tasks and
      impaired patient-reported cognition among cancer survivors postchemotherapy
      compared with healthy controls.
LID - 10.1002/cncr.29737 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy have reported cognitive
      impairments that may last for years after the completion of treatment. Working
      memory-related and long-term memory-related changes in this population are not
      well understood. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that
      cancer-related cognitive impairments are associated with the under recruitment of
      brain regions involved in working and recognition memory compared with controls. 
      METHODS: Oncology patients (n = 15) who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and 
      had evidence of cognitive impairment according to neuropsychological testing and 
      self-report and a group of age-matched, education group-matched, cognitively
      normal control participants (n = 14) underwent functional magnetic resonance
      imaging. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants performed a
      nonverbal n-back working memory task and a visual recognition task. RESULTS: On
      the working memory task, when 1-back and 2-back data were averaged and contrasted
      with 0-back data, significantly reduced activation was observed in the right
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for oncology patients versus controls. On the
      recognition task, oncology patients displayed decreased activity of the
      left-middle hippocampus compared with controls. Neuroimaging results were not
      associated with patient-reported cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased recruitment of
      brain regions associated with the encoding of working memory and recognition
      memory was observed in the oncology patients compared with the control group.
      These results suggest that there is a reduction in neural functioning
      postchemotherapy and corroborate patient-reported cognitive difficulties after
      cancer treatment, although a direct association was not observed. Cancer 2015.

PG  - 1491
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01491 [doi]
AB  - Gratitude is an important aspect of human sociality, and is valued by religions
      and moral philosophies. It has been established that gratitude leads to benefits 
      for both mental health and interpersonal relationships. It is thus important to
      elucidate the neurobiological correlates of gratitude, which are only now
      beginning to be investigated. To this end, we conducted an experiment during
      which we induced gratitude in participants while they underwent functional
      magnetic resonance imaging. We hypothesized that gratitude ratings would
      correlate with activity in brain regions associated with moral cognition, value
      judgment and theory of mind. The stimuli used to elicit gratitude were drawn from
      stories of survivors of the Holocaust, as many survivors report being sheltered
      by strangers or receiving lifesaving food and clothing, and having strong
      feelings of gratitude for such gifts. The participants were asked to place
      themselves in the context of the Holocaust and imagine what their own experience 
      would feel like if they received such gifts. For each gift, they rated how
      grateful they felt. The results revealed that ratings of gratitude correlated
      with brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal
      cortex, in support of our hypotheses. The results provide a window into the brain
      circuitry for moral cognition and positive emotion that accompanies the
      experience of benefitting from the goodwill of others.

AB  - Suicidal vulnerability has been related to impaired value-based decision-making
      and increased sensitivity to social threat, mediated by the prefrontal cortex.
      Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we aimed at replicating these
      previous findings by measuring brain activation during the Iowa Gambling Task and
      an emotional faces viewing task. Participants comprised 15 euthymic suicide
      attempters (history of depression and suicidal behavior) who were compared with
      23 euthymic patient controls (history of depression without suicidal history) and
      35 healthy controls. The following five model-based regions of interest were
      investigated: the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
      (VLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial (MPFC) and dorsal prefrontal
      cortex (DPFC). Suicide attempters relative to patient controls showed (1)
      increased response to angry vs. neutral faces in the left OFC and the VLPFC, as
      previously reported; (2) increased response to wins vs. losses in the right OFC, 
      DPFC and ACC; (3) decreased response to risky vs. safe choices in the left DPFC; 
      and (4) decreased response to sad vs. neutral faces in the right ACC. This study 
      links impaired valuation processing (here for signals of social threat, sadness
      and reward) to prefrontal cortex dysfunction in suicide attempters. These
      long-term deficits may underlie the impaired decision-making and social
      difficulties found in suicide attempters.

AB  - Down-regulation of the amygdala with real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI NF)
      potentially allows targeting brain circuits of emotion processing and may involve
      prefrontal-limbic networks underlying effective emotion regulation. Little
      research has been dedicated to the effect of rtfMRI NF on the functional
      connectivity of the amygdala and connectivity patterns in amygdala
      down-regulation with neurofeedback have not been addressed yet. Using
      psychophysiological interaction analysis of fMRI data, we present evidence that
      voluntary amygdala down-regulation by rtfMRI NF while viewing aversive pictures
      was associated with increased connectivity of the right amygdala with the
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in healthy subjects (N=16). In contrast, a
      control group (N=16) receiving sham feedback did not alter amygdala connectivity 
      (GroupxCondition t-contrast: p<.05 at cluster-level). Task-dependent increases in
      amygdala-vmPFC connectivity were predicted by picture arousal (beta=.59, p<.05). 
      A dynamic causal modeling analysis with Bayesian model selection aimed at further
      characterizing the underlying causal structure and favored a bottom-up model
      assuming predominant information flow from the amygdala to the vmPFC (xp=.90).
      The results were complemented by the observation of task-dependent alterations in
      functional connectivity of the vmPFC with the visual cortex and the ventrolateral
      PFC in the experimental group (Condition t-contrast: p<.05 at cluster-level).
      Taken together, the results underscore the potential of amygdala fMRI
      neurofeedback to influence functional connectivity in key networks of emotion
      processing and regulation. This may be beneficial for patients suffering from
      severe emotion dysregulation by improving neural self-regulation.

AB  - Faking memory impairment means normal people complain lots of memory problems
      without organic damage in forensic assessments. Using alternative forced-choice
      paradigm, containing digital or autobiographical information, previous
      neuroimaging studies have indicated that faking memory impairment could cause the
      activation in the prefrontal and parietal regions, and might involve a
      fronto-parietal-subcortical circuit. However, it is still unclear whether
      different memory types have influence on faking or not. Since different memory
      types, such as long-term memory (LTM) and short-term memory (STM), were found
      supported by different brain areas, we hypothesized that feigned STM or LTM
      impairment had distinct neural activation mapping. Besides that, some common
      neural correlates may act as the general characteristic of feigned memory
      impairment. To verify this hypothesis, the functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) combined with an alternative word forced-choice paradigm were used in this
      study. A total of 10 right-handed participants, in this study, had to perform
      both STW and LTM tasks respectively under answering correctly, answering randomly
      and feigned memory impairment conditions. Our results indicated that the
      activation of the left superior frontal gyrus and the left medial frontal gyrus
      was associated with feigned LTM impairment, whereas the left superior frontal
      gyrus, the left precuneus and the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were
      highly activated while feigning STM impairment. Furthermore, an overlapping was
      found in the left superior frontal gyrus, and it suggested that the activity of
      the left superior frontal gyrus might be acting as a specific marker of feigned
      memory impairment.

AB  - Chronic back pain (CBP) is associated with circumscribed atrophy in gray matter
      (GM) predominantly localized in areas of the so called "pain matrix" and the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). Previous studies applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM) 
      for identifying structural brain alterations related to CBP have reported
      inconsistent results, are limited to small sample sizes and often did not control
      for medication. We therefore used VBM for high resolution magnetic resonance
      images to investigate the association of CBP and regional GM volume in 111
      individuals with CBP und 432 pain free controls derived from the representative
      Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP), while controlling for effects of medication.
      CBP was associated with decreased regional GM in the ventrolateral (VLPFC) and
      dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), both the ventral and dorsal medial PFC (mPFC) and the
      anterior insula. Pain intensity showed a weak negative correlated with GM volume 
      in the left DLPFC, VLPFC and ACC. The CBP sample showed alterations in regions
      commonly associated with pain processing and emotional demands. To our knowledge,
      this is the first VBM study reporting decreased regional GM volume in the mPFC in
      a CBP sample. However, we were unable to confirm alterations in regions other
      than the DLPFC and the insula. PERSPECTIVE: Previous studies reported
      inconsistent results for brain areas altered in chronic pain conditions that may 
      be in part attributable to small sample sizes, medication use or emotional
      comorbidities. This study in a large and representative cohort helps to clarify
      these issues.

AB  - Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) studies in schizophrenia patients
      generally report decreased levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), glutamate and
      glutathione, particularly in frontal cortex. However, these data are inconsistent
      in part due to confounds associated with clinical samples. The lack of validated 
      diagnostic biomarkers also hampers analysis of the neurodevelopmental trajectory 
      of neurochemical abnormalities. Rodent models are powerful tools to address these
      issues, particularly when combined with 1H MRS (clinically comparable
      technology). We investigated the trajectory of metabolic changes in the
      prefrontal cortex during brain maturation from adolescence to adulthood in vivo
      using 1H MRS in rats exposed prenatally to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (POL),
      a rodent model of maternal immune activation (MIA), an epidemiological risk
      factor for several psychiatric disorders with a neurodevelopmental origin.
      Longitudinal in vivo 1H MRS revealed a significant decrease in PFC levels of GSH 
      and taurine in adult, but not adolescent rats. Significant agexMIA interactions
      for PFC levels of NAA were also observed. These data replicate some deficits
      observed in the PFC of patients with schizophrenia. There were no significant
      changes in the levels of glutamate or any other metabolite. These data suggest
      prenatal exposure to POL leads to subtle metabolic perturbations of the normal
      maturing PFC, which may be related to subsequent behavioural abnormalities.
      Further work is however required to examine any potential confound of shipping
      stress on the presumed imbalances in PFC metabolites in POL-exposed offspring.
      Testing the interactions between MIA with stress or genetic risk variants will
      also be an important advance.

AB  - Inter-subject variability in age-related brain changes may relate to educational 
      attainment, as suggested by cognitive reserve theories. This voxel-based
      morphometry study investigated the impact of very low educational level on the
      relationship between regional gray matter (rGM) volumes and age in healthy
      elders. Magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired in elders with low
      educational attainment (less than 4 years) (n = 122) and high educational level
      (n = 66), pulling together individuals examined using either of three MRI
      scanners/acquisition protocols. Voxelwise group comparisons showed no rGM
      differences (p<0.05, family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons). When 
      within-group voxelwise patterns of linear correlation were compared between high 
      and low education groups, there was one cluster of greater rGM loss with aging in
      low versus high education elders in the left anterior cingulate cortex (p<0.05,
      FWE-corrected), as well as a trend in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
      (p<0.10). These results provide preliminary indication that education might exert
      subtle protective effects against age-related brain changes in healthy subjects. 
      The anterior cingulate cortex, critical to inhibitory control processes, may be
      particularly sensitive to such effects, possibly given its involvement in
      cognitive stimulating activities at school or later throughout life.

TI  - A nap to recap or how reward regulates hippocampal-prefrontal memory networks
      during daytime sleep in humans.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.07903 [doi]
AB  - Sleep plays a crucial role in the consolidation of newly acquired memories. Yet, 
      how our brain selects the noteworthy information that will be consolidated during
      sleep remains largely unknown. Here we show that post-learning sleep favors the
      selectivity of long-term consolidation: when tested three months after initial
      encoding, the most important (i.e., rewarded, strongly encoded) memories are
      better retained, and also remembered with higher subjective confidence. Our brain
      imaging data reveals that the functional interplay between dopaminergic reward
      regions, the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus contributes to the integration
      of rewarded associative memories. We further show that sleep spindles strengthen 
      memory representations based on reward values, suggesting a privileged replay of 
      information yielding positive outcomes. These findings demonstrate that
      post-learning sleep determines the neural fate of motivationally-relevant
      memories and promotes a value-based stratification of long-term memory stores.

TI  - Clinical Response to tDCS Depends on Residual Brain Metabolism and Grey Matter
      Integrity in Patients With Minimally Conscious State.
LID - S1935-861X(15)01049-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.brs.2015.07.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was recently shown to 
      promote recovery of voluntary signs of consciousness in some patients in
      minimally conscious state (MCS). However, it remains unclear why clinical
      improvement is only observed in a subgroup of patients. OBJECTIVES: In this
      retrospective study, we investigated the relationship between tDCS responsiveness
      and neuroimaging data from MCS patients. METHODS: Structural Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI), Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and
      clinical electroencephalography (EEG) were acquired in 21 sub-acute and chronic
      MCS patients (8 tDCS responders) who subsequently (<48 h) received left
      dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPF) tDCS in a double-blind randomized cross-over
      trial. The behavioral data have been published elsewhere (Thibaut et al.,
      Neurology, 2014). RESULTS: Grey matter atrophy was observed in non-responders as 
      compared with responders in the left DLPF cortex, the medial-prefrontal cortex,
      the cingulate cortex, the hippocampi, part of the rolandic regions, and the left 
      thalamus. FDG-PET showed hypometabolism in non-responders as compared with
      responders in the left DLPF cortex, the medial-prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, 
      and the thalamus. EEG did not show any difference between the two groups.
      CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the transient increase of signs of
      consciousness following left DLPF tDCS in patients in MCS require grey matter
      preservation and residual metabolic activity in cortical and subcortical brain
      areas known to be involved in attention and working memory. These results further
      underline the critical role of long-range cortico-thalamic connections in
      consciousness recovery, providing important information for guidelines on the use
      of tDCS in disorders of consciousness.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0140731 [doi]
AB  - The present study is to investigate the brain activation associated with the
      informative value of negative feedback in rule acquisition. In each trial of a
      segmented Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, participants were provided with three
      reference cards and one target card, and were asked to match one of three
      reference cards to the target card based on a classification rule. Participants
      received feedback after each match. Participants would acquire the rule after one
      negative feedback (1-NF condition) or two successive negative feedbacks (2-NF
      condition). The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results indicated
      that lateral prefrontal-to-parietal cortices were more active in the 2-NF
      condition than in the 1-NF condition. The activation in the right lateral
      prefrontal cortex and left posterior parietal cortex increased gradually with the
      amount of negative feedback. These results demonstrate that the informative value
      of negative feedback in rule acquisition might be modulated by the lateral
      prefronto-parietal loop.

PG  - jn.00633.2015
LID - 10.1152/jn.00633.2015 [doi]
AB  - In non-human primates, the tactile representation at the cortical level has
      mostly been studied using single cell recordings targeted to specific cortical
      areas. In this study, we explored the representation of tactile information
      delivered to the face or the shoulders at the whole-brain level, using functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the non-human primate. We used air-puffs
      delivered either to the center of the face, the periphery of the face or the
      shoulders. These stimulations elicited activations in numerous cortical areas,
      encompassing the primary and secondary somatosensory areas, prefrontal and
      premotor areas, parietal, temporal and cingulate areas, as well as low-level
      visual cortex. Importantly, a specific parieto-temporo-prefrontal network
      responded to the three stimulations but presented a marked preference for
      air-puffs directed to the center of the face. This network corresponds to areas
      that are also involved in near space representation as well as in the
      multisensory integration of information at the interface between this near space 
      and the skin of the face, and is probably involved in the construction of a
      peripersonal space representation around the head.

TI  - Insight and psychosis: Functional and anatomical brain connectivity and
      self-reflection in Schizophrenia.
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22955 [doi]
AB  - Impaired insight into illness, associated with worse treatment outcome, is common
      in schizophrenia. Insight has been related to the self-reflective processing,
      centred on the medial frontal cortex. We hypothesized that anatomical and
      functional routes to and from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) would
      differ in patients according to their degree of impaired insight. Forty-five
      schizophrenia patients and 19 healthy subjects performed a self-reflection task
      during fMRI, and underwent diffusion tensor imaging. Using dynamic causal
      modelling we observed increased effective connectivity from the posterior
      cingulate cortex (PCC), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and dorsal mPFC (dmPFC)
      towards the vmPFC with poorer insight and decrease from vmPFC to the IPL.
      Stronger connectivity from the PCC to vmPFC during judgment of traits related to 
      self was associated with poorer insight. We found small-scale significant changes
      in white matter integrity associated with clinical insight. Self-reflection may
      be influenced by synaptic changes that lead to the observed alterations in
      functional connectivity accompanied by the small-scale but measurable alterations
      in anatomical connections. Our findings may point to a neural compensatory
      response to an impairment of connectivity between self-processing regions.
      Similarly, the observed hyper-connectivity might be a primary deficit linked to
      inefficiency in the component cognitive processes that lead to impaired insight. 
      We suggest that the stronger cognitive demands placed on patients with poor
      insight is reflected in increased effective connectivity during the task in this 
      study. Hum Brain Mapp, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - In Vivo Two-Photon Imaging of Dendritic Spines in Marmoset Neocortex(1,2,3).
LID - 10.1523/ENEURO.0019-15.2015 [doi]
LID - ENEURO.0019-15.2015 [pii]
AB  - Two-photon microscopy in combination with a technique involving the artificial
      expression of fluorescent protein has enabled the direct observation of dendritic
      spines in living brains. However, the application of this method to primate
      brains has been hindered by the lack of appropriate labeling techniques for
      visualizing dendritic spines. Here, we developed an adeno-associated virus
      vector-based fluorescent protein expression system for visualizing dendritic
      spines in vivo in the marmoset neocortex. For the clear visualization of each
      spine, the expression of reporter fluorescent protein should be both sparse and
      strong. To fulfill these requirements, we amplified fluorescent signals using the
      tetracycline transactivator (tTA)-tetracycline-responsive element system and by
      titrating down the amount of Thy1S promoter-driven tTA for sparse expression. By 
      this method, we were able to visualize dendritic spines in the marmoset cortex by
      two-photon microscopy in vivo and analyze the turnover of spines in the
      prefrontal cortex. Our results demonstrated that short spines in the marmoset
      cortex tend to change more frequently than long spines. The comparison of in vivo
      samples with fixed samples showed that we did not detect all existing spines by
      our method. Although we found glial cell proliferation, the damage of tissues
      caused by window construction was relatively small, judging from the comparison
      of spine length between samples with or without window construction. Our new
      labeling technique for two-photon imaging to visualize in vivo dendritic spines
      of the marmoset neocortex can be applicable to examining circuit reorganization
      and synaptic plasticity in primates.

AB  - Several reports have described cortical thickness (CTh) developmental
      trajectories, with conflicting results. Some studies have reported inverted-U
      shape curves with peaks of CTh in late childhood to adolescence, while others
      suggested predominant monotonic decline after age 6. In this study, we reviewed
      CTh developmental trajectories in the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development, 
      and in a second step, evaluated the impact of post-processing quality control
      (QC) procedures on identified trajectories. The quality-controlled sample
      included 384 individual subjects with repeated scanning (1-3 per subject, total
      scans n=753) from 4.9 to 22.3years of age. The best-fit model (cubic, quadratic, 
      or first-order linear) was identified at each vertex using mixed-effects models. 
      The majority of brain regions showed linear monotonic decline of CTh. There were 
      few areas of cubic trajectories, mostly in bilateral temporo-parietal areas and
      the right prefrontal cortex, in which CTh peaks were at, or prior to, age 8. When
      controlling for total brain volume, CTh trajectories were even more uniformly
      linear. The only sex difference was faster thinning of occipital areas in boys
      compared to girls. The best-fit model for whole brain mean thickness was a
      monotonic decline of 0.027mm per year. QC procedures had a significant impact on 
      identified trajectories, with a clear shift toward more complex trajectories
      (i.e., quadratic or cubic) when including all scans without QC (n=954).
      Trajectories were almost exclusively linear when using only scans that passed the
      most stringent QC (n=598). The impact of QC probably relates to decreasing the
      inclusion of scans with CTh underestimation secondary to movement artifacts,
      which are more common in younger subjects. In summary, our results suggest that
      CTh follows a simple linear decline in most cortical areas by age 5, and all
      areas by age 8. This study further supports the crucial importance of
      implementing post-processing QC in CTh studies of development, aging, and
      neuropsychiatric disorders.

TI  - How Administration of the Beta-Blocker Propranolol Prior to Extinction can
      Prevent the Return of Fear.
LID - 10.1038/npp.2015.315 [doi]
AB  - Combining beta-blockers with exposure-therapy has been advocated to reduce fear, 
      yet experimental studies combining beta-blockers with memory reactivation have
      had contradictory results. We explored how beta-blockade might affect the course 
      of safety learning and the subsequent return of fear in a double-blind
      placebo-controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging study in humans (N=46). 
      A single dose of propranolol prior to extinction learning caused a loss of
      conditioned fear responses, and prevented the subsequent return of fear and
      decreased explicit memory for the fearful events in the absence of drug.
      Fear-related neural responses were persistently attenuated in the dorsal medial
      prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), increased in the hippocampus 24 h later, and
      correlated with individual behavioral indices of fear. Prediction error-related
      responses in the ventral striatum persisted during beta-blockade. We suggest that
      this pattern of results is most consistent with a model where beta-blockade can
      prevent the return of fear by i) reducing retrieval of fear memory, via the dmPFC
      and ii) increasing contextual safety learning, via the hippocampus. Our findings 
      suggest that retrieval of fear memory and contextual safety learning form
      potential mnemonic target mechanisms to optimize exposure-based therapy with
      beta-blockers.Neuropsychopharmacology accepted article preview online, 14 October

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The rate of biological change in middle-adulthood is relatively
      under-studied. Here, we used behavioral testing in conjunction with structural
      magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effects of chronological age on
      associative learning proficiency and on brain regions that previous functional
      MRI studies have closely related to the domain of associative learning. METHODS: 
      Participants (n=66) completed a previously established associative learning
      paradigm, and consented to be scanned using structural magnetic resonance
      imaging. Age-related effects were investigated both across sub-groups in the
      sample (younger vs. older) and across the entire sample (using regression
      approaches). RESULTS: Chronological age had substantial effects on learning
      proficiency (independent of IQ and Education Level), with older adults showing a 
      decrement compared to younger adults. In addition, decreases in estimated gray
      matter volume were observed in multiple brain regions including the hippocampus
      and the dorsal prefrontal cortex, both of which are strongly implicated in
      associative learning. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that middle adulthood may
      be a more dynamic period of life-span change than previously believed. The
      conjunctive application of narrowly focused tasks, with conjointly acquired
      structural MRI data may allow us to enrich the search for, and the interpretation
      of, age-related changes in cross-sectional samples.

      high trait impulsivity.
PG  - e659
LID - 10.1038/tp.2015.139 [doi]
AB  - High impulsivity is an important risk factor for addiction with evidence from
      endophenotype studies. In addiction, behavioral control is shifted toward the
      habitual end. Habitual control can be described by retrospective updating of
      reward expectations in 'model-free' temporal-difference algorithms. Goal-directed
      control relies on the prospective consideration of actions and their outcomes,
      which can be captured by forward-planning 'model-based' algorithms. So far, no
      studies have examined behavioral and neural signatures of model-free and
      model-based control in healthy high-impulsive individuals. Fifty healthy
      participants were drawn from the upper and lower ends of 452 individuals,
      completing the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. All participants performed a
      sequential decision-making task during functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) and underwent structural MRI. Behavioral and fMRI data were analyzed by
      means of computational algorithms reflecting model-free and model-based control. 
      Both groups did not differ regarding the balance of model-free and model-based
      control, but high-impulsive individuals showed a subtle but significant
      accentuation of model-free control alone. Right lateral prefrontal model-based
      signatures were reduced in high-impulsive individuals. Effects of smoking,
      drinking, general cognition or gray matter density did not account for the
      findings. Irrespectively of impulsivity, gray matter density in the left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was positively associated with model-based
      control. The present study supports the idea that high levels of impulsivity are 
      accompanied by behavioral and neural signatures in favor of model-free behavioral
      control. Behavioral results in healthy high-impulsive individuals were
      qualitatively different to findings in patients with the same task. The
      predictive relevance of these results remains an important target for future
      longitudinal studies.

      evidence suggests that dysregulation of polySia-NCAM is involved in schizophrenia
      (SZ). We enrolled 45 patients diagnosed with SZ and 45 healthy individuals who
      were submitted to polySia-NCAM peripheral quantification, cognitive and
      psychopathological assessment and structural neuroimaging (brain volumes and
      diffusion tensor imaging). PolySia-NCAM serum levels were increased in SZ
      patients, independently of antipsychotic treatment, and were associated with
      negative symptoms, blunted affect and declarative memory impairment. The
      increased polySia-NCAM levels were associated with decreased volume in the left
      prefrontal cortex, namely Brodmann area 46, in patients and increased volume in
      the same brain area of healthy individuals. As this brain region is involved in
      the pathophysiology of SZ and its associated phenomenology, the data indicate
      that polySia-NCAM deserves further scrutiny because of its possible role in early
      neurodevelopmental mechanisms of the disorder.

TI  - Site and size of multiple sclerosis lesions predict enhanced or decreased female 
      orgasmic function.
AB  - Neuroimaging identified brain areas involved in female orgasm. In women with
      multiple sclerosis (MS), associations between orgasmic function and the site and 
      size of MS-related magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes are undetermined.
      This study intended to correlate MS-associated cerebral lesion load and location 
      with clinical scores of female orgasmic function. In 50 women with MS (mean age
      37.0 +/- 9.9 years), we assessed Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) scores for
      orgasmic frequency, difficulty and satisfaction. We determined disease duration, 
      Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, and cerebral MS-lesion load and
      location using T2-weighed 1.5 T MRIs. We correlated FSFI scores for orgasm with
      patient age, disease duration, EDSS scores, and cerebral MS-lesion load (Spearman
      rank correlation; significance: p < 0.05). FSFI scores for orgasm correlated
      inversely with MS-lesion load in the left temporal periventricular white matter
      and right middle-inferior occipital area, but directly with MS-lesion load in the
      right frontal primary motor cortex, left prefrontal/inferior frontal cortex,
      right amygdala, left temporal middle-inferior and fusiform areas, and midbrain.
      FSFI scores for orgasm did not correlate with patient age, disease duration and
      EDSS scores (p > 0.05). In conclusion, our results indicate that MS-lesions in
      left temporal periventricular and right visual association areas deteriorate
      orgasmic function. In contrast, direct correlations between frontotemporal or
      midbrain lesions and higher FSFI scores, indicating enhanced or disinhibited
      orgasmic function, suggest that these brain regions normally buffer orgasmic
      responses. Moreover, our results indicate that orgasmic dysfunction in women with
      MS evolves independently of disease duration and physical disability.

      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - A pilot study.

AB  - While antisaccade paradigms invoke circuitry associated with cognitive control
      and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), there is a dearth of
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations using antisaccade
      tasks among children with ADHD. Neural correlates associated with antisaccade
      performance were examined with fMRI in 11 children with ADHD (10 medicated)
      matched to 11 typically developing children. Significantly greater brain
      activation in regions in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus
      was observed in children with ADHD relative to the control group. This pattern
      separated the children into their respective groups in a taxonomic manner.
      Sensitivity analyses probing comorbidity and medication-specific effects showed
      that results were consistent; however, the caudate nucleus difference was only
      detectable in the full sample, or in subsets with a more relaxed cluster
      threshold. Antisaccade performance did not significantly differ between the
      groups, perhaps as a result of greater brain activation or medication effects in 
      the ADHD group. Thus, antisaccade paradigms may have sensitivity and specificity 
      for the investigation of cognitive control deficits and associated neural
      correlates in ADHD, and may contribute towards the development of new treatment
      approaches for children with the disorder.

AB  - Neuroimaging and brain damage studies suggest that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (dlPFC) is involved in the cognitive control of episodic recollection. If dlPFC
      is causally involved in retrieval, then transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) of this brain region should increase recollection accuracy, especially
      when recollection is difficult and requires cognitive control. Here, we report
      the first brain stimulation experiment to directly test this hypothesis. We
      administered tDCS to dlPFC immediately after studying to-be-learned material but 
      just prior to recollection testing, thereby targeting retrieval processes. We
      found that stimulation of dlPFC significantly increased recollection accuracy,
      relative to a no-stimulation sham condition and also relative to active
      stimulation of a comparison region in left parietal cortex. There was no
      significant difference in the size of this increase between hemispheres.
      Moreover, these dlPFC stimulation effects were behaviorally selective, increasing
      accuracy only when participants needed to recollect difficult information.
      Electrically stimulating dlPFC allowed people to more accurately recollect
      specific details of their experiences, demonstrating a causal role of dlPFC in
      the retrieval of episodic memories.

LID - 10.1016/j.jpain.2015.09.008 [doi]
AB  - In contrast to women with relatively asymptomatic endometriosis, women with
      endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain (CPP) exhibit non-pelvic
      hyperalgesia and decreased gray matter volume in key neural pain processing
      regions. While these findings suggest central pain amplification in
      endometriosis-associated CPP, the underlying changes in brain chemistry and
      function associated with central pain amplification remain unknown. We performed 
      proton spectroscopy and seed-based resting functional connectivity MRI to
      determine whether women with endometriosis display differences in insula
      excitatory neurotransmitter concentrations or intrinsic brain connectivity to
      other pain-related brain regions. Relative to age-matched pain-free controls,
      women with endometriosis-associated CPP displayed elevated levels of combined
      glutamine-glutamate (Glx) within the anterior insula, and greater anterior insula
      connectivity to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Increased connectivity
      between these regions was positively correlated with anterior insula Glx
      concentrations (r=0.87), as well as clinical anxiety (r=0.61,p=0.02), depression 
      (r=0.60,p=0.03), and pain intensity (r=0.55,p=0.05). There were no significant
      differences in insula metabolite levels or resting-state connectivity in
      endometriosis without CPP subjects versus controls. We conclude that enhanced
      anterior insula glutamatergic neurotransmission and connectivity with the mPFC,
      key regions of the salience and default mode networks, may play a role in the
      pathophysiology of CPP independent of the presence of endometriosis. PERSPECTIVE:
      Similar to other chronic pain conditions, endometriosis-associated pelvic pain is
      associated with altered brain chemistry and function in the pain matrix. These
      findings support central pain amplification as a mechanism of CPP, and clinicians
      should consider the use of adjunctive therapies that target central pain
      dysfunction in these women.

TI  - Early unilateral cochlear implantation promotes mature cortical asymmetries in
      adolescents who are deaf.
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23019 [doi]
AB  - Unilateral cochlear implant (CI) stimulation establishes hearing to children who 
      are deaf but compromises bilateral auditory development if a second implant is
      not provided within approximately 1.5 years. In this study we asked: 1) What are 
      the cortical consequences of missing this early sensitive period once children
      reach adolescence? 2) What are the effects of unilateral deprivation on the
      pathways from the opposite ear? Cortical responses were recorded from 64-cephalic
      electrodes within the first week of bilateral CI activation in 34 adolescents who
      had over 10 years of unilateral right CI experience and in 16 normal hearing
      peers. Cortical activation underlying the evoked peaks was localized to areas of 
      the brain using beamformer imaging. The first CI evoked activity which was more
      strongly lateralized to the contralateral left hemisphere than normal, with
      abnormal recruitment of the left prefrontal cortex (involved in
      cognition/attention), left temporo-parietal-occipital junction (multi-modal
      integration), and right precuneus (visual processing) region. CI stimulation in
      the opposite deprived ear evoked atypical cortical responses with abnormally
      large and widespread dipole activity across the cortex. Thus, using a unilateral 
      CI to hear beyond the period of cortical maturation causes lasting asymmetries in
      the auditory system, requires recruitment of additional cortical areas to support
      hearing, and does little to protect the unstimulated pathways from effects of
      auditory deprivation. The persistence of this reorganization into maturity could 
      signal a closing of a sensitive period for promoting auditory development on the 
      deprived side. Hum Brain Mapp, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Changes in working memory are sensitive indicators of both normal and
      pathological brain aging and associated disability. The present study aims to
      further understanding of working memory in normal aging using a large cohort of
      healthy elderly in order to examine three separate phases of information
      processing in relation to changes in task load activation. Using covariance
      analysis, increasing and decreasing neural activation was observed on fMRI in
      response to a delayed item recognition task in 337 cognitively healthy elderly
      persons as part of the CRESCENDO (Cognitive REServe and Clinical ENDOphenotypes) 
      study. During three phases of the task (stimulation, retention, probe), increased
      activation was observed with increasing task load in bilateral regions of the
      prefrontal cortex, parietal lobule, cingulate gyrus, insula and in deep gray
      matter nuclei, suggesting an involvement of central executive and salience
      networks. Decreased activation associated with increasing task load was observed 
      during the stimulation phase, in bilateral temporal cortex, parietal lobule,
      cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex. This spatial distribution of decreased
      activation is suggestive of the default mode network. These findings support the 
      hypothesis of an increased activation in salience and central executive networks 
      and a decreased activation in default mode network concomitant to increasing task
      load.

TI  - Varieties of semantic 'access' deficit in Wernicke's aphasia and semantic
      aphasia.
LID - awv281 [pii]
AB  - Comprehension deficits are common in stroke aphasia, including in cases with (i) 
      semantic aphasia, characterized by poor executive control of semantic processing 
      across verbal and non-verbal modalities; and (ii) Wernicke's aphasia, associated 
      with poor auditory-verbal comprehension and repetition, plus fluent speech with
      jargon. However, the varieties of these comprehension problems, and their
      underlying causes, are not well understood. Both patient groups exhibit some type
      of semantic 'access' deficit, as opposed to the 'storage' deficits observed in
      semantic dementia. Nevertheless, existing descriptions suggest that these
      patients might have different varieties of 'access' impairment-related to
      difficulty resolving competition (in semantic aphasia) versus initial activation 
      of concepts from sensory inputs (in Wernicke's aphasia). We used a case series
      design to compare patients with Wernicke's aphasia and those with semantic
      aphasia on Warrington's paradigmatic assessment of semantic 'access' deficits. In
      these verbal and non-verbal matching tasks, a small set of semantically-related
      items are repeatedly presented over several cycles so that the target on one
      trial becomes a distractor on another (building up interference and eliciting
      semantic 'blocking' effects). Patients with Wernicke's aphasia and semantic
      aphasia were distinguished according to lesion location in the temporal cortex,
      but in each group, some individuals had additional prefrontal damage. Both of
      these aspects of lesion variability-one that mapped onto classical 'syndromes'
      and one that did not-predicted aspects of the semantic 'access' deficit. Both
      semantic aphasia and Wernicke's aphasia cases showed multimodal semantic
      impairment, although as expected, the Wernicke's aphasia group showed greater
      deficits on auditory-verbal than picture judgements. Distribution of damage in
      the temporal lobe was crucial for predicting the initially 'beneficial' effects
      of stimulus repetition: cases with Wernicke's aphasia showed initial improvement 
      with repetition of words and pictures, while in semantic aphasia, semantic access
      was initially good but declined in the face of competition from previous targets.
      Prefrontal damage predicted the 'harmful' effects of repetition: the ability to
      reselect both word and picture targets in the face of mounting competition was
      linked to left prefrontal damage in both groups. Therefore, patients with
      semantic aphasia and Wernicke's aphasia have partially distinct impairment of
      semantic 'access' but, across these syndromes, prefrontal lesions produce
      declining comprehension with repetition in both verbal and non-verbal tasks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Late adolescents are under increased risk of developing depressive
      symptoms. Behavioral activation is an effective treatment for subthreshold
      depression, which can prevent the development of subthreshold depression into a
      major depressive disorder. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the efficacy
      of behavioral activation have not been clearly understood. We investigated neural
      responses during reward processing by individuals with subthreshold depression to
      clarify the neural mechanisms of behavioral activation. METHODS: Late adolescent 
      university students with subthreshold depression (n=15, age 18-19 years) as
      indicated by a high score on the Beck's Depression Inventory-ll (BDI-ll) and 15
      age-matched controls with a low BDI-ll score participated in functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging scanning conducted during a monetary incentive delay task on
      two occasions. The Individuals in the subthreshold depression group received
      five, weekly behavioral activation sessions between the two scanning sessions.
      Moreover, they did not receive any medication until the study was completed.
      RESULTS: Behavioral activation significantly reduced depressive symptoms.
      Moreover, compared to the changes in brain functions in the control group, the
      behavioral activation group showed functional changes during loss anticipation in
      brain structures that mediates cognitive and emotional regulation, including the 
      left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus. LIMITATIONS: Replication 
      of the study with a larger sample size is required to increase the
      generalizability of these results. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral activation results in 
      improved functioning of the fronto-parietal region during loss anticipation.
      These results increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying specific
      psychotherapies.

TI  - Individual differences in depression are associated with abnormal function of the
      limbic system in multiple sclerosis patients.
LID - 1352458515606987 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS),
      although the brain mechanisms of this psychiatric condition in MS are poorly
      understood. Specifically, it remains to be determined whether depression in MS is
      related to altered activity and functional connectivity patterns within limbic
      circuits. METHODS: Seventy-seven MS patients with variable levels of depression
      (as assessed via the Beck Depression Inventory) underwent functional magnetic
      resonance imaging while performing an emotional processing task. To conduct the
      functional connectivity analyses, the bilateral amygdala and hippocampus, two
      areas critically involved in the pathophysiology of depression, were chosen as
      'seed' regions. Multiple regression models were used to assess how depression in 
      MS patients was correlated with the activity and functional connectivity patterns
      within the limbic system. RESULTS: Depression scores in MS patients were
      negatively correlated: (1) with the activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex;
      (2) with the functional connectivity between the hippocampus and orbitofrontal
      cortex as well as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and (3) with the functional
      connectivity between the amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that individual differences in depression in MS
      patients were significantly associated with altered regional activity and
      functional connectivity patterns within the limbic system.

TI  - [Neural Mechanisms Underlying the Performance Limitations in Dual-Task
      Situations].
PG  - 1215-29
LID - 10.11477/mf.1416200286 [doi]
AB  - Simultaneous performance of two tasks often results in degradation of performance
      in either or both tasks. This effect is known as dual-task interference and
      thought to be caused by the capacity limitation of cognitive resources used for
      cognitive processes. There have been several questions regarding dual-tasking in 
      cognitive neuroscience: which brain area specifically participates in dual-task
      processing, what are cognitive resources, where are the cognitive resources
      located in the brain, what neural mechanism limits the capacity of cognitive
      resources, and whether cognitive resources are modality-specific or
      modality-general. Although human neuroimaging studies revealed that the
      prefrontal cortex plays an essential role in the dual-task performance, these
      studies could not determine the brain area specific for dual-task processing;
      however, the results of these studies supported the overlap hypothesis, which
      explains the neural mechanisms for allocating cognitive resources and the
      interference effect between two tasks during dual-task performances. Recent
      neurophysiological studies using monkeys revealed that neurons exhibiting
      dual-task selective activity are present in the prefrontal cortex and that
      dual-task interference is caused by the simultaneous and overloaded recruitment
      of the same prefrontal neural population by the two tasks. These results provide 
      direct neural evidence for psychological concepts of cognitive resources and its 
      capacity limitation.

TI  - Paralimbic and lateral prefrontal encoding of reward value during intertemporal
      choice in attempted suicide.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alongside impulsive suicide attempts, clinicians encounter highly
      premeditated suicidal acts, particularly in older adults. We have previously
      found that in contrast to the more impulsive suicide attempters' inability to
      delay gratification, serious and highly planned suicide attempts were associated 
      with greater willingness to wait for larger rewards. This study examined neural
      underpinnings of intertemporal preference in suicide attempters. We expected that
      impulsivity and suicide attempts, particularly poorly planned ones, would predict
      altered paralimbic subjective value representations. We also examined lateral
      prefrontal and paralimbic correlates of premeditation in suicidal behavior.
      METHOD: A total of 48 participants aged 46-90 years underwent extensive clinical 
      and cognitive characterization and completed the delay discounting task in the
      scanner: 26 individuals with major depression (13 with and 13 without history of 
      suicide attempts) and 22 healthy controls. RESULTS: More impulsive individuals
      displayed greater activation in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to
      value difference favoring the delayed option. Suicide attempts, particularly
      better-planned ones, were associated with deactivation of the lateral prefrontal 
      cortex (lPFC) in response to value difference favoring the immediate option.
      Findings were robust to medication exposure, depression severity and possible
      brain damage from suicide attempts, among other confounders. Finally, in suicide 
      attempters longer reward delays were associated with diminished parahippocampal
      responses. CONCLUSIONS: Impulsivity was associated with an altered paralimbic
      (precuneus/PCC) encoding of value difference during intertemporal choice. By
      contrast, better-planned suicidal acts were associated with altered lPFC
      representations of value difference. The study provides preliminary evidence of
      impaired decision processes in both impulsive and premeditated suicidal behavior.

TI  - Brain activity on fMRI associated with urinary bladder filling in patients with a
      complete spinal cord injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with complete spinal cord injury (SCI) may maintain some
      perception of bladder fullness. The aim of the study was to evaluate brain
      activation arising from anticipated extraspinal sensory pathways. METHODS:
      Fourteen patients ages 24-54 years were enrolled, all having experienced a
      complete SCI (ASIA A) at C7 to T5 an average of 17 months before study entry.
      Urodynamic equipment was used for repeated bladder filling and detrusor activity 
      evaluation. All functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements were performed
      using a Siemens Trio 3T scanner with the GRE-EPI sequence (field of view = 192 x 
      192 mm, voxel 3 x 3 x 3 mm, TR/TE = 3000/30 ms, 45 slices). Nine hundred dynamic 
      scans were acquired over 45 min. Statistical analysis was done in SPM8 using a
      general linear model. Statistics using t-tests were thresholded at P = 0.001.
      RESULTS: We excluded results from two patients because of activation artifacts.
      In 8 of 12 patients, significant brain activity was observed during urinary
      bladder filling. We found significant activation clusters at the nucleus of the
      solitary tract (NTS) (3/8), parabrachial nucleus (PBN) (4/8), hypothalamus (4/8),
      thalamus (6/8), amygdala (7/8), insular lobe (5/8), anterior cingulate gyrus
      (5/8), and prefrontal cortex (8/8). Activations in nuclei involved in afferents
      likely from the vagal nerve (NTS and PBN) correlated significantly with reported 
      bladder sensations. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that extraspinal sensory
      pathways may develop following SCI and that vagal nerve may play a role in
      re-innervation of the urinary bladder. Neurourol. Urodynam. (c) 2015 Wiley

TI  - Psychobiology of threat appraisal in the context of psychotic experiences: A
      selective review.

AB  - A key factor in the transition to psychosis is the appraisal of anomalous
      experiences as threatening. Cognitive models of psychosis have identified
      attentional and interpretative biases underlying threat-based appraisals. While
      much research has been conducted into these biases within the clinical and
      cognitive literature, little examination has occurred at the neural level.
      However, neurobiological research in social cognition employing threatening
      stimuli mirror cognitive accounts of maladaptive appraisal in psychosis. This
      review attempted to integrate neuroimaging data regarding social cognition in
      psychosis with the concepts of attentional and interpretative threat biases.
      Systematic review methodology was used to identify relevant articles from
      Medline, PsycINFO and EMBASE, and PubMed databases. The selective review showed
      that attentional and interpretative threat biases relate to abnormal activation
      of a range of subcortical and prefrontal structures, including the amygdala,
      insula, hippocampus, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortex, as well as
      disrupted connectivity between these regions, when processing threatening and
      neutral or ambiguous stimuli. Notably, neural findings regarding the
      misattribution of threat to neutral or ambiguous stimuli presented a more
      consistent picture. Overall, however, the findings for any specific emotion were 
      mixed, both in terms of the specific brain areas involved and the direction of
      effects (increased/decreased activity), possibly owing to confounds including
      small sample sizes, varying experimental paradigms, medication, and
      heterogeneous, in some cases poorly characterised, patient groups. Further
      neuroimaging research examining these biases by employing experimentally induced 
      anomalous perceptual experiences and well-characterised large samples is needed
      for greater aetiological specificity.

AB  - People categorize objects more slowly when visual input is highly impoverished
      instead of optimal. While bottom-up models may explain a decision with optimal
      input, perceptual hypothesis testing (PHT) theories implicate top-down processes 
      with impoverished input. Brain mechanisms and the time course of PHT are largely 
      unknown. This event-related potential study used a neuroimaging paradigm that
      implicated prefrontal cortex in top-down modulation of occipitotemporal cortex.
      Subjects categorized more impoverished and less impoverished real and pseudo
      objects. PHT theories predict larger impoverishment effects for real than pseudo 
      objects because top-down processes modulate knowledge only for real objects, but 
      different PHT variants predict different timing. Consistent with
      parietal-prefrontal PHT variants, around 250 ms, the earliest impoverished real
      object interaction started on an N3 complex, which reflects interactive cortical 
      activity for object cognition. N3 impoverishment effects localized to both
      prefrontal and occipitotemporal cortex for real objects only. The N3 also showed 
      knowledge effects by 230 ms that localized to occipitotemporal cortex. Later
      effects reflected (a) word meaning in temporal cortex during the N400, (b)
      internal evaluation of prior decision and memory processes and secondary
      higher-order memory involving anterotemporal parts of a default mode network
      during posterior positivity (P600), and (c) response related activity in
      posterior cingulate during an anterior slow wave (SW) after 700 ms. Finally,
      response activity in supplementary motor area during a posterior SW after 900 ms 
      showed impoverishment effects that correlated with RTs. Convergent evidence from 
      studies of vision, memory, and mental imagery which reflects purely top-down
      inputs, indicates that the N3 reflects the critical top-down processes of PHT. A 
      hybrid multiple-state interactive, PHT and decision theory best explains the
      visual constancy of object cognition.

TI  - Gender differences in human single neuron responses to male emotional faces.
PG  - 499
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00499 [doi]
AB  - Well-documented differences in the psychology and behavior of men and women have 
      spurred extensive exploration of gender's role within the brain, particularly
      regarding emotional processing. While neuroanatomical studies clearly show
      differences between the sexes, the functional effects of these differences are
      less understood. Neuroimaging studies have shown inconsistent locations and
      magnitudes of gender differences in brain hemodynamic responses to emotion. To
      better understand the neurophysiology of these gender differences, we analyzed
      recordings of single neuron activity in the human brain as subjects of both
      genders viewed emotional expressions. This study included recordings of
      single-neuron activity of 14 (6 male) epileptic patients in four brain areas:
      amygdala (236 neurons), hippocampus (n = 270), anterior cingulate cortex (n =
      256), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (n = 174). Neural activity was recorded 
      while participants viewed a series of avatar male faces portraying positive,
      negative or neutral expressions. Significant gender differences were found in the
      left amygdala, where 23% (n = 1566) of neurons in men were significantly affected
      by facial emotion, vs. 8% (n = 676) of neurons in women. A Fisher's exact test
      comparing the two ratios found a highly significant difference between the two (p
      < 0.01). These results show specific differences between genders at the
      single-neuron level in the human amygdala. These differences may reflect
      gender-based distinctions in evolved capacities for emotional processing and also
      demonstrate the importance of including subject gender as an independent factor
      in future studies of emotional processing by single neurons in the human
      amygdala.

AB  - We report a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study which investigated
      whether brain areas involved in updating task rules within the frontal lobe of
      the cerebral cortex show activity related to the modality of motor response used 
      in the task. Participants performed a rule switching task using different
      effector modalities. In some blocks participants responded with left/right button
      presses, whilst in other blocks left/right saccades were required. The color of a
      Cue event instructed a left or right response based upon a rule, followed by a
      Feedback which indicated whether the rule was to stay the same or "Flip" on the
      next trial. The findings revealed variation in the locus of activity within the
      ventrolateral frontal cortex dependent upon effector modality. Other frontal
      areas showed no significant difference in activity between response epochs but
      changed their pattern of connectivity with posterior cortical areas dependent
      upon response. Multivariate analysis revealed that the pattern of activity evoked
      by Flip rule Feedbacks within an apparently supra modal frontal region
      (dorsolateral frontal cortex) discriminated between response epochs. The results 
      are consistent with the existence of multi-modal representations of
      stimulus-response (SR) rules within the frontal cerebral cortex.

      taste-experience of food products.
PG  - 247
LID - 10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00247 [doi]
AB  - Value-based decision making occurs when individuals choose between different
      alternatives and place a value on each alternative and its attributes. Marketing 
      actions frequently manipulate product attributes, by adding, e.g., health claims 
      on the packaging. A previous imaging study found that an emblem for organic
      products increased willingness to pay (WTP) and activity in the ventral striatum 
      (VS). The current study investigated neural and behavioral processes underlying
      the influence of Fair Trade (FT) labeling on food valuation and choice.
      Sustainability is an important product attribute for many consumers, with FT
      signals being one way to highlight ethically sustainable production. Forty
      participants valuated products in combination with an FT emblem or no emblem and 
      stated their WTP in a bidding task while in an MRI scanner. After that,
      participants tasted-objectively identical-chocolates, presented either as "FT" or
      as "conventionally produced". In the fMRI task, WTP was significantly higher for 
      FT products. FT labeling increased activity in regions important for
      reward-processing and salience, that is, in the VS, anterior and posterior
      cingulate, as well as superior frontal gyrus. Subjective value, that is, WTP was 
      correlated with activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). We find
      that the anterior cingulate, VS and superior frontal gyrus exhibit task-related
      increases in functional connectivity to the vmPFC when an FT product was
      evaluated. Effective connectivity analyses revealed a highly probable directed
      modulation of the vmPFC by those three regions, suggesting a network which alters
      valuation processes. We also found a significant taste-placebo effect, with
      higher experienced taste pleasantness and intensity for FT labeled chocolates.
      Our results reveal a possible neural mechanism underlying valuation processes of 
      certified food products. The results are important in light of understanding
      current marketing trends as well as designing future interventions that aim at
      positively influencing food choice.

AB  - Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental
      disorder. In an attempt to extend earlier neurochemical findings, we organized a 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study as part of a large,
      government-funded, prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial comparing 
      the effectiveness of specific psychotherapy with counseling and stimulant
      treatment with placebo treatment (Comparison of Methylphenidate and Psychotherapy
      Study). We report the baseline neurochemical data for the anterior cingulate
      cortex (ACC) and the cerebellum in a case-control setting. For the trial, 1,480
      adult patients were contacted for participation, 518 were assessed for
      eligibility, 433 were randomized, and 187 were potentially eligible for
      neuroimaging. The control group included 119 healthy volunteers. Single-voxel
      proton MRS was performed. In the patient group, 113 ACC and 104 cerebellar
      spectra fulfilled all quality criteria for inclusion in statistical calculations,
      as did 82 ACC and 78 cerebellar spectra in the control group. We did not find any
      significant neurometabolic differences between the ADHD and control group in the 
      ACC (Wilks' lambda test: p = 0.97) or in the cerebellum (p = 0.62). Thus, we were
      unable to replicate earlier findings in this methodologically sophisticated
      study. We discuss our findings in the context of a comprehensive review of other 
      MRS studies on ADHD and a somewhat skeptical neuropsychiatric research
      perspective. As in other neuropsychiatric disorders, the unclear nosological
      status of ADHD might be an explanation for false-negative findings.

TI  - Reductions in Cortico-Striatal Hyperconnectivity Accompany Successful Treatment
      of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Dorsomedial Prefrontal rTMS.
LID - 10.1038/npp.2015.292 [doi]
AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling illness with high rates of
      nonresponse to conventional treatments. OCD pathophysiology is believed to
      involve abnormalities in cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuits through
      regions such as dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and ventral striatum. These
      regions may constitute therapeutic targets for neuromodulation treatments, such
      as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). However, the
      neurobiological predictors and correlates of successful rTMS treatment for OCD
      are unclear. Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) to identify neural predictors and correlates of response to 20-30 sessions
      of bilateral 10 Hz dmPFC-rTMS in 20 treatment-resistant OCD patients, with 40
      healthy controls as baseline comparators. A region of interest in the dmPFC was
      used to generate whole-brain functional connectivity maps pre-treatment and post 
      treatment. Ten of 20 patients met the response criteria (50% improvement on
      Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, YBOCS); response to dmPFC-rTMS was sharply
      bimodal. dmPFC-rTMS responders had higher dmPFC-ventral striatal connectivity at 
      baseline. The degree of reduction in this connectivity, from pre- to
      post-treatment, correlated to the degree of YBOCS symptomatic improvement.
      Baseline clinical and psychometric data did not predict treatment response. In
      summary, reductions in fronto-striatal hyperconnectivity were associated with
      treatment response to dmPFC-rTMS in OCD. This finding is consistent with previous
      fMRI studies of deep brain stimulation in OCD, but opposite to previous reports
      on mechanisms of dmPFC-rTMS in major depression. fMRI could prove useful in
      predicting the response to dmPFC-rTMS in OCD.Neuropsychopharmacology advance

AB  - Sickness behaviors have become the focus of great interest in recent years as
      they represent a clear case of how peripheral disturbances in immune signaling
      can disrupt quite complex behaviors. In the current study, we were interested in 
      examining whether we could identify any significant morphological disturbances in
      microglia associated with these sickness-like behaviors in adult male
      Sprague-Dawley rats. We chose lipopolysaccharide (LPS 100mug/kg/i.p.), to induce 
      sickness-like behaviors as it is the most well-validated approach to do so in
      rodents and humans. We were particularly interested in examining changes in
      microglia within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as several recent neuroimaging
      studies have highlighted significant functional changes in this region following 
      peripheral LPS administration. Paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue was collected from
      animals 24h post LPS administration and labeled immunohistochemically with an
      antibody directed to bind to Iba-1, a protein known to be involved in the
      structural remodeling of microglia. To analyze changes, we have made use of two
      recently described image analysis procedures. The first is known as cumulative
      threshold spectra (CTS) analysis. The second involves the unsupervised digital
      reconstruction of microglia. We undertook these complementary analysis of
      microglial cells in the both the pre- and infralimbic divisions of the PFC. Our
      results indicated that microglial soma size was significantly enlarged, while
      cell processes had contracted slightly following LPS administration. To our
      knowledge this study is to first to definitely demonstrate substantial microglial
      disturbances within the PFC following LPS delivered at a dose that was sufficient
      to induce significant sickness-like behavior.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that higher aerobic fitness is related to higher
      cognitive function and higher task-related prefrontal activation in older adults.
      However, a holistic picture of these factors has yet to be presented. As a
      typical age-related change of brain activation, less lateralized activity in the 
      prefrontal cortex during cognitive tasks has been observed in various
      neuroimaging studies. Thus, this study aimed to reveal the relationship between
      aerobic fitness, cognitive function, and frontal lateralization. Sixty male older
      adults each performed a submaximal incremental exercise test to determine their
      oxygen intake (V.O2) at ventilatory threshold (VT) in order to index their
      aerobic fitness. They performed a color-word Stroop task while prefrontal
      activation was monitored using functional near infrared spectroscopy. As an index
      of cognitive function, Stroop interference time was analyzed. Partial correlation
      analyses revealed significant correlations among higher VT, shorter Stroop
      interference time and greater left-lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) activation when adjusting for education. Moreover, mediation analyses
      showed that left-lateralized DLPFC activation significantly mediated the
      association between VT and Stroop interference time. These results suggest that
      higher aerobic fitness is associated with cognitive function via lateralized
      frontal activation in older adults.

TI  - Predicting the future relapse of alcohol-dependent patients from structural and
      functional brain images.
LID - 10.1111/adb.12302 [doi]
AB  - In alcohol dependence, individual prediction of treatment outcome based on
      neuroimaging endophenotypes can help to tailor individual therapeutic offers to
      patients depending on their relapse risk. We built a prediction model for
      prospective relapse of alcohol-dependent patients that combines structural and
      functional brain images derived from an experiment in which 46 subjects were
      exposed to alcohol-related cues. The patient group had been subdivided post hoc
      regarding relapse behavior defined as a consumption of more than 60 g alcohol for
      male or more than 40 g alcohol for female patients on one occasion during the
      3-month assessment period (16 abstainers and 30 relapsers). Naive Bayes, support 
      vector machines and learning vector quantization were used to infer prediction
      models for relapse based on the mean and maximum values of gray matter volume and
      brain responses on alcohol-related cues within a priori defined regions of
      interest. Model performance was estimated by leave-one-out cross-validation.
      Learning vector quantization yielded the model with the highest balanced accuracy
      (79.4 percent, p < 0.0001; 90 percent sensitivity, 68.8 percent specificity). The
      most informative individual predictors were functional brain activation features 
      in the right and left ventral tegmental areas and the right ventral striatum, as 
      well as gray matter volume features in left orbitofrontal cortex and right medial
      prefrontal cortex. In contrast, the best pure clinical model reached only
      chance-level accuracy (61.3 percent). Our results indicate that an individual
      prediction of future relapse from imaging measurement outperforms prediction from
      clinical measurements. The approach may help to target specific interventions at 
      different risk groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to explore the neuroanatomical bases of
      vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) with respect to attention/executive
      function, memory, language, and visuospatial function. METHODS: We used
      voxel-based morphometric analysis to identify brain regions that significantly
      differed in terms of gray matter volumes (GMVs) between 43 patients with VaMCI
      and 55 healthy controls. Then, we compared the individual GMVs of the selected
      regions with the neuropsychological profiles of the VaMCI patients. RESULTS: The 
      delayed recall component of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (CFT) (74.4%),
      the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (74.4%), the Boston Naming Test (51.2%), and the
      CFT-copy (81.4%) shared the highest incidence of impairment in the 4 cognitive
      domains, respectively. Compared with controls, patients with VaMCI exhibited
      significantly reduced GMVs. This effect was mainly present in the frontal
      regions, including the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the
      orbital portion of the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and the left supplemental
      motor area, and was also observed in the bilateral posterior cingulated cortex
      (PCC). GMVs were significantly correlated with performance in the Trail Making
      Test, part B, in the bilateral DLPFC and PCC, the clock drawing test in the right
      orbital portion of the SFG, and CFT-delayed recall in the right PCC. CONCLUSIONS:
      These results, from the perspective of brain morphology, uniquely explored the
      specific cerebral structural changes of VaMCI, thus providing a deeper
      understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease.

AB  - Structural covariance, the examination of anatomic correlations between brain
      regions, has emerged recently as a valid and useful measure of developmental
      brain changes. Yet the exact biological processes leading to changes in
      covariance, and the relation between such covariance and behavior, remain largely
      unexplored. The steroid hormone testosterone represents a compelling mechanism
      through which this structural covariance may be developmentally regulated in
      humans. Although steroid hormone receptors can be found throughout the central
      nervous system, the amygdala represents a key target for testosterone-specific
      effects, given its high density of androgen receptors. In addition, testosterone 
      has been found to impact cortical thickness (CTh) across the whole brain,
      suggesting that it may also regulate the structural relationship, or covariance, 
      between the amygdala and CTh. Here, we examined testosterone-related covariance
      between amygdala volumes and whole-brain CTh, as well as its relationship to
      aggression levels, in a longitudinal sample of children, adolescents, and young
      adults 6-22 years old. We found: (1) testosterone-specific modulation of the
      covariance between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); (2) a
      significant relationship between amygdala-mPFC covariance and levels of
      aggression; and (3) mediation effects of amygdala-mPFC covariance on the
      relationship between testosterone and aggression. These effects were independent 
      of sex, age, pubertal stage, estradiol levels and anxious-depressed symptoms.
      These findings are consistent with prior evidence that testosterone targets the
      neural circuits regulating affect and impulse regulation, and show, for the first
      time in humans, how androgen-dependent organizational effects may regulate a very
      specific, aggression-related structural brain phenotype from childhood to young
      adulthood.

TI  - The timing of language learning shapes brain structure associated with
      articulation.
AB  - We compared the brain structure of highly proficient simultaneous (two languages 
      from birth) and sequential (second language after age 5) bilinguals, who differed
      only in their degree of native-like accent, to determine how the brain develops
      when a skill is acquired from birth versus later in life. For the simultaneous
      bilinguals, gray matter density was increased in the left putamen, as well as in 
      the left posterior insula, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left and
      right occipital cortex. For the sequential bilinguals, gray matter density was
      increased in the bilateral premotor cortex. Sequential bilinguals with better
      accents also showed greater gray matter density in the left putamen, and in
      several additional brain regions important for sensorimotor integration and
      speech-motor control. Our findings suggest that second language learning results 
      in enhanced brain structure of specific brain areas, which depends on whether two
      languages are learned simultaneously or sequentially, and on the extent to which 
      native-like proficiency is acquired.

TI  - Meta-analysis of real-time fMRI neurofeedback studies using individual
      participant data: How is brain regulation mediated?
PG  - 806-812

LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.09.042 [doi]
AB  - An increasing number of studies using real-time fMRI neurofeedback have
      demonstrated that successful regulation of neural activity is possible in various
      brain regions. Since these studies focused on the regulated region(s), little is 
      known about the target-independent mechanisms associated with
      neurofeedback-guided control of brain activation, i.e. the regulating network.
      While the specificity of the activation during self-regulation is an important
      factor, no study has effectively determined the network involved in
      self-regulation in general. In an effort to detect regions that are responsible
      for the act of brain regulation, we performed a post-hoc analysis of data
      involving different target regions based on studies from different research
      groups. We included twelve suitable studies that examined nine different target
      regions amounting to a total of 175 subjects and 899 neurofeedback runs. Data
      analysis included a standard first- (single subject, extracting main paradigm)
      and second-level (single subject, all runs) general linear model (GLM) analysis
      of all participants taking into account the individual timing. Subsequently, at
      the third level, a random effects model GLM included all subjects of all studies,
      resulting in an overall mixed effects model. Since four of the twelve studies had
      a reduced field of view (FoV), we repeated the same analysis in a subsample of
      eight studies that had a well-overlapping FoV to obtain a more global picture of 
      self-regulation. The GLM analysis revealed that the anterior insula as well as
      the basal ganglia, notably the striatum, were consistently active during the
      regulation of brain activation across the studies. The anterior insula has been
      implicated in interoceptive awareness of the body and cognitive control. Basal
      ganglia are involved in procedural learning, visuomotor integration and other
      higher cognitive processes including motivation. The larger FoV analysis yielded 
      additional activations in the anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsolateral and
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the temporo-parietal area and the visual
      association areas including the temporo-occipital junction. In conclusion, we
      demonstrate that several key regions, such as the anterior insula and the basal
      ganglia, are consistently activated during self-regulation in real-time fMRI
      neurofeedback independent of the targeted region-of-interest. Our results imply
      that if the real-time fMRI neurofeedback studies target regions of this
      regulation network, such as the anterior insula, care should be given whether
      activation changes are related to successful regulation, or related to the
      regulation process per se. Furthermore, future research is needed to determine
      how activation within this regulation network is related to neurofeedback
      success.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by atrophy within the
      prefrontal-limbic network. Graph analysis was used to investigate to what degree 
      atrophy in PTSD is associated with impaired structural connectivity within
      prefrontal limbic network (restricted) and how this affects the integration of
      the prefrontal limbic network with the rest of the brain (whole-brain). 85 male
      veterans (45 PTSD neg, 40 PTSD pos) underwent volumetric MRI on a 3T MR. Subfield
      volumes were obtained using a manual labeling scheme and cortical thickness
      measurements and subcortical volumes from FreeSurfer. Regression analysis was
      used to identify regions with volume loss. Graph analytical Toolbox (GAT) was
      used for graph-analysis. PTSD pos had a thinner rostral anterior cingulate and
      insular cortex but no hippocampal volume loss. PTSD was characterized by
      decreased nodal degree (orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate) and clustering
      coefficients (thalamus) but increased nodal betweenness (insula, orbitofrontal)
      and a reduced small world index in the whole brain analysis and by orbitofrontal 
      and insular nodes with increased nodal degree, clustering coefficient and nodal
      betweenness in the restricted analysis. PTSD associated atrophy in the
      prefrontal-limbic network results in an increased structural connectivity within 
      that network that negatively affected its integration with the rest of the brain.

      study.
PG  - 176
LID - 10.1186/s12883-015-0434-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report a patient with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy
      with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), who showed injuries 
      of the neural tracts, which was demonstrated by diffusion tensor tractography
      (DTT). CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old male patient and seven age-matched
      control volunteers were recruited. Since approximately 1.5 years ago, he had felt
      mild weakness of the right arm and was diagnosed as CADASIL by the finding of the
      exon 11 mutation of the NOTCH3 gene approximately 10 months ago. T2-weighted and 
      FLAIR brain MRI images obtained at admission showed high signal intensity lesions
      in the subcortical gray matter and periventricular white matter. He showed mild
      quadriparesis, mild dysarthria, mild cognitive impairment, and emotional
      problems. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed and nine neural tracts
      (corticospinal tract, corticobulbar tract, corticofugal tract from the
      supplementary motor area, corticofugal tract from the premotor cortex,
      thalmoprefrontal tract [TPT] to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, TPT to the
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, TPT to the orbitoprefrontal cortex, fornix, and 
      cingulum) were reconstructed. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), 
      and tract volume of each neural tract were measured. All neural tracts except for
      the left fornix showed at least one more abnormality in terms of DTT parameters
      (decrement of FA, increment of MD, or decrement of tract volume). CONCLUSION: We 
      demonstrated injuries of the neural tracts in a patient with CADASIL. It appears 
      that clinical manifestations in this patient were related to injuries of the
      neural tracts.

TI  - Cortical Thinning and Altered Cortico-Cortical Structural Covariance of the
      Default Mode Network in Patients with Persistent Insomnia Symptoms.
LID - sp-00058-15 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have suggested that structural abnormalities in
      insomnia may be linked with alterations in the default-mode network (DMN). This
      study compared cortical thickness and structural connectivity linked to the DMN
      in patients with persistent insomnia (PI) and good sleepers (GS). DESIGN:
      Clinical subsample from population-based longitudinal study. SETTING: Subsample
      from community-based sample from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study
      (KoGES). PARTICIPANTS: This study compared cortical thickness and structural
      connectivity linked to the DMN in patients with persistent insomnia symptoms
      (PIS; n = 57) and good sleepers (GS; n = 40). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS:
      Participants underwent MRI acquisition. Based on literature review, we selected
      cortical regions corresponding to the DMN. A seed-based structural covariance
      analysis measured cortical thickness correlation between each seed region of the 
      DMN and other cortical areas. Association of cortical thickness and covariance
      with sleep quality and neuropsychological assessments were further assessed.
      Compared to GS, cortical thinning was found in PIS in the anterior cingulate
      cortex, precentral cortex, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Decreased structural
      connectivity between anterior and posterior regions of the DMN was observed in
      the PIS group. Decreased structural covariance within the DMN was associated with
      higher PSQI scores. Cortical thinning in the lateral frontal lobe was related to 
      poor performance in executive function in PIS. CONCLUSION: Disrupted structural
      covariance network in PIS might reflect malfunctioning of antero-posterior
      disconnection of the DMN during the wake to sleep transition that is commonly
      found during normal sleep. The observed structural network alteration may further
      implicate commonly observed sustained sleep difficulties and cognitive impairment
      in insomnia.

TI  - Long-term abnormalities in the corpus callosum of female concussed athletes.
AB  - Concussion is an injury affecting millions of individuals annually that can be
      associated with long-term sequelae. Recent studies have reported long-term
      abnormalities in the white matter (WM) tracts of male athletes. The corpus
      callosum (CC) and corticospinal tract (CST) have been shown to be particularly
      vulnerable to concussion, which may be related to abnormal interhemispheric
      functional connectivity and motor impairments. These anatomical pathways,
      however, have not been investigated in female athletes despite the functional
      significance of the CC and CST to adequate sports performance. In the present
      study, 8 healthy, unconcussed female athletes (soccer, hockey) were compared to
      10 female athletes (soccer, hockey, water-polo) six months post-concussion.
      Diffusion tensor imaging of the CC and CST was conducted in a 3T MRI scanner. DTI
      analysis showed no significant differences between groups within the CST but
      revealed differences between groups in the CC. The concussed group had lower mean
      diffusivity (t=2.14; p=0.048) and lower radial diffusivity (t=2.91; p=0.010) in
      the region of the corpus callosum projecting to the prefrontal cortex. A lower
      volume of WM fibers was found in the region projecting to the premotor and
      supplementary motor areas (t=2.14; p=0.048). Finally, lower axial diffusivity was
      observed in the CC area projecting mainly to the parietal and temporal area
      (t=2.23; p=0.041). Long-term alterations in the corpus callosum of female
      athletes appear to affect mostly the anterior part of the CC projecting to the
      prefrontal and premotor areas. Further studies are needed to determine whether
      these alterations are associated with a higher risk of sustaining a subsequent
      concussive injury.

AB  - Tinnitus and chronic pain are sensory-perceptual disorders associated with
      negative affect and high impact on well-being and behavior. It is now becoming
      increasingly clear that higher cognitive and affective brain systems are
      centrally involved in the pathology of both disorders. We propose that the
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens are part of a central
      'gatekeeping' system in both sensory modalities, a system which evaluates the
      relevance and affective value of sensory stimuli and controls information flow
      via descending pathways. If this frontostriatal system is compromised,
      long-lasting disturbances are the result. Parallels in both systems are striking 
      and mutually informative, and progress in understanding central gating mechanisms
      might provide a new impetus to the therapy of tinnitus and chronic pain.

TI  - Brain Structural Effects of Antidepressant Treatment in Major Depression.
PG  - 458-65
AB  - Depressive disorder is a very frequent and heterogeneous syndrome. Structural
      imaging techniques offer a useful tool in the comprehension of neurobiological
      alterations that concern depressive disorder. Altered brain structures in
      depressive disorder have been particularly located in the prefrontal cortex
      (medial prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex, OFC) and medial temporal
      cortex areas (hippocampus). These brain areas belong to a structural and
      functional network related to cognitive and emotional processes putatively
      implicated in depressive symptoms. These volumetric alterations may also
      represent biological predictors of response to pharmacological treatment. In this
      context, major findings of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, in relation to
      treatment response in depressive disorder, will here be presented and discussed.

TI  - Morphometric changes in the reward system of Parkinson's disease patients with
      impulse control disorders.
AB  - Impulse control disorders (ICDs) occur in a subset of patients with Parkinson's
      disease (PD) who are receiving dopamine replacement therapy. In this study, we
      aimed to investigate structural abnormalities within the mesocortical and limbic 
      cortices and subcortical structures in PD patients with ICDs. We studied 18 PD
      patients with ICDs, 18 PD patients without ICDs and a group of 24 age and
      sex-matched healthy controls. Cortical thickness (CTh) and subcortical nuclei
      volume analyses were carried out using the automated surface-based analysis
      package FreeSurfer (version 5.3.0). We found significant differences in MRI
      measures between the three groups. There was volume loss in the nucleus accumbens
      of both PD patients with ICDs and without ICDs compared to the control group. In 
      addition, PD patients with ICDs showed significant atrophy in caudate,
      hippocampus and amygdala compared to the group of healthy controls. PD patients
      with ICDs had significant increased cortical thickness in rostral anterior
      cingulate cortex and frontal pole compared to PD patients without ICDs. Cortical 
      thickness in rostral anterior cingulate and frontal pole was increased in PD
      patients with ICDs compared to the control group, but the differences failed to
      reach corrected levels of statistical significance. PD patients with ICDs showed 
      increased cortical thickness in medial prefrontal regions. We speculate that
      these findings reflect either a pre-existing neural trait vulnerability to
      impulsivity or the expression of a maladaptive synaptic plasticity under
      non-physiological dopaminergic stimulation.

AB  - Rapid progress had been made towards the effect of Internet addiction (IA) on the
      adolescents brain, relatively little is known about the alterations in
      inter-hemispheric resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) changes. In the
      current study, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) was used to examine
      inter-hemispheric RSFC in IA adolescents (n=21) and controls (n=21). The
      integrity of the fibers connecting the regions, which showed aberrant
      inter-hemispheric functional connectivity, was assessed by fiber tractography
      analysis. In addition, the coupling of inter-hemispheric functional and
      structural connectivity was investigated. Relative to controls, IA adolescents
      showed decreased VMHC of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and reduced
      fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the genu of corpus callosum (CC). The
      decreased VMHC of DLPFC was significantly negative correlated with the duration
      of IA. Moreover, the VMHC of DLPFC showed significant correlations with the FA of
      CC in healthy controls, which was disrupted in IA. Our findings provided more
      scientific evidence for the involvement of DLPFC in IA. It is hoped that
      multimodal imaging methods can provide deeper insights into the IA effects on the
      brain.

AB  - Methylphenidate and atomoxetine are effective in treating
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with underlying distinct
      pharmacological mechanisms. To relate neural mechanisms to clinical response, we 
      conducted a comparative trial to differentiate the changes in brain activation of
      drug-naive children with ADHD when performing neuropsychological tasks after 12
      weeks of pharmacotherapy. We randomized 50 drug-naive children with ADHD, aged
      7-17, to treatment with methylphenidate (n=25) or atomoxetine (n=25). These
      children were scanned twice with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      during the counting Stroop task before and after treatment. Focused attention and
      impulsivity were assessed twice by using the Conner's Continuous Performance Test
      (CCPT). The final sample for fMRI analysis comprised 20 in the methylphenidate
      group and 22 in the atomoxetine group. Atomoxetine decreased activations in the
      dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which
      correlated with improvement in focused attention assessed by the CCPT. In
      contrast, methylphenidate increased activations in the inferior frontal gyrus,
      which correlated with the decreasing severity of impulsivity assessed by the
      CCPT. The current findings suggest that differential therapeutic effects on
      neuronal changes induced by 12-week treatment atomoxetine and methylphenidate may
      contribute to behavioral improvement.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its connections with other brain areas are
      crucial for cognitive function. Cognitive impairments are one of the core
      symptoms associated with schizophrenia, and manifest even before the onset of the
      disorder. Altered neural networks involving PFC contribute to cognitive
      impairments in schizophrenia. Both genetic and environmental risk factors affect 
      the development of the local circuitry within PFC as well as development of
      broader brain networks, and make the system vulnerable to further insults during 
      adolescence, leading to the onset of the disorder in young adulthood. Since
      spared cognitive functions correlate with functional outcome and prognosis, a
      better understanding of the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments will have
      important implications for novel therapeutics for schizophrenia focusing on
      cognitive functions. Multidisciplinary approaches, from basic neuroscience to
      clinical studies, are required to link molecules, circuitry, networks, and
      behavioral phenotypes. Close interactions among such fields by sharing a common
      language on connectomes, behavioral readouts, and other concepts are crucial for 
      this goal.

AB  - Deficits in verbal learning and memory are a prominent feature of neurocognitive 
      function in HIV-infected women, and are associated with high levels of perceived 
      stress. To understand the neurobiological factors contributing to this
      stress-related memory impairment, we examined the association between stress,
      verbal memory, and brain volumes in HIV-infected women. Participants included 38 
      HIV-infected women (Mean age=43.9years) from the Chicago Consortium of the
      Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). Participants underwent structural magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) and completed standardized measures of verbal learning
      and memory and stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10; PSS-10). Brain volumes were
      evaluated in a priori regions of interest, including the medial temporal lobe
      (MTL) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Compared to HIV-infected women with lower
      stress (PSS-10 scores in lower two tertiles), HIV-infected women with higher
      stress (scores in the top tertile), performed worse on measures of verbal
      learning and memory and showed smaller volumes bilaterally in the parahippocampal
      gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus
      (p's<0.05). Reduced volumes in the inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, 
      and superior frontal gyrus (all right hemisphere) were negatively associated with
      verbal learning and memory performance. Prefrontal cortical atrophy is associated
      with stress-related deficits in verbal learning and memory in HIV-infected women.
      The time course of these volume losses in relation to memory deficits has yet to 
      be elucidated, but the magnitude of the volumetric differences between women with
      higher versus lower stress suggests a prolonged vulnerability due to chronic
      stress and/or early life trauma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Growing evidence indicates that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) stems
      from abnormal structural and functional connectivity of neural networks. Although
      diagnostic symptoms are sociocommunicative, motor-related functions (beyond
      repetitive mannerisms) are also impaired. However, evidence on connectivity at
      the level of basic motor execution is limited, which we address here. METHOD: We 
      compared right-handed children and adolescents (aged 7-18 years) with ASD (n =
      44) to matched typically developing participants (TD, n = 36) using magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). Diffusion-weighted imaging and probabilistic
      tractography measured microstructure of the corticospinal tract (CST). Intrinsic 
      functional connectivity MRI examined whole-brain voxelwise correlations, both
      with identical precentral gyrus (PCG) seeds. RESULTS: In the group with ASD,
      radial and mean diffusivity were increased bilaterally in the CST, particularly
      in superior segments, and a leftward asymmetry of CST volume detected in the TD
      group was reversed. Functionally, overconnectivity was found for both left and
      right PCG with prefrontal, parietal, medial occipital, and cingulate cortices.
      The group with ASD also showed significantly reduced asymmetry of functional
      connectivity for both left and right PCG seeds. Finally, in the group with ASD,
      significant correlations were found for functional overconnectivity of the right 
      PCG seed with anisotropy and mean diffusivity in the right CST. CONCLUSION: The
      findings, implicating both functional and anatomical connectivity of the primary 
      motor cortex, suggest that network anomalies in ASD go well beyond
      sociocommunicative domains, affecting basic motor execution. They also suggest
      that even in right-handed adolescents with ASD, typical left hemisphere dominance
      is reduced, both anatomically and functionally, with an unusual degree of right
      hemisphere motor participation.

LID - S0890-8567(15)00457-8 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often present with
      deficits in episodic memory, and there is evidence that these difficulties may be
      secondary to executive dysfunction, that is, impaired selection and/or
      application of memory-encoding strategies (mediation hypothesis). Semantic
      clustering is an effective strategy to enhance encoding of verbal episodic memory
      (VEM) when word lists are semantically related. Self-initiated mobilization of
      this strategy has been associated with increased activity in the prefrontal
      cortex, particularly the orbitofrontal cortex, a key region in the
      pathophysiology of OCD. We therefore studied children and adolescents with OCD
      during uncued semantic clustering strategy application in a VEM functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-encoding paradigm. METHOD: A total of 25
      pediatric patients with OCD (aged 8.1-17.5 years) and 25 healthy controls (HC,
      aged 8.1-16.9) matched for age, gender, handedness, and IQ were evaluated using a
      block design VEM paradigm that manipulated semantically related and unrelated
      words. RESULTS: The semantic clustering strategy score (SCS) predicted VEM
      performance in HC (p < .001, R(2) = 0.635), but not in patients (p = .099).
      Children with OCD also presented hypoactivation in the dorsomedial prefrontal
      cortex (cluster-corrected p < .001). Within-group analysis revealed a negative
      correlation between Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores and activation
      of orbitofrontal cortex in the group with OCD. Finally, a positive correlation
      between age and SCS was found in HC (p = .001, r = 0.635), but not in patients
      with OCD (p = .936, r = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Children with OCD presented altered
      brain activation during the VEM paradigm and absence of expected correlation
      between SCS and age, and between SCS and total words recalled. These results
      suggest that different neural mechanisms underlie self-initiated semantic
      clustering in OCD.

TI  - Coding complexity in the human motor circuit.
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23000 [doi]
AB  - Cortical oscillatory dynamics are known to be critical for human movement,
      although their functional significance remains unclear. In particular, there is a
      strong beta (15-30 Hz) desynchronization that begins before movement onset and
      continues during movement, before rebounding after movement termination. Several 
      studies have connected this response to motor planning and/or movement selection 
      operations, but to date such studies have examined only the early aspects of the 
      response (i.e., before movement) and a limited number of parameters. In this
      study, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and a novel motor sequence paradigm
      to probe how motor plan complexity modulates peri-movement beta oscillations, and
      connectivity within activated circuits. We also examined the dynamics by imaging 
      beta activity before and during movement execution and extracting virtual sensors
      from key regions. We found stronger beta desynchronization during complex
      relative to simple sequences in the right parietal and left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during movement execution. There was also an increase
      in functional connectivity between the left DLPFC and right parietal shortly
      after movement onset during complex but not simple sequences, which produced a
      significant conditional effect (i.e., complex > simple) that was not attributable
      to differences in response amplitude. This study is the first to demonstrate that
      complexity modulates the dynamics of the peri-movement beta ERD, which provides
      crucial new data on the functional role of this well-known oscillatory motor
      response. These data further suggest that execution of complex motor behavior may
      recruit key regions of the fronto-parietal network, in addition to traditional
      sensorimotor regions. Hum Brain Mapp, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Brain Correlates of Self-Evaluation Deficits in Schizophrenia: A Combined
      Functional and Structural MRI Study.
PG  - e0138737
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0138737 [doi]
AB  - Self-evaluation plays an important role in adaptive functioning and is a process 
      that is typically impaired in patients with schizophrenia. Underlying neural
      mechanisms for this dysfunction may be associated with manifested psychosis.
      However, the brain substrates underlying this deficit are not well known. The
      present study used brain blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) and gray matter voxel-based morphometry to explore the
      functional and structural brain correlates of self-evaluation deficits in
      schizophrenia. Eighteen patients with schizophrenia and 17 healthy controls were 
      recruited and asked to judge whether a set of personality-trait adjectives were
      appropriate for describing themselves, a familiar other, or whether the
      adjectives were of positive or negative valence. Patients had slower response
      times for negative trait attributions than controls did; responses to positive
      trait attributions were faster than those for negative traits among the patient
      group, while no differences were observed in the control group. Control subjects 
      showed greater activation within the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) and 
      the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) than the patient group during the
      self-evaluation > semantic positivity-evaluation contrast. Patients showed
      greater activation mainly within the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC) as compared 
      to controls for the other-evaluation > semantic positivity-evaluation contrast.
      Furthermore, gray matter volume was reduced in the MPFC, temporal lobe, cuneus,
      and the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) among the patient group when
      compared to controls. The present study adds to previous findings regarding self-
      and other-referential processing in schizophrenia, providing support for
      neurobiological models of self-reflection impairment.

      brain.
PG  - 1364-75
LID - 10.1038/nn.4115 [doi]
AB  - The fact that exposure to severe stress leads to the development of psychiatric
      disorders serves as the basic rationale for animal models of stress disorders.
      Clinical and neuroimaging studies have shown that three brain areas involved in
      learning and memory-the hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex-undergo
      distinct structural and functional changes in individuals with stress disorders. 
      These findings from patient studies pose several challenges for animal models of 
      stress disorders. For instance, why does stress impair cognitive function, yet
      enhance fear and anxiety? Can the same stressful experience elicit contrasting
      patterns of plasticity in the hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex? How
      does even a brief exposure to traumatic stress lead to long-lasting behavioral
      abnormalities? Thus, animal models of stress disorders must not only capture the 
      unique spatio-temporal features of structural and functional alterations in these
      brain areas, but must also provide insights into the underlying neuronal
      plasticity mechanisms. This Review will address some of these key questions by
      describing findings from animal models on how stress-induced plasticity varies
      across different brain regions and thereby gives rise to the debilitating
      emotional and cognitive symptoms of stress-related psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Action observation and imitation in autism spectrum disorders: an ALE
      meta-analysis of fMRI studies.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that the mirror neuron system (MNS) plays an
      important role in action understanding. However, whether and how the MNS activity
      is different in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and typically
      developed (TD) individuals are still unclear. The current study used activation
      likelihood estimation to conduct a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance
      imaging studies that investigated action observation and imitation in ASD and TD 
      individuals. Thirteen studies were selected, and the contrasts focused on the
      brain effects in ASD and TD participants and the differences between the two
      groups. The results showed that compared with TD individuals, ASD individuals
      exhibited stronger effects in the anterior inferior parietal lobule, a part of
      the putative human MNS. In addition, the ASD group demonstrated altered effects
      in the occipital cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and
      insula. These results suggest that ASD individuals demonstrate dysfunction of the
      MNS during action observation and imitation. Furthermore, brain regions involved 
      in visual processing, executive function, and social cognitive function might
      also show dysfunction during action task performance.

TI  - Abnormal regional homogeneity in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A
      resting-state functional MRI study.
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12692 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Task-related brain imaging research has implicated abnormal central
      processing of visceral sensation in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, how 
      brain function of IBS patients is altered during resting-state remains to be
      determined. We investigated spontaneous brain activity of patients with IBS using
      regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis in resting-state functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). METHODS: Thirty-one patients with
      diarrhea-predominant IBS and 32 age- and sex- matched healthy controls underwent 
      clinical assessments and rs-fMRI scanning. ReHo maps were acquired by calculating
      the Kendall's coefficient of concordance and compared between the IBS group and
      the control group. The effects of psychological disturbance on group differences 
      were assessed by including anxiety and depression levels as covariates in the
      statistical analyses. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the 
      relationship between ReHo values and disease duration, symptom severity, and pain
      intensity. KEY RESULTS: Compared with controls, IBS patients showed increased
      ReHo in the postcentral gyrus and thalamus and decreased ReHo in the anterior
      cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex. The inclusion of anxiety and depression
      as covariates did not alter ReHo differences between the two groups. Furthermore,
      significant correlations were found between clinical indices and ReHo values in
      some brain regions in the IBS group. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: IBS patients have 
      abnormal local synchronization of spontaneous brain activity in regions involved 
      in visceral afferent processing, emotional arousal, and cognitive modulation.
      Combining rs-fMRI and ReHo analysis seems to be a valuable approach to
      investigate the neural basis of IBS.

LID - S1878-9293(15)00089-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.dcn.2015.09.003 [doi]
AB  - This work investigated the impact of heavy marijuana use during adolescence on
      emotional functioning, as well as the brain functional mediators of this effect. 
      Participants (n=40) were recruited from the Michigan Longitudinal Study (MLS).
      Data on marijuana use were collected prospectively beginning in childhood as part
      of the MLS. Participants were classified as heavy marijuana users (n=20) or
      controls with minimal marijuana use. Two facets of emotional functioning-negative
      emotionality and resiliency (a self-regulatory mechanism)-were assessed as part
      of the MLS at three time points: mean age 13.4, mean age 19.6, and mean age 23.1.
      Functional neuroimaging data during an emotion-arousal word task were collected
      at mean age 20.2. Negative emotionality decreased and resiliency increased across
      the three time points in controls but not heavy marijuana users. Compared with
      controls, heavy marijuana users had less activation to negative words in
      temporal, prefrontal, and occipital cortices, insula, and amygdala. Activation of
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to negative words mediated an association between 
      marijuana group and later negative emotionality. Activation of the cuneus/lingual
      gyrus mediated an association between marijuana group and later resiliency.
      Results support growing evidence that heavy marijuana use during adolescence
      affects later emotional outcomes.

TI  - Cognitive Function Related to the Sirh11/Zcchc16 Gene Acquired from an LTR
      Retrotransposon in Eutherians.
PG  - e1005521
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005521 [doi]
AB  - Gene targeting of mouse Sushi-ichi-related retrotransposon homologue 11/Zinc
      finger CCHC domain-containing 16 (Sirh11/Zcchc16) causes abnormal behaviors
      related to cognition, including attention, impulsivity and working memory.
      Sirh11/Zcchc16 encodes a CCHC type of zinc-finger protein that exhibits high
      homology to an LTR retrotransposon Gag protein. Upon microdialysis analysis of
      the prefrontal cortex region, the recovery rate of noradrenaline (NA) was reduced
      compared with dopamine (DA) after perfusion of high potassium-containing
      artificial cerebrospinal fluid in knockout (KO) mice. These data indicate that
      Sirh11/Zcchc16 is involved in cognitive function in the brain, possibly via the
      noradrenergic system, in the contemporary mouse developmental systems.
      Interestingly, it is highly conserved in three out of the four major groups of
      the eutherians, euarchontoglires, laurasiatheria and afrotheria, but is heavily
      mutated in xenarthran species such as the sloth and armadillo, suggesting that it
      has contributed to brain evolution in the three major eutherian lineages,
      including humans and mice. Sirh11/Zcchc16 is the first SIRH gene to be involved
      in brain function, instead of just the placenta, as seen in the case of Peg10,
      Peg11/Rtl1 and Sirh7/Ldoc1.

TI  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation as an Alternative Therapy for
      Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease: A Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 463-72
LID - 10.3233/JAD-150346 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have indicated that repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) could improve cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). Yet the results are inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis
      aimed to evaluate recent rTMS studies conducted in mild to moderate AD patients. 
      METHODS: PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE databases and Science Direct were searched for
      studies of rTMS treatment on AD patients with cognitive impairment published
      before February 2015. The relevant primary outcomes of cognition were extracted
      from those included studies. A crude standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) was calculated by using random effect models. RESULTS:
      Seven studies with a total of 94 mild to moderate AD patients were included in
      this meta-analysis. A significant overall rTMS treatment effect on cognition was 
      found for all AD patients (p = 0.0008, SMD = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.41-1.58).
      Stratification analysis showed that this effect is stimulation frequency- and
      hemisphere-dependent. High frequency stimulation (>1.0 Hz) (p < 0.05) but not low
      frequency stimulation (</=1.0 Hz) (p > 0.05) was significantly effective in
      improving the cognition of AD patients. Further, rTMS stimulation on right
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral DLPFC (p < 0.05), but not on
      the left DLPFC (p > 0.05) was significantly effective in improving cognitive
      function of AD patients. A significant effect was observed in the rTMS subgroup
      (p < 0.05), rather than in the rTMS+drug subgroup (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This
      meta-analysis supports that high frequency rTMS stimulation on right- or
      bilateral-DLPFC has significant therapeutic effect on cognitive function in
      patients with mild to moderate AD. Due to small number of studies included, more 
      well-controlled rTMS studies should be evaluated in AD patients in the future.

TI  - Decoding Episodic Retrieval Processes: Frontoparietal and Medial-temporal Lobe
      Contributions to Free Recall.
PG  - 1-15
AB  - Neuroimaging studies of recognition memory have identified distinct patterns of
      cortical activity associated with two sets of cognitive processes: Recollective
      processes supporting retrieval of information specifying a probe item's original 
      source are associated with the posterior hippocampus, ventral posterior parietal 
      cortex, and medial pFC. Familiarity processes supporting the correct
      identification of previously studied probes (in the absence of a recollective
      response) are associated with activity in anterior medial-temporal lobe (MTL)
      structures including the perirhinal cortex and anterior hippocampus, in addition 
      to lateral prefrontal and dorsal posterior parietal cortex. Here, we address an
      open question in the cognitive neuroscientific literature: To what extent are
      these same neurocognitive processes engaged during an internally directed memory 
      search task like free recall? We recorded fMRI activity while participants
      performed a series of free recall and source recognition trials, and we used a
      combination of univariate and multivariate analysis techniques to compare neural 
      activation profiles across the two tasks. Univariate analyses showed that
      posterior MTL regions were commonly associated with recollective processes during
      source recognition and with free recall responses. Prefrontal and posterior
      parietal regions were commonly associated with familiarity processes and free
      recall responses, whereas anterior MTL regions were only associated with
      familiarity processes during recognition. In contrast with the univariate
      results, free recall activity patterns characterized using multivariate pattern
      analysis did not reliably match the neural patterns associated with recollective 
      processes. However, these free recall patterns did reliably match patterns
      associated with familiarity processes, supporting theories of memory in which
      common cognitive mechanisms support both item recognition and free recall.

      and Cortical Amyloid Deposition.
PG  - 661-7
LID - 10.3233/JAD-141965 [doi]
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal disease of unknown origin, affects
      motor neurons in the primary motor cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Cognitive 
      impairment may occur before the motor symptoms. We present a patient who was
      initially diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) but who developed ALS-like symptoms during follow-up and died
      shortly thereafter. A 60-year-old subject with cognitive impairment underwent
      neuropsychological testing, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, structural
      imaging (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) and functional
      imaging [11C]-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET),
      [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, and [11C]-deuterium-L-deprenyl (DED) PET.
      Neuropsychological testing showed episodic memory impairment. CSF P-tau and T-tau
      levels were elevated. CSF amyloid-beta (Abeta)42 levels were initially normal but
      became pathological during follow-up. MCI was diagnosed. [18F]-FDG PET showed
      hypometabolism in the left temporal and prefrontal cortices and [11C]-PIB PET
      demonstrated amyloid plaque deposition in the prefrontal, posterior cingulate,
      and parietal cortices. [11C]-DED PET showed high brain accumulation consistent
      with astrocytosis. The memory impairment progressed and AD was diagnosed. Motor
      impairments developed subsequently and, following additional neurological
      evaluation, ALS was diagnosed. The disease progressed rapidly and the patient
      died with pronounced motor symptoms three years after the initial cognitive
      assessment. Since relatives refused autopsy, postmortem analysis was not
      possible.

TI  - Enhancement of Working Memory and Task-Related Oscillatory Activity Following
      Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation in Healthy Controls.
LID - bhv193 [pii]
AB  - Noninvasive brain stimulation is increasingly being investigated for the
      enhancement of cognition, yet current approaches appear to be limited in their
      degree and duration of effects. The majority of studies to date have delivered
      stimulation in "standard" ways (i.e., anodal transcranial direct current
      stimulation or high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation). Specialized
      forms of stimulation, such as theta burst stimulation (TBS), which more closely
      mimic the brains natural firing patterns may have greater effects on cognitive
      performance. We report here the findings from the first-ever investigation into
      the persistent cognitive and electrophysiological effects of intermittent TBS
      (iTBS) delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In 19 healthy
      controls, active iTBS significantly improved performance on an assessment of
      working memory when compared with sham stimulation across a period of 40 min post
      stimulation. The behavioral findings were accompanied by increases in
      task-related fronto-parietal theta sychronization and parietal gamma band power. 
      These results have implications for the role of more specialized stimulation
      approaches in neuromodulation.

TI  - Individual Differences in Adult Reading Are Associated with Left Temporo-parietal
      to Dorsal Striatal Functional Connectivity.
LID - bhv214 [pii]
AB  - Reading skills vary widely in both children and adults, with a number of factors 
      contributing to this variability. The most prominent factor may be related to
      efficiency of storage, representation, or retrieval of speech sounds. This
      phonological hypothesis is supported by findings of reduced activation in poor
      readers in left hemisphere ventro-lateral prefrontal and temporo-parietal
      phonological processing regions. Less well explained by phonological theories are
      reported hyperactivation in prefrontal, striatal, and insular regions. This study
      investigated functional connectivity of a core phonological processing region,
      the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), in relation to reading skill in an adult
      community sample. We hypothesized that connectivity between TPJ and regions
      implicated in meta-analyses of reading disorder would correlate with individual
      differences in reading. Forty-four adults aged 30-54, ranging in reading ability,
      underwent resting fMRI scans. Data-driven connectivity clustering was used to
      identify TPJ subregions for seed-based connectivity analyses. Correlations were
      assessed between TPJ connectivity and timed-pseudoword reading (decoding)
      ability. We found a significant correlation wherein greater left supramarginal
      gyrus to anterior caudate connectivity was associated with weaker decoding. This 
      suggests that hyperactivation of the dorsal striatum, reported in poor readers
      during reading tasks, may reflect compensatory or inefficient overintegration
      into attention networks.

TI  - The neural basis of trait self-esteem revealed by the amplitude of low-frequency 
      fluctuations and resting state functional connectivity.
LID - nsv119 [pii]
AB  - Self-esteem is an affective, self-evaluation of oneself and has a significant
      effect on mental and behavioral health. Although research has focused on the
      neural substrates of self-esteem, little is known about the spontaneous brain
      activity that is associated with trait self-esteem (TSE) during the resting
      state. In this study, we used the resting-state functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) signal of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and 
      resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) to identify TSE-related regions and 
      networks. We found that a higher level of TSE was associated with higher ALFFs in
      the left ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and lower ALFFs in the left
      cuneus/lingual gyrus and right lingual gyrus. RSFC analyses revealed that the
      strengths of functional connectivity between the left vmPFC and bilateral
      hippocampus were positively correlated with TSE; however, the connections between
      the left vmPFC and right inferior frontal gyrus and posterior superior temporal
      sulcus were negatively associated with TSE. Furthermore, the strengths of
      functional connectivity between the left cuneus/lingual gyrus and right
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex were positively
      related to TSE. These findings indicate that TSE is linked to core regions in the
      default mode network and social cognition network, which is involved in
      self-referential processing, autobiographical memory and social cognition.

TI  - Functional brain imaging predicts public health campaign success.
LID - nsv108 [pii]
AB  - Mass media can powerfully affect health decision-making. Pretesting through focus
      groups or surveys is a standard, though inconsistent predictor of effectiveness. 
      Converging evidence demonstrates that activity within brain systems associated
      with self-related processing can predict individual behavior in response to
      health messages. Preliminary evidence also suggests that neural activity in small
      groups can forecast population level campaign outcomes. Less is known about the
      psychological processes that link neural activity and population level outcomes, 
      or how these predictions are affected by message content. We exposed 50 smokers
      to anti-smoking messages and used their aggregated neural activity within a
      'self-localizer' defined region of medial prefrontal cortex to predict the
      success of the same campaign messages at the population level (n=400,000 emails).
      Results demonstrate that: 1) independently-localized neural activity during
      health message exposure complements existing self-report data in predicting
      population level campaign responses (model combined R2 up to .65) and 2) this
      relationship depends on message content-self-related neural processing predicts
      outcomes in response to strong negative arguments against smoking and not in
      response to compositionally similar neutral images. These data advance
      understanding of the psychological link between brain and large-scale behavior
      and may aid the construction of more effective media health campaigns.

TI  - When your error becomes my error: anterior insula activation in response to
      observed errors is modulated by agency.
LID - nsv120 [pii]
AB  - Research on error observation has focused predominantly on situations in which
      individuals are passive observers of errors. In daily life, however, we are often
      jointly responsible for the mistakes of others. In the current study, we examined
      how information on agency is integrated in the error observation network. It was 
      found that activation in the anterior insula but not in the posterior medial
      frontal cortex or lateral prefrontal cortex differentiates between observed
      errors for which we are partly responsible or not. Interestingly, the activation 
      pattern of the AI was mirrored by feelings of guilt and shame. These results
      suggest that the anterior insula is crucially involved in evaluating the
      consequences of our actions for other persons. Consequently, this region may be
      thought of as critical in guiding social behavior.

AB  - Emotions are considered to modulate action readiness. Previous studies have
      demonstrated increased force production following exposure to emotionally
      arousing visual stimuli; however the neural mechanisms underlying how precise
      force output is controlled within varying emotional contexts remain poorly
      understood. To identify the neural correlates of emotion-modulated motor
      behaviour, twenty-two participants produced a submaximal isometric precision-grip
      contraction while viewing pleasant, unpleasant, neutral or blank images (without 
      visual feedback of force output). Force magnitude was continuously recorded
      together with change in brain activity using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging. Viewing unpleasant images resulted in reduced force decay during force
      maintenance as compared with pleasant, neutral and blank images. Subjective
      valence and arousal ratings significantly predicted force production during
      maintenance. Neuroimaging revealed that negative valence and its interaction with
      force output correlated with increased activity in right inferior frontal gyrus
      (rIFG), while arousal was associated with amygdala and periaqueductal gray (PAG) 
      activation. Force maintenance alone was correlated with cerebellar activity.
      These data demonstrate a valence-driven modulation of force output, mediated by a
      cortico-subcortical network involving rIFG and PAG. These findings are consistent
      with engagement of motor pathways associated with aversive motivation, eliciting 
      defensive behaviour and action preparedness in response to negative emotional
      signals.

TI  - Prefrontal lobe structural integrity and trail making test, part B: converging
      findings from surface-based cortical thickness and voxel-based lesion symptom
      analyses.
AB  - Surface-based cortical thickness (CT) analyses are increasingly being used to
      investigate variations in brain morphology across the spectrum of brain health,
      from neurotypical to neuropathological. An outstanding question is whether
      individual differences in cortical morphology, such as regionally increased or
      decreased CT, are associated with domain-specific performance deficits in healthy
      adults. Since CT studies are correlational, they cannot establish causality
      between brain morphology and cognitive performance. A direct comparison with
      classic lesion methods is needed to determine whether the regional specificity of
      CT-cognition correlations is similar to that observed in patients with brain
      lesions. We address this question by comparing the neuroanatomical overlap of
      effects when 1) whole brain vertex-wise CT is tested as a correlate of
      performance variability on a commonly used neuropsychological test of executive
      function, Trailmaking Test Part B (TMT-B), in healthy adults and 2) voxel-based
      lesion-symptom mapping (VBLSM) is used to map lesion location to performance
      decrements on the same task in patients with frontal lobe lesions. We found that 
      reduced performance on the TMT-B was associated with increased CT in bilateral
      prefrontal regions in healthy adults and that results spatially overlapped in the
      left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex with findings from the VBLSM analysis in
      patients with frontal brain lesions. Findings indicate that variations in the
      structural integrity of the left dorsomedial prefrontal lobe, ranging from
      individual CT differences in healthy adults to structural lesions in patients
      with neurological disorders, are associated with poor performance on the TMT-B.
      These converging results suggest that the left dorsomedial prefrontal region
      houses a critical region for the complex processing demands of TMT-B, which
      include visuomotor tracking, sequencing, and cognitive flexibility.

AB  - Deficits in reward anticipation are putative mechanisms for multiple
      psychopathologies. Research indicates that these deficits are characterized by
      reduced left (relative to right) frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and 
      blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal abnormalities in mesolimbic and
      prefrontal neural regions during reward anticipation. Although it is often
      assumed that these two measures capture similar mechanisms, no study to our
      knowledge has directly examined the convergence between frontal EEG alpha
      asymmetry and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during reward
      anticipation in the same sample. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to
      investigate if and where in the brain frontal EEG alpha asymmetry and fMRI
      measures were correlated in a sample of 40 adults. All participants completed two
      analogous reward anticipation tasks-once during EEG data collection and the other
      during fMRI data collection. Results indicated that the two measures do converge 
      and that during reward anticipation, increased relative left frontal activity is 
      associated with increased left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)/medial prefrontal 
      cortex (mPFC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activation. This suggests that 
      the two measures may similarly capture PFC functioning, which is noteworthy given
      the role of these regions in reward processing and the pathophysiology of
      disorders such as depression and schizophrenia.

TI  - The effects of catastrophizing on central motor activity.
LID - 10.1002/ejp.781 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain catastrophizing significantly affects an individual's experience
      of pain. High pain catastrophizing is associated with increased fear avoidance
      behaviours, pain intensity and disability. The aim of this investigation was to
      determine the effect of pain catastrophizing on ongoing brain activity and
      movement-evoked brain activity during acute orofacial muscle pain. METHODS:
      Thirty-four healthy, pain-free subjects were recruited. In 17 subjects, the
      effect of catastrophizing on regional brain activity was determined. In 19
      subjects, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine the effects
      of pain catastrophizing on brain activation patterns during jaw movements in the 
      presence of ongoing pain. RESULTS: We found that in the presence of pain,
      catastrophizing was significantly correlated with activity in multi-sensory
      integrative brain regions, including the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal
      cortices. Importantly, this relationship did not exist when subjects were not
      experiencing pain. In addition, during repetitive open-close jaw movements in the
      presence of pain, activity in the primary motor cortex, cerebellar cortex and the
      trigeminal motor nucleus was positively correlated with pain catastrophizing
      scores. In contrast, in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as pain
      catastrophizing scores increased, the magnitude of signal intensity change during
      jaw movements decreased. Again, no such relationships occurred when the
      individual was not in pain. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that during pain,
      catastrophic thinking has a significant impact on activity in motor and sensory
      integrative regions. Reducing negative coping strategies may be an effective
      means in reducing fear avoidance behaviours and the intensity of ongoing pain.

AB  - The loss of an only child is a negative life event and may potentially increase
      the risk of psychiatric disorders. However, the psychological consequences of the
      loss of an only child and the associated neural mechanisms remain largely
      unexplored. Degree centrality (DC), derived from resting-state functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), was used to examine network communication in
      22 older adults who lost their only child and 23 matched controls. The older
      adults who lost their only child exhibited an ineffective coping style. They also
      showed decreased distant and local DC in the precuneus and left inferior parietal
      lobule and decreased distant DC in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC). Furthermore, the decreased local and distant DC of these regions and the
      decreased DLPFC-precuneus connectivity strength were negatively correlated with
      negative coping scores in the loss group but not in the controls. Overall, the
      results suggested a model that the impaired neural network communication of brain
      hubs within the default mode network (DMN) and central executive network (CEN)
      were associated with a negative coping style in older adults who lost their only 
      child. The decreased connectivity of the hubs can be identified as a neural risk 
      factor that is related to future psychopathology.

AB  - Visual perceptual learning has been shown to be highly specific to the
      retinotopic location and attributes of the trained stimulus. Recent
      psychophysical studies suggest that these specificities, which have been
      associated with early retinotopic visual cortex, may in fact not be inherent in
      perceptual learning and could be related to higher-order brain functions. Here we
      provide direct electrophysiological evidence in support of this proposition. In a
      series of event-related potential (ERP) experiments, we recorded high-density
      electroencephalography (EEG) from human adults over the course of learning in a
      texture discrimination task (TDT). The results consistently showed that the
      earliest C1 component (68-84ms), known to reflect V1 activity driven by
      feedforward inputs, was not modulated by learning regardless of whether the
      behavioral improvement is location specific or not. In contrast, two later
      posterior ERP components (posterior P1 and P160-350) over the occipital cortex
      and one anterior ERP component (anterior P160-350) over the prefrontal cortex
      were progressively modified day by day. Moreover, the change of the anterior
      component was closely correlated with improved behavioral performance on a daily 
      basis. Consistent with recent psychophysical and imaging observations, our
      results indicate that perceptual learning can mainly involve changes in
      higher-level visual cortex as well as in the neural networks responsible for
      cognitive functions such as attention and decision making.

AB  - While our understanding of cerebellar structural development through adolescence 
      and young adulthood has expanded, we still lack knowledge of the developmental
      patterns of cerebellar networks during this critical portion of the lifespan.
      Volume in lateral posterior cerebellar regions associated with cognition and the 
      prefrontal cortex develops more slowly, reaching their peak volume in adulthood, 
      particularly as compared to motor Lobule V. We predicted that resting state
      functional connectivity of the lateral posterior regions would show a similar
      pattern of development during adolescence and young adulthood. That is, we
      expected to see changes over time in Crus I and Crus II connectivity with the
      cortex, but no changes in Lobule V connectivity. Additionally, we were interested
      in how structural connectivity changes in cerebello-thalamo-cortical white matter
      are related to changes in functional connectivity. A sample of 23 individuals
      between 12 and 21years old underwent neuroimaging scans at baseline and 12months 
      later. Functional networks of Crus I and Crus II showed significant connectivity 
      decreases over 12months, though there were no differences in Lobule V.
      Furthermore, these functional connectivity changes were correlated with increases
      in white matter structural integrity in the corresponding
      cerebello-thalamo-cortical white matter tract. We suggest that these functional
      network changes are due to both later pruning in the prefrontal cortex as well as
      further development of the white matter tracts linking these brain regions.

TI  - Forebrain neurocircuitry associated with human reflex cardiovascular control.
PG  - 240
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2015.00240 [doi]
AB  - Physiological homeostasis depends upon adequate integration and responsiveness of
      sensory information with the autonomic nervous system to affect rapid and
      effective adjustments in end organ control. Dysregulation of the autonomic
      nervous system leads to cardiovascular disability with consequences as severe as 
      sudden death. The neural pathways involved in reflexive autonomic control are
      dependent upon brainstem nuclei but these receive modulatory inputs from higher
      centers in the midbrain and cortex. Neuroimaging technologies have allowed closer
      study of the cortical circuitry related to autonomic cardiovascular adjustments
      to many stressors in awake humans and have exposed many forebrain sites that
      associate strongly with cardiovascular arousal during stress including the medial
      prefrontal cortex, insula cortex, anterior cingulate, amygdala and hippocampus.
      Using a comparative approach, this review will consider the cortical autonomic
      circuitry in rodents and primates with a major emphasis on more recent
      neuroimaging studies in awake humans. A challenge with neuroimaging studies is
      their interpretation in view of multiple sensory, perceptual, emotive and/or
      reflexive components of autonomic responses. This review will focus on those
      responses related to non-volitional baroreflex control of blood pressure and also
      on the coordinated responses to non-fatiguing, non-painful volitional exercise
      with particular emphasis on the medial prefrontal cortex and the insula cortex.

AB  - Performing a task alone or together with another agent can produce different
      outcomes. The current study used event-related functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural underpinnings when participants
      performed a Go/Nogo task alone or complementarily with another co-actor (unseen),
      whom was believed to be another human or a computer. During both complementary
      tasks, reaction time data suggested that participants integrated the potential
      action of their co-actor in their own action planning. Compared to the
      single-actor task, increased parietal and precentral activity during
      complementary tasks as shown in the fMRI data further suggested representation of
      the co-actor's response. The superior frontal gyrus of the medial prefrontal
      cortex was differentially activated in the human co-actor condition compared to
      the computer co-actor condition. The medial prefrontal cortex, involved thinking 
      about the beliefs and intentions of other people, possibly reflects a
      social-cognitive aspect or self-other discrimination during the joint task when
      believing a biological co-actor is present. Our results suggest that action
      co-representation can occur even o ffl ine with any agent type given a priori
      information that they are co-acting; however, additional regions are recruited
      when participants believe they are task-sharing with another human.

      predictive for subsequent retrieval.
PG  - 479
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00479 [doi]
AB  - Performance on working memory (WM) tasks may partially be supported by long-term 
      memory (LTM) processing. Hence, brain activation recently being implicated in WM 
      may actually have been driven by (incidental) LTM formation. We examined which
      brain regions actually support successful WM processing, rather than being
      confounded by LTM processes, during the maintenance and probe phase of a WM task.
      We administered a four-pair (faces and houses) associative
      delayed-match-to-sample (WM) task using event-related functional MRI (fMRI) and a
      subsequent associative recognition LTM task, using the same stimuli. This enabled
      us to analyze subsequent memory effects for both the WM and the LTM test by
      contrasting correctly recognized pairs with incorrect pairs for either task.
      Critically, with respect to the subsequent WM effect, we computed this analysis
      exclusively for trials that were forgotten in the subsequent LTM recognition
      task. Hence, brain activity associated with successful WM processing was less
      likely to be confounded by incidental LTM formation. The subsequent LTM effect,
      in contrast, was analyzed exclusively for pairs that previously had been
      correctly recognized in the WM task, disclosing brain regions involved in
      successful LTM formation after successful WM processing. Results for the
      subsequent WM effect showed no significantly activated brain areas for WM
      maintenance, possibly due to an insensitivity of fMRI to mechanisms underlying
      active WM maintenance. In contrast, a correct decision at WM probe was linked to 
      activation in the "retrieval success network" (anterior and posterior midline
      brain structures). The subsequent LTM analyses revealed greater activation in
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex in the early
      phase of the maintenance stage. No supra-threshold activation was found during
      the WM probe. Together, we obtained clearer insights in which brain regions
      support successful WM and LTM without the potential confound of the respective
      memory system.

AB  - Recent imaging connectomics studies have demonstrated that the spontaneous human 
      brain functional networks derived from resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI)
      include many non-trivial topological properties, such as highly efficient
      small-world architecture and densely connected hub regions. However, very little 
      is known about dynamic functional connectivity (D-FC) patterns of spontaneous
      human brain networks during rest and about how these spontaneous brain dynamics
      are constrained by the underlying structural connectivity. Here, we combined
      sub-second multiband R-fMRI data with graph-theoretical approaches to
      comprehensively investigate the dynamic characteristics of the topological
      organization of human whole-brain functional networks, and then employed
      diffusion imaging data in the same participants to further explore the associated
      structural substrates. At the connection level, we found that human whole-brain
      D-FC patterns spontaneously fluctuated over time, while homotopic D-FC exhibited 
      high connectivity strength and low temporal variability. At the network level,
      dynamic functional networks exhibited time-varying but evident small-world and
      assortativity architecture, with several regions (e.g., insula, sensorimotor
      cortex and medial prefrontal cortex) emerging as functionally persistent hubs
      (i.e., highly connected regions) while possessing large temporal variability in
      their degree centrality. Finally, the temporal characteristics (i.e., strength
      and variability) of the connectional and nodal properties of the dynamic brain
      networks were significantly associated with their structural counterparts.
      Collectively, we demonstrate the economical, efficient, and flexible
      characteristics of dynamic functional coordination in large-scale human brain
      networks during rest, and highlight their relationship with underlying structural
      connectivity, which deepens our understandings of spontaneous brain network
      dynamics in humans.

      between three core brain networks.

LID - 10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00244 [doi]
AB  - Working memory (WM) refers to the temporary holding and manipulation of
      information during the performance of a range of cognitive tasks, and WM training
      is a promising method for improving an individual's cognitive functions. Our
      previous work demonstrated that WM performance can be improved through
      self-regulation of dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation using
      real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI), which enables
      individuals to control local brain activities volitionally according to the
      neurofeedback. Furthermore, research concerning large-scale brain networks has
      demonstrated that WM training requires the engagement of several networks,
      including the central executive network (CEN), the default mode network (DMN) and
      the salience network (SN), and functional connectivity within the CEN and DMN can
      be changed by WM training. Although a switching role of the SN between the CEN
      and DMN has been demonstrated, it remains unclear whether WM training can affect 
      the interactions between the three networks and whether a similar mechanism also 
      exists during the training process. In this study, we investigated the dynamic
      functional connectivity between the three networks during the rtfMRI feedback
      training using independent component analysis (ICA) and correlation analysis. The
      results indicated that functional connectivity within and between the three
      networks were significantly enhanced by feedback training, and most of the
      changes were associated with the insula and correlated with behavioral
      improvements. These findings suggest that the insula plays a critical role in the
      reorganization of functional connectivity among the three networks induced by
      rtfMRI training and in WM performance, thus providing new insights into the
      mechanisms of high-level functions and the clinical treatment of related
      functional impairments.

TI  - Reduced prefrontal oxygenation in mild cognitive impairment during memory
      retrieval.
LID - 10.1002/gps.4363 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Memory impairment is considered a hallmark of amnestic mild cognitive
      impairment (aMCI) and dementia. Emerging evidence suggests that the prefrontal
      lobe is required to maintain memory functions. The purpose of this study was to
      clarify whether older adults with aMCI have decreased prefrontal oxygenation
      during memory encoding and retrieval compared with age-matched healthy older
      adults, using multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy. METHODS: We examined 64
      older adults with aMCI (mean 71.8 years) and 66 cognitively healthy control
      subjects comparable in age and gender (mean 71.7 years). The concentration of
      oxy-hemoglobin, which is a reliable biomarker of changes in regional cerebral
      blood flow, was measured in the prefrontal cortex during encoding and delayed
      retrieval of a list of 10 target words. Task performance was evaluated as average
      number of correct answers in the retrieval task. RESULTS: Subjects with aMCI
      showed reduced activation in the bilateral dorsolateral cortex (approximately
      Brodmann area 9) and provided fewer correct answers in the retrieval period than 
      control subjects. There were no significant differences during encoding.
      CONCLUSIONS: Reduced activation in the dorsolateral cortex during retrieval may
      cause deficits in memory performance, which may be used as a marker of aMCI.
      Further studies are required to examine the predictive validity of this decreased
      activation pattern for the incidence of Alzheimer's disease. Copyright (c) 2015

TI  - Brain Activation Associated with Automatic Processing of Alcohol-Related Cues in 
      Young Heavy Drinkers and Its Modulation by Alcohol Administration.
PG  - 1957-66
LID - 10.1111/acer.12835 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the automatic processing of alcohol-related cues by alcohol
      abusers is well established in experimental psychopathology approaches, the
      cerebral regions involved in this phenomenon and the influence of alcohol intake 
      on this process remain unknown. The aim of this functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) study was to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the
      processing of task-irrelevant alcohol-related stimuli in young heavy drinkers and
      their modulation by alcohol administration. METHODS: Twelve heavy drinking male
      participants were scanned on 2 separate days; once after a low dose of alcohol
      intake (0.4 g/kg), and once after a placebo intake, in balanced order. Images of 
      alcoholic drinks, soft drinks, or neutral objects were shown while participants' 
      neural activity was recorded through fMRI. Moreover, participants' attentional
      focus was manipulated using a task which required them to process the central
      images of interest (focus alcohol condition) or a center unattended task (focus
      not on alcohol condition). RESULTS: Results indicated that an explicit judgment
      on beverage-related cues increased activation in the prefrontal area compared
      with the judgment of neutral objects. By comparison with that of task-irrelevant 
      neutral cues, the processing of task-irrelevant alcohol-related cues increased
      the activation in a large network of cerebral areas including visual and temporal
      regions, the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex,
      and the putamen. Moreover, in the condition with focus not on alcohol, the
      ventral tegmental area (VTA) was particularly activated by the presentation of
      (task-irrelevant) alcohol-related cues compared to task-irrelevant
      soft-drink-related cues. CONCLUSIONS: The VTA was especially involved in the
      automatic processing of alcohol-related cues in young heavy drinkers. Low dose of
      alcohol did not modulate the neural substrates involved in the processing of
      salient alcohol-related cues.

AB  - The attachment and the caregiving system are complementary systems which are
      active simultaneously in infant and mother interactions. This ensures the infant 
      survival and optimal social, emotional, and cognitive development. In this brief 
      review we first define the characteristics of these two behavioral systems and
      the theory that links them, according to what Bowlby called the
      "attachment-caregiving social bond" (Bowlby, 1969). We then follow with those
      neuroimaging studies that have focused on this particular issue, i.e., those
      which have studied the activation of the careging system in women (using infant
      stimuli) and have explored how the individual attachment model (through the Adult
      Attachment Interview) modulates its activity. Studies report altered activation
      in limbic and prefrontal areas and in basal ganglia and hypothalamus/pituitary
      regions. These altered activations are thought to be the neural substrate of the 
      attachment-caregiving systems interaction.

AB  - Personality disorder symptomatology (PD-Sx) can result in personal distress and
      impaired interpersonal functioning, even in the absence of a clinical diagnosis, 
      and is frequently comorbid with psychiatric disorders such as substance use,
      mood, and anxiety disorders; however, they often remain untreated, and are not
      taken into account in clinical studies. To investigate brain morphological
      correlates of PD-Sx, we measured subcortical volume and shape, and cortical
      thickness/surface area, based on structural magnetic resonance images. We
      investigated 37 subjects who reported PD-Sx exceeding DSM-IV Axis-II screening
      thresholds, and 35 age, sex, and smoking status-matched control subjects.
      Subjects reporting PD-Sx were then grouped into symptom-based clusters: N = 20
      into Cluster B (reporting Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, or Narcissistic
      PD-Sx) and N = 28 into Cluster C (reporting Obsessive-Compulsive, Avoidant, or
      Dependent PD-Sx); N = 11 subjects reported PD-Sx from both clusters, and none
      reported Cluster A (Paranoid, Schizoid, or Schizotypal) PD-Sx. Compared to
      control, Cluster C PD-Sx was associated with greater striatal surface area
      localized to the caudate tail, smaller ventral striatum volumes, and greater
      cortical thickness in right prefrontal cortex. Both Cluster B and C PD-Sx groups 
      also showed trends toward greater posterior caudate volumes and orbitofrontal
      surface area anomalies, but these findings did not survive correction for
      multiple comparisons. The results point to morphological abnormalities that could
      contribute to Cluster C PD-Sx. In addition, the observations parallel those in
      substance use disorders, pointing to the importance of considering PD-Sx when
      interpreting findings in often-comorbid psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Music therapists use guided affect regulation in the treatment of mood disorders.
      However, self-directed uses of music in affect regulation are not fully
      understood. Some uses of music may have negative effects on mental health, as can
      non-music regulation strategies, such as rumination. Psychological testing and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were used explore music listening
      strategies in relation to mental health. Participants (n = 123) were assessed for
      depression, anxiety and Neuroticism, and uses of Music in Mood Regulation (MMR). 
      Neural responses to music were measured in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in
      a subset of participants (n = 56). Discharge, using music to express negative
      emotions, related to increased anxiety and Neuroticism in all participants and
      particularly in males. Males high in Discharge showed decreased activity of mPFC 
      during music listening compared with those using less Discharge. Females high in 
      Diversion, using music to distract from negative emotions, showed more mPFC
      activity than females using less Diversion. These results suggest that the use of
      Discharge strategy can be associated with maladaptive patterns of emotional
      regulation, and may even have long-term negative effects on mental health. This
      finding has real-world applications in psychotherapy and particularly in clinical
      music therapy.

TI  - A multi-pathway hypothesis for human visual fear signaling.
PG  - 101
LID - 10.3389/fnsys.2015.00101 [doi]
AB  - A hypothesis is proposed for five visual fear signaling pathways in humans, based
      on an analysis of anatomical connectivity from primate studies and human
      functional connectvity and tractography from brain imaging studies. Earlier work 
      has identified possible subcortical and cortical fear pathways known as the "low 
      road" and "high road," which arrive at the amygdala independently. In addition to
      a subcortical pathway, we propose four cortical signaling pathways in humans
      along the visual ventral stream. All four of these traverse through the LGN to
      the visual cortex (VC) and branching off at the inferior temporal area, with one 
      projection directly to the amygdala; another traversing the orbitofrontal cortex;
      and two others passing through the parietal and then prefrontal cortex, one
      excitatory pathway via the ventral-medial area and one regulatory pathway via the
      ventral-lateral area. These pathways have progressively longer propagation
      latencies and may have progressively evolved with brain development to take
      advantage of higher-level processing. Using the anatomical path lengths and
      latency estimates for each of these five pathways, predictions are made for the
      relative processing times at selective ROIs and arrival at the amygdala, based on
      the presentation of a fear-relevant visual stimulus. Partial verification of the 
      temporal dynamics of this hypothesis might be accomplished using experimental MEG
      analysis. Possible experimental protocols are suggested.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Several neuroimaging studies have explored
      alterations of brain function in OCD patients as they performed tasks after CBT. 
      However, the effects of CBT on the neural activityin OCD during rest remain
      unknown. Therefore, we investigated changes in regional homogeneity (ReHo) in OCD
      patients before and after CBT. METHODS: Twenty-two OCD patients and 22
      well-matched healthy controls participated in the resting-state functional
      magnetic resonance imaging scans. We compared differences in ReHo between the OCD
      and control groups before treatment and investigated the changes of ReHo in 17
      OCD patients who responded to CBT. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, OCD
      patients exhibited higher ReHo in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), bilateral
      middle frontal cortex, right precuneus, left cerebellum, and vermis, as well as
      lower ReHo in the bilateral caudate, right calcarine, right posterior cingulate
      cortex, and right middle temporal cortex. Along with the clinical improvement in 
      OCD patients after CBT, we found decreased ReHo in the right OFC, bilateral
      middle frontal cortex, left cerebellum and vermis, and increased ReHo in the left
      caudate. Improvement of OCD symptoms was significantly correlated with the
      changed ReHo in the right OFC and left cerebellum. CONCLUSIONS: Although these
      findings are preliminary and need to be replicated in larger samples, they
      indicate the presence of abnormal spontaneous brain activity of the
      prefrontal-striatal-cerebellar circuit in OCD patients, and provide evidence that
      CBT can selectively modulate the spontaneous brain activity of this circuit in
      OCD patients.

TI  - Intrinsic Functional Connectivity Patterns Predict Consciousness Level and
      Recovery Outcome in Acquired Brain Injury.
PG  - 12932-46
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0415-15.2015 [doi]
AB  - For accurate diagnosis and prognostic prediction of acquired brain injury (ABI), 
      it is crucial to understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying loss of
      consciousness. However, there is no consensus on which regions and networks act
      as biomarkers for consciousness level and recovery outcome in ABI. Using
      resting-state fMRI, we assessed intrinsic functional connectivity strength (FCS) 
      of whole-brain networks in a large sample of 99 ABI patients with varying degrees
      of consciousness loss (including fully preserved consciousness state, minimally
      conscious state, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome/vegetative state, and coma)
      and 34 healthy control subjects. Consciousness level was evaluated using the
      Glasgow Coma Scale and Coma Recovery Scale-Revised on the day of fMRI scanning;
      recovery outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale 3 months after the 
      fMRI scanning. One-way ANOVA of FCS, Spearman correlation analyses between FCS
      and the consciousness level and recovery outcome, and FCS-based multivariate
      pattern analysis were performed. We found decreased FCS with loss of
      consciousness primarily distributed in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus
      (PCC/PCU), medial prefrontal cortex, and lateral parietal cortex. The FCS values 
      of these regions were significantly correlated with consciousness level and
      recovery outcome. Multivariate support vector machine discrimination analysis
      revealed that the FCS patterns predicted whether patients with unresponsive
      wakefulness syndrome/vegetative state and coma would regain consciousness with an
      accuracy of 81.25%, and the most discriminative region was the PCC/PCU. These
      findings suggest that intrinsic functional connectivity patterns of the human
      posteromedial cortex could serve as a potential indicator for consciousness level
      and recovery outcome in individuals with ABI. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Varying
      degrees of consciousness loss and recovery are commonly observed in acquired
      brain injury patients, yet the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain
      elusive. Using a large sample of patients with varying degrees of consciousness
      loss, we demonstrate that intrinsic functional connectivity strength in many
      brain regions, especially in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus,
      significantly correlated with consciousness level and recovery outcome. We
      further demonstrate that the functional connectivity pattern of these regions can
      predict patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome/vegetative state and coma
      would regain consciousness with an accuracy of 81.25%. Our study thus provides
      potentially important biomarkers of acquired brain injury in clinical diagnosis, 
      prediction of recovery outcome, and decision making for treatment strategies for 
      patients with severe loss of consciousness.

AB  - Attention deficits in Alzheimer's disease can exacerbate its other cognitive
      symptoms, yet relevant disruptions of key prefrontal circuitry are not well
      understood. Here, in the TgCRND8 mouse model of this neurological disorder, we
      demonstrate and characterize a disruption of cholinergic excitation in the major 
      corticothalamic layer of the prefrontal cortex, in which modulation by
      acetylcholine is essential for optimal attentional function. Using
      electrophysiology with concurrent multiphoton imaging, we show that layer 6
      pyramidal cells are unable to sustain cholinergic excitation to the same extent
      as their nontransgenic littermate controls, as a result of the excessive
      activation of calcium-activated hyperpolarizing conductances. We report that
      cholinergic excitation can be improved in TgCRND8 cortex by pharmacological
      blockade of SK channels, suggesting a novel target for the treatment of cognitive
      dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Alzheimer's disease
      is accompanied by attention deficits that exacerbate its other cognitive
      symptoms. In brain slices of a mouse model of this neurological disorder, we
      demonstrate, characterize, and rescue impaired cholinergic excitation of neurons 
      essential for optimal attentional performance. In particular, we show that the
      excessive activation of a calcium-activated potassium conductance disrupts the
      acetylcholine excitation of prefrontal layer 6 pyramidal neurons and that its
      blockade normalizes responses. These findings point to a novel potential target
      for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Default Mode Connectivity in Youth With Perinatally Acquired HIV.
PG  - e1417
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000001417 [doi]
AB  - Youth with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus (PHIV+) survive
      longer with combination antiretroviral therapy, but remain at risk for poor
      cognitive outcomes. We evaluated whether markers of HIV disease severity relate
      to default mode resting-state functional connectivity in PHIV+ youth.We conducted
      resting-state functional neuroimaging and cognitive testing in a subset of 40
      PHIV+ youth recruited from a single study site of the Adolescent Master Protocol 
      study conducted by the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) network. Current
      and past HIV disease severity measures (nadir CD4 lymphocyte percentages and peak
      HIV RNA plasma levels) were obtained from medical charts.We evaluated
      associations of both HIV disease severity measures and cognitive functioning with
      between- and within- default mode network (DMN) connectivity using Analysis of
      Functional NeuroImaging multiple regression analyses, controlling for multiple
      comparisons.Of the 40 youth, 31 (mean age = 16.5 years) with minimal motion
      during scans were included. We observed global alterations in DMN within- and
      between-network connectivity, with significant associations between disease
      severity and DMN BOLD correlations. Furthermore, patterns of connectivity with
      the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that
      varied as a function of peak HIV RNA were found to predict processing speed
      ability.Alterations in within- and between-network DMN connectivity in PHIV+
      youth may reflect global reorganization of the DMN; this could lead to
      compensatory alterations in both the within- and between-connectivity of
      large-scale networks, which may ultimately relate to known cognitive processing
      difficulties in PHIV+ youth.

TI  - How the Non-attending Brain Hears Its Owner's Name.
LID - bhv184 [pii]
AB  - We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how attended and
      non-attended hearing of a subject's own name (SON) captures his or her attention.
      It has been reported that SON presentation activates the medial prefrontal cortex
      (mPFC), which is considered to be the key region for self-recognition. However,
      it remains unclear whether non-attended SON presentation also activates the mPFC.
      We hypothesized that an attended SON should activate mPFC more than a
      non-attended SON. To test this hypothesis, we designed an experiment in which we 
      manipulated the task-relevance of SON; in a name-detection task, SON was a target
      stimulus, whereas in a tone-judgment task, SON was unrelated to the task. In each
      condition, identical sets of sound stimuli were presented. SON activated mPFC in 
      the name-detection task but not in the tone-judgment task, supporting our
      hypothesis. In contrast, non-attended SON activated midbrain reticular formation,
      thalamus, insula, auditory cortex, and precuneus. We interpreted these to be
      related to low-level, automatic SON detection. Thus, hearing one's own name in a 
      non-attended condition does not primarily engage the mPFC, but recruits a
      cortico-subcortical auditory attention network; this may account for the
      oft-observed salience of SON.

TI  - Altered functioning of reward circuitry in youth offspring of parents with
      bipolar disorder.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD) (BO) are at higher
      risk of BD than offspring of parents with non-BD psychopathology (NBO), although 
      both groups are at higher risk than offspring of psychiatrically healthy parents 
      (HC) for other affective and psychiatric disorders. Abnormal functioning in
      reward circuitry has been demonstrated previously in individuals with BD. We
      aimed to determine whether activation and functional connectivity in this
      circuitry during risky decision-making differentiated BO, NBO and HC. METHOD: BO 
      (n = 29; mean age = 13.8 years; 14 female), NBO (n = 28; mean age = 13.9 years;
      12 female) and HC (n = 23; mean age = 13.7 years; 11 female) were scanned while
      performing a number-guessing reward task. Of the participants, 11 BO and 12 NBO
      had current non-BD psychopathology; five BO and four NBO were taking psychotropic
      medications. RESULTS: A 3 (group) x 2 (conditions: win-control/loss-control)
      analysis of variance revealed a main effect of group on right frontal pole
      activation: BO showed significantly greater activation than HC. There was a
      significant main effect of group on functional connectivity between the bilateral
      ventral striatum and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (Z > 3.09,
      cluster-p < 0.05): BO showed significantly greater negative functional
      connectivity than other participants. These between-group differences remained
      after removing youth with psychiatric disorders and psychotropic medications from
      analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that reward
      circuitry activation and functional connectivity distinguish BO from NBO and HC. 
      The fact that the pattern of findings remained when comparing healthy BO v.
      healthy NBO v. HC suggests that these neuroimaging measures may represent
      trait-level neurobiological markers conferring either risk for, or protection
      against, BD in youth.

      Behavioral Addictions?
PG  - 75-85
AB  - We reviewed the cognitive and neurobiological commonalities between chemical and 
      behavioral addictions. Poor impulse control, limited executive function and
      abnormalities in reward processing are seen in both group of entities. Brain
      imaging shows consistent abnormalities in frontoparietal regions and the limbic
      system. In drug addiction, exaggerated risk taking behavior and temporal
      discounting may reflect an imbalance between a hyperactive mesolimbic and
      hypoactive executive systems. Several cognitive distortions are found in
      pathological gambling that seems to harness the brain reward system that has
      evolved to face situations related to skill, not random chance. Abnormalities in 
      risk assessment and impulsivity are found in variety of eating disorders, in
      particularly related to eating behavior. Corresponding findings in eating
      disorder patients include abnormalities in the limbic system, i.e. orbitofrontal 
      cortex (OFC), striatum and insula. Similarly, internet addiction disorder is
      associated with risky decision making and increased choice impulsivity with
      corresponding discrepant activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, OFC,
      anterior cingulate cortex, caudate and insula. Sexual addictions are in turn
      associated with exaggerated impulsive choice and suggestive evidence of
      abnormalities in reward processing. In sum, exploration of executive function and
      decision making abnormalities in chemical and behavioral addictions may increase 
      understanding in their psychopathology and yield valuable targets for therapeutic
      interventions.

LID - 10.1101/lm.038372.115 [doi]
AB  - To test the hypothesis that thalamic midline nuclei play a transient role in
      memory consolidation, we reanalyzed a prospective functional MRI study,
      contrasting recent and progressively more remote memory retrieval. We revealed a 
      transient thalamic connectivity increase with the hippocampus, the medial
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and a parahippocampal area, which decreased with time. 
      In turn, mPFC-parahippocampal connectivity increased progressively. These
      findings support a model in which thalamic midline nuclei serve as a hub linking 
      hippocampus, mPFC, and posterior representational areas during memory retrieval
      at an early (2 h) stage of consolidation, extending classical systems
      consolidation models by attributing a transient role to midline thalamic nuclei.

TI  - Network dysfunction of emotional and cognitive processes in those at genetic risk
      of bipolar disorder.
PG  - 3427-39
LID - 10.1093/brain/awv261 [doi]
AB  - The emotional and cognitive vulnerabilities that precede the development of
      bipolar disorder are poorly understood. The inferior frontal gyrus-a key cortical
      hub for the integration of cognitive and emotional processes-exhibits both
      structural and functional changes in bipolar disorder, and is also functionally
      impaired in unaffected first-degree relatives, showing diminished engagement
      during inhibition of threat-related emotional stimuli. We hypothesized that this 
      functional impairment of the inferior frontal gyrus in those at genetic risk of
      bipolar disorder reflects the dysfunction of broader network dynamics underlying 
      the coordination of emotion perception and cognitive control. To test this, we
      studied effective connectivity in functional magnetic resonance imaging data
      acquired from 41 first-degree relatives of patients with bipolar disorder, 45
      matched healthy controls and 55 participants with established bipolar disorder.
      Dynamic causal modelling was used to model the neuronal interaction between key
      regions associated with fear perception (the anterior cingulate), inhibition (the
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and the region upon which these influences
      converge, namely the inferior frontal gyrus. Network models that embodied
      non-linear, hierarchical relationships were the most strongly supported by data
      from our healthy control and bipolar participants. We observed a marked
      difference in the hierarchical influence of the anterior cingulate on the
      effective connectivity from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to the inferior
      frontal gyrus that is unique to the at-risk cohort. Non-specific,
      non-hierarchical mechanisms appear to compensate for this network disturbance. We
      thus establish a specific network disturbance suggesting dysfunction in the
      processes that support hierarchical relationships between emotion and cognitive
      control in those at high genetic risk for bipolar disorder.

TI  - Manic episodes are related to changes in frontal cortex: a longitudinal
      neuroimaging study of bipolar disorder 1.

AB  - Higher numbers of manic episodes in bipolar patients has, in cross-sectional
      studies, been associated with less grey matter volume in prefrontal brain areas. 
      Longitudinal studies are needed to determine if manic episodes set off
      progressive cortical changes, or if the association is better explained by
      premorbid brain conditions that increase risk for mania. We followed patients
      with bipolar disorder type 1 for 6 years. Structural brain magnetic resonance
      imaging scans were performed at baseline and follow-up. We compared patients who 
      had at least one manic episode between baseline and follow-up (Mania group, n =
      13) with those who had no manic episodes (No-Mania group, n = 18). We used
      measures of cortical volume, thickness, and area to assess grey matter changes
      between baseline and follow-up. We found significantly decreased frontal cortical
      volume (dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior frontal cortex) in the Mania group, 
      but no volume changes in the No-Mania group. Our results indicate that volume
      decrease in frontal brain regions can be attributed to the incidence of manic
      episodes.

AB  - Oxidative stress has been implicated in many common age-related diseases and is
      hypothesized to play a role in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related
      neurodegeneration (Miller and Sadeh, 2014). This study examined the influence of 
      the oxidative stress-related genes ALOX 12 and ALOX 15 on the association between
      PTSD and cortical thickness. Factor analyses were used to identify and compare
      alternative models of the structure of cortical thickness in a sample of 218
      veterans. The best-fitting model was then used for a genetic association analysis
      in White non-Hispanic participants (n=146) that examined relationships between 33
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the two genes, 8 cortical
      thickness factors, and each SNPxPTSD interaction. Results identified a novel
      ALOX12 locus (indicated by two SNPs in perfect linkage disequilibrium: rs1042357 
      and rs10852889) that moderated the association between PTSD and reduced thickness
      of the right prefrontal cortex. A whole-cortex vertex-wise analysis showed this
      effect to be localized to clusters spanning the rostral middle frontal gyrus,
      superior frontal gyrus, rostral anterior cingulate cortex, and medial
      orbitofrontal cortex. These findings illustrate a novel factor-analytic approach 
      to neuroimaging-genetic analyses and provide new evidence for the possible
      involvement of oxidative stress in PTSD-related neurodegeneration.

TI  - Test-retest reliability of pain-related functional brain connectivity compared to
      pain self-report.
AB  - Test-retest reliability, or reproducibility of results over time, is poorly
      established for functional brain connectivity (fcMRI) during painful stimulation.
      As reliability informs the validity of research findings, it is imperative to
      examine, especially given recent emphasis on using functional neuroimaging as a
      tool for biomarker development. Although proposed pain neural signatures have
      been derived using complex, multivariate algorithms, even the reliability of less
      complex fcMRI findings has yet to be reported. The present study examined the
      test-retest reliability for fcMRI of pain-related brain regions, as well as
      self-reported pain [via visual analogue scales (VASs)]. Thirty-two healthy
      individuals completed three consecutive fMRI runs of a thermal pain task.
      Functional connectivity analyses were completed on pain-related brain regions.
      Intraclass correlations (ICC) were conducted on fcMRI values and VAS scores
      across the fMRI runs. ICC coefficients for fcMRI values varied widely (range =
      -.174-.766), with fcMRI between right nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal
      cortex showing the highest reliability (range = .649-.766). ICC coefficients for 
      VAS scores ranged from .906-.947. Overall, self-reported pain was more reliable
      than fcMRI data. These results highlight that fMRI findings might be less
      reliable than inherently assumed, and have implications for future studies
      proposing pain markers.

TI  - The person within: memory codes for persons and traits using fMRI repetition
      suppression.
LID - nsv100 [pii]
AB  - Neuroimaging studies on trait inference demonstrated that the ventral medial
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC) houses neural representations of memory codes for traits
      . In this study, we investigate the neural code not only of traits, but also of
      persons who exemplify these traits. We used repetition suppression, which is a
      rapid suppression of the neuroimaging signal upon repeated presentation of the
      same stimulus or core stimulus characteristics-in this case, the implied trait
      and person. Participants inferred familiar person's traits. At each trial, a
      critical (target) sentence described a behavior that implied a trait, and was
      preceded by a (prime) sentence that implied the same trait and portrayed the same
      person, the same trait but portrayed a different person or did not imply a trait 
      and portrayed a different person. As predicted, we found partly overlapping
      repetition suppression areas in the ventral mPFC when persons and traits were
      repeated, indicating that not only traits but also familiar persons have a neural
      code in the ventral mPFC. We also found a negative correlation between activation
      when reading about a new person and participants' social network size, indicating
      that experience with larger social groups results in less recruitment of a person
      code.

TI  - Resting-state functional connectivity and presynaptic monoamine signaling in
      Alcohol Dependence.
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22951 [doi]
AB  - Alcohol Dependence (AD) is a chronic relapsing disorder with high degrees of
      morbidity and mortality. While multiple neurotransmitter systems are involved in 
      the complex symptomatology of AD, monoamine dysregulation and subsequent
      neuroadaptations have been long postulated to play an important role. Presynaptic
      monoamine transporters, such as the vesicular monoamine transporter 1 (VMAT1),
      are likely critical as they represent a key common entry point for monoamine
      regulation and may represent a shared pathway for susceptibility to AD. Excessive
      monoaminergic signaling as mediated by genetic variation in VMAT1 might affect
      functional brain connectivity in particular in alcoholics compared to controls.
      We conducted resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC) analysis using the
      independent component analysis (ICA) approach in 68 AD subjects and 72 controls. 
      All subjects were genotyped for the Thr136Ile (rs1390938) variant in VMAT1.
      Functional connectivity analyses showed a significant increase of resting-state
      FC in 4 networks in alcoholics compared to controls (P < 0.05, corrected). The FC
      was significantly positively correlated with Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS). The 
      hyperfunction allele 136Ile was associated with a significantly decreased FC in
      the Default Mode Network, Prefrontal Cortex Network, and Executive Control
      Network in alcohol dependent participants (P < 0.05, corrected), but not in
      controls. Our data suggest that increased FC might represent a neuroadaptive
      mechanism relevant to AD that is furthermore mediated by genetic variation in
      VMAT1. The hyperfunction allele Thr136Ile might have a protective effect that is,
      in particular, relevant in AD by mechanism of increased monoamine transport into 
      presynaptic storage vesicles. Hum Brain Mapp, 2015. Published 2015. This article

TI  - Cortico-Striatal GABAergic and Glutamatergic Dysregulations in Subjects at
      Ultra-High Risk for Psychosis Investigated with Proton Magnetic Resonance
      Spectroscopy.
LID - pyv105 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyv105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysregulations of the major inhibitory and excitatory amino
      neurotransmitter systems of gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate, respectively, 
      have been described in patients with schizophrenia. However, it is unclear
      whether these abnormalities are present in subjects at ultra-high risk for
      psychosis. METHODS: Twenty-three antipsychotic naive subjects at ultra-high risk 
      and 24 healthy control subjects, matched for age, sex, handedness, cigarette
      smoking, and parental education, underwent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      scans in the dorsal caudate bilaterally and the medial prefrontal cortex at 3T.
      Levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid and of the combined resonance of glutamate and 
      glutamine (Glx) were obtained using the standard J-editing technique and
      expressed as peak area ratios relative to the synchronously acquired unsuppressed
      voxel water signal. RESULTS: Higher levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (P<.001)
      and Glx (P=.007) were found in the dorsal caudate of the subjects at ultra-high
      risk than in the healthy controls. In the medial prefrontal cortex, likewise,
      both gamma-aminobutyric acid (P=.03) and Glx (P=.006) levels were higher in the
      ultra-high risk group than in the healthy controls. No group differences were
      found for any of the other metabolites (N-acetylaspartate, total choline, or
      total creatine) in the 2 regions of interest. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents
      the first evidence of abnormal elevations, in subjects at ultra-high risk, of
      gamma-aminobutyric acid and Glx in 2 brain regions that have been implicated in
      the pathophysiology of psychosis, warranting longitudinal studies to assess
      whether these neurotransmitter abnormalities can serve as noninvasive biomarkers 
      of conversion risk to psychosis as well as of illness progression and treatment
      response.

AB  - Neurobiological investigation of heroin revealed that abusers of this highly
      addictive substance show dysregulation in brain circuits for reward processing
      and cognitive control. Psychologically, personality traits related to reward
      processing and cognitive control differed between heroin abusers and non-abusers.
      Yet, there is no direct evidence on the relationship between these
      neurobiological and psychological findings on heroin abusers, and whether such
      relationship is altered in these abusers. The present study filled this research 
      gap by integrating findings obtained via magnetic resonance imaging (structural
      volume and resting-state functional connectivity) and self-reported personality
      trait measures (Zuckermans Sensation Seeking Scale and Barratt Impulsivity Scale)
      on 33 abstinent heroin users and 30 matched healthy controls. The key finding is 
      a negative relationship between high sensation seeking tendency and midbrain
      structural volume in the heroin users. Importantly, there was stronger coupling
      between the midbrain and ventromedial prefrontal cortex and weaker coupling
      between the midbrain and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in heroin users. Our
      findings offer significant insight into the neural underpinning of sensation
      seeking in heroin users. Importantly, the data shed light on a novel relationship
      between the mesolimbic-prefrontal pathway of the reward system and the high
      sensation seeking personality trait in heroin abusers.

AB  - Precise evaluation of the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) is
      important for diagnosis, prediction of prognosis, and management of patients with
      disorders of impaired consciousness. In the current study, we attempted to
      reconstruct the direct neural pathway between the brainstem reticular formation
      (RF) and the cerebral cortex in normal subjects, using diffusion tensor imaging
      (DTI). Forty-one healthy subjects were recruited for this study. DTIs were
      performed using a sensitivity-encoding head coil at 1.5Tesla with FMRIB Software 
      Library. For connectivity of the brainstem RF, we used two regions of interest
      (ROIs) for the brainstem RF (seed ROI) and the thalamus and hypothalamus
      (exclusion ROI). Connectivity was defined as the incidence of connection between 
      the brainstem RF and target brain regions at the threshold of 5 and 50
      streamlines. Regarding the thresholds of 5 and 50, the brainstem RF showed high
      connectivity to the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC, 67.1% and 20.7%) and
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC, 50.0% and 18.3%), respectively. In
      contrast, the brainstem RF showed low connectivity to the primary motor cortex
      (31.7% and 3.7%), premotor cortex (24.4% and 3.7%), primary somatosensory cortex 
      (23.2% and 2.4%), orbitofrontal cortex (17.1% and 7.3%), and posterior parietal
      cortex (12.2% and 0%), respectively. The brainstem RF was mainly connected to the
      prefrontal cortex, particularly lPFC and vmPFC. We believe that the methodology
      and results of this study would be useful to clinicians involved in the care of
      patients with impaired consciousness and researchers in studies of the ARAS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One neurodevelopmental theory hypothesizes remission of
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to result from improved
      prefrontal top-down control, while ADHD, independent of the current diagnosis, is
      characterized by stable non-cortical deficits (Halperin & Schulz, 2006). We
      tested this theory using resting state functional MRI (fMRI) data in a large
      sample of adolescents with remitting ADHD, persistent ADHD, and healthy controls.
      METHODS: Participants in this follow-up study were 100 healthy controls and 129
      adolescents with ADHD combined type at baseline (mean age at baseline 11.8 years;
      at follow-up 17.5 years). Diagnostic information was collected twice and
      augmented with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning at follow-up. We used
      resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the executive control network to 
      investigate whether improved prefrontal top-down control was related to a
      developmental decrease in ADHD symptoms. In addition, we tested whether
      non-cortical RSFC, i.e., cerebellar and striatal RSFC, was aberrant in persistent
      and/or remittent ADHD compared to controls. RESULTS: Higher connectivity within
      frontal regions (anterior cingulate cortex) of the executive control network was 
      related to decreases in ADHD symptoms. This association was driven by change in
      hyperactive/impulsive symptoms and not by change in inattention. Participants
      with remitting ADHD showed stronger RSFC than controls within this network, while
      persistent ADHD cases exhibited RSFC strengths intermediate to remittent ADHD
      cases and controls. Cerebellar and subcortical RSFC did not differ between
      participants with ADHD and controls. CONCLUSIONS: In line with the
      neurodevelopmental theory, symptom recovery in ADHD was related to stronger
      integration of prefrontal regions in the executive control network. The pattern
      of RSFC strength across remittent ADHD, persistent ADHD, and healthy controls
      potentially reflects the presence of compensatory neural mechanisms that aid
      symptomatic remission.

AB  - Measures of psychopathy have been proved to be valuable for risk assessment in
      violent criminals. However, the neuronal basis of psychopathy and its
      contribution to the prediction of criminal recidivism is still poorly understood.
      We compared structural imaging data from 40 male high-risk violent offenders and 
      37 non-delinquent healthy controls via voxel-based morphometry. Psychopathic
      traits and risk of violence recidivism were correlated with gray matter volume
      (GMV) of regions of interest previously shown relevant for criminal behavior.
      Relative to controls, criminals showed less GMV in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      and more GMV in cerebellar regions and basal ganglia structures. Within
      criminals, we found a negative correlation between prefrontal GMV and
      psychopathy. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between cerebellar
      GMV and psychopathy as well as risk of recidivism for violence. Moreover, GMVs of
      the basal ganglia and supplementary motor area (SMA) were positively correlated
      with anti-sociality. GMV of the amygdala was negatively correlated with dynamic
      risk for violence recidivism. In contrast, GMV of (para)limbic areas
      (orbitofrontal cortex, insula) was positively correlated with anti-sociality and 
      risk of violence recidivism. The current investigation revealed that in violent
      offenders deviations in GMV of the PFC as well as areas involved in the motor
      component of impulse control (cerebellum, basal ganglia, SMA) are differentially 
      related to psychopathic traits and the risk of violence recidivism. The results
      might be valuable for improving existing risk assessment tools.

TI  - The CB1 Neutral Antagonist Tetrahydrocannabivarin Reduces Default Mode Network
      and Increases Executive Control Network Resting State Functional Connectivity in 
      Healthy Volunteers.
LID - pyv092 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyv092 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cannabinoid cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) neutral antagonist
      tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCv) has been suggested as a possible treatment for
      obesity, but without the depressogenic side-effects of inverse antagonists such
      as Rimonabant. However, how THCv might affect the resting state functional
      connectivity of the human brain is as yet unknown. METHOD: We examined the
      effects of a single 10mg oral dose of THCv and placebo in 20 healthy volunteers
      in a randomized, within-subject, double-blind design. Using resting state
      functional magnetic resonance imaging and seed-based connectivity analyses, we
      selected the amygdala, insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and dorsal medial prefrontal
      cortex (dmPFC) as regions of interest. Mood and subjective experience were also
      measured before and after drug administration using self-report scales. RESULTS: 
      Our results revealed, as expected, no significant differences in the subjective
      experience with a single dose of THCv. However, we found reduced resting state
      functional connectivity between the amygdala seed region and the default mode
      network and increased resting state functional connectivity between the amygdala 
      seed region and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and between the dmPFC seed
      region and the inferior frontal gyrus/medial frontal gyrus. We also found a
      positive correlation under placebo for the amygdala-precuneus connectivity with
      the body mass index, although this correlation was not apparent under THCv.
      CONCLUSION: Our findings are the first to show that treatment with the CB1
      neutral antagonist THCv decreases resting state functional connectivity in the
      default mode network and increases connectivity in the cognitive control network 
      and dorsal visual stream network. This effect profile suggests possible
      therapeutic activity of THCv for obesity, where functional connectivity has been 
      found to be altered in these regions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adults with Down syndrome (DS) invariably develop Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) neuropathology. Understanding amyloid deposition in DS can yield
      crucial information about disease pathogenesis. METHODS: Forty-nine adults with
      DS aged 25-65 underwent positron emission tomography with Pittsburgh compound-B
      (PIB). Regional PIB binding was assessed with respect to age, clinical, and
      cognitive status. RESULTS: Abnormal PIB binding became evident from 39 years,
      first in striatum followed by rostral prefrontal-cingulo-parietal regions, then
      caudal frontal, rostral temporal, primary sensorimotor and occipital, and finally
      parahippocampal cortex, thalamus, and amygdala. PIB binding was related to age,
      diagnostic status, and cognitive function. DISCUSSION: PIB binding in DS, first
      appearing in striatum, began around age 40 and was strongly associated with
      dementia and cognitive decline. The absence of a substantial time lag between
      amyloid accumulation and cognitive decline contrasts to sporadic/familial AD and 
      suggests this population's suitability for an amyloid primary prevention trial.

TI  - Brain structural and functional connectivity in Parkinson's disease with freezing
      of gait.
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22994 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use a multimodal approach to assess brain structural pathways and
      resting state (RS) functional connectivity abnormalities in patients with
      Parkinson's disease and freezing of gait (PD-FoG). METHODS: T1-weighted,
      diffusion tensor (DT) MRI and RS functional MRI (fMRI) were obtained from 22
      PD-FoG patients and 35 controls on a 3.0 T MR scanner. Patients underwent
      clinical, motor, and neuropsychological evaluations. Gray matter (GM) volumes and
      white matter (WM) damage were assessed using voxel based morphometry and
      tract-based spatial statistics, respectively. The pedunculopontine tract (PPT)
      was studied using tractography. RS fMRI data were analyzed using a model free
      approach investigating the main sensorimotor and cognitive brain networks.
      Multiple regression models were performed to assess the relationships between
      structural, functional, and clinical/cognitive variables. Analysis of GM and WM
      structural abnormalities was replicated in an independent sample including 28
      PD-FoG patients, 25 PD patients without FoG, and 30 healthy controls who
      performed MRI scans on a 1.5 T scanner. RESULTS: Compared with controls, no GM
      atrophy was found in PD-FoG cases. PD-FoG patients showed WM damage of the PPT,
      corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus,
      and WM underneath the primary motor, premotor, prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and
      inferior parietal cortices, bilaterally. In PD-FoG, right PTT damage was
      associated with a greater disease severity. Analysis on the independent PD sample
      showed similar findings in PD-FoG patients relative to controls as well as WM
      damage of the genu and body of the corpus callosum and right parietal WM in
      PD-FoG relative to PD no-FoG patients. RS fMRI analysis showed that PD-FoG is
      associated with a decreased functional connectivity of the primary motor cortex
      and supplementary motor area bilaterally in the sensorimotor network,
      frontoparietal regions in the default mode network, and occipital cortex in the
      visual associative network. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that FoG in PD can
      be the result of a poor structural and functional integration between motor and
      extramotor (cognitive) neural systems. Hum Brain Mapp, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley

TI  - Step-down vs. step-up noxious stimulation: differential effects on pain
      perception and patterns of brain activation.
LID - 10.1111/aas.12607 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesize that pain and brain responses are affected by changes 
      in the presentation sequence of noxious stimuli that are, overall, identical in
      intensity and duration. METHODS: During functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) scanning, 21 participants experienced three patterns of noxious
      stimulation: Up-type (step-up noxious stimulation, 15 s), Down-type (step-down
      noxious stimulation, 15 s), and Down-up-type (decreasing and increasing pattern
      of noxious stimulation, 15 s). The total intensity and duration of the three
      noxious stimulation patterns were identical, but the stimulation sequences were
      different. RESULTS: Pain and unpleasantness ratings in the Down- and Down-up-type
      noxious stimulations were lower than in the Up-type noxious stimulation. The left
      prefrontal cortex [(PFC, BA (Brodmann area) 10, (-45, 50, 1)] was more highly
      activated in the Down- and Down-up-type noxious stimulations than in the Up-type 
      noxious stimulation. The S1, S2, insula, bilateral PFC (BA 46), and midcingulate 
      cortex were more highly activated in the Up-type noxious stimulation than in the 
      Down-type noxious stimulation. PFC BA 10 was located at an inferior level
      compared to the bilateral PFC BA 46 (Z axis = 1 for BA 10, compared to 22 and 25 
      for the right and left BA 46, respectively). When cortisol level was increased,
      the left hippocampal cortex, along with the left parahippocampal cortex, was
      greatly activated for the Up-type noxious stimulation. CONCLUSION: When pain
      cannot be avoided in clinical practice, noxious stimuli should be applied to
      patients in a step-down pattern that delivers the most intense pain first and the
      least intense pain last.

TI  - Neural Dysfunction in Cognitive Control Circuits in Persons at Clinical High-Risk
      for Psychosis.
LID - 10.1038/npp.2015.273 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive control, a set of functions that develop throughout adolescence, is
      important in the pathogenesis of psychotic disorders. Whether cognitive control
      pays a role in conferring vulnerability for the development of psychotic illness 
      is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the neural systems
      supporting cognitive control in individuals deemed to be potentially prodromal
      for psychotic illness. We recruited 56 participants at clinical high-risk (CHR)
      for psychosis based on the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes
      (SIPS) and 49 healthy controls. Twelve of the CHR participants eventually
      developed psychosis. We compared functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      BOLD signal during the performance of the Simon task. We tested for differences
      between CHR individuals and controls in conflict-related functional activity. In 
      the CHR group when compared to controls, we detected smaller conflict-related
      activations in several cortical areas, including the Dorsolateral Prefrontal
      Cortex (DLPFC). Furthermore, conflict-related activations in the DLPFC of those
      CHR individuals who ultimately developed psychosis (CHR converters) were smaller 
      than in non-converters (CHR-non converters). Higher levels of conflict-related
      activation were associated with better social and role outcome. Risk for
      psychosis was associated at the neural level with reduced conflict-related brain 
      activity. This neural phenotype appears correlated within the DLPFC with the
      development of psychosis and functional outcome.Neuropsychopharmacology accepted

TI  - The Neural Correlates of Shoulder Apprehension: A Functional MRI Study.
PG  - e0137387
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0137387 [doi]
AB  - Although shoulder apprehension is an established clinical finding and is
      important for the prevention of shoulder dislocation, how this subjective
      perception is evoked remains unclear. We elucidated the functional
      neuroplasticity associated with apprehension in patients with recurrent anterior 
      shoulder instability (RSI) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
      Twelve healthy volunteers and 14 patients with right-sided RSI performed a motor 
      imagery task and a passive shoulder motion task. Brain activity was compared
      between healthy participants and those with RSI and was correlated with the
      apprehension intensity reported by participants after each task. Compared to
      healthy volunteers, participants with RSI exhibited decreased brain activity in
      the motor network, but increased activity in the hippocampus and amygdala. During
      the passive motion task, participants with RSI exhibited decreased activity in
      the left premotor and primary motor/somatosensory areas. Furthermore, brain
      activity was correlated with apprehension intensity in the left amygdala and left
      thalamus during the motor imagery task (memory-induced), while a correlation
      between apprehension intensity and brain activity was found in the left
      prefrontal cortex during the passive motion task (instability-induced). Our
      findings provide insight into the pathophysiology of RSI by identifying its
      associated neural alterations. We elucidated that shoulder apprehension was
      induced by two different factors, namely instability and memory.

TI  - Face Patch Resting State Networks Link Face Processing to Social Cognition.
PG  - e1002245
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002245 [doi]
AB  - Faces transmit a wealth of social information. How this information is exchanged 
      between face-processing centers and brain areas supporting social cognition
      remains largely unclear. Here we identify these routes using resting state
      functional magnetic resonance imaging in macaque monkeys. We find that face areas
      functionally connect to specific regions within frontal, temporal, and parietal
      cortices, as well as subcortical structures supporting emotive, mnemonic, and
      cognitive functions. This establishes the existence of an extended
      face-recognition system in the macaque. Furthermore, the face patch resting state
      networks and the default mode network in monkeys show a pattern of overlap akin
      to that between the social brain and the default mode network in humans: this
      overlap specifically includes the posterior superior temporal sulcus, medial
      parietal, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, areas supporting high-level social
      cognition in humans. Together, these results reveal the embedding of face areas
      into larger brain networks and suggest that the resting state networks of the
      face patch system offer a new, easily accessible venue into the functional
      organization of the social brain and into the evolution of possibly uniquely
      human social skills.

      A multi-study analysis.

AB  - This multi-study connectivity analysis explores the functional connectivity of
      the cerebellum with the cerebrum in social mentalizing, that is, understanding
      the mind of another person. The analysis covers 5 studies (n=92) involving
      abstract and complex forms of social mentalizing such as (a) person and group
      impression formation based on behavioral descriptions and (b) constructing
      personal counterfactual events (i.e., how the past could have turned out better).
      The results suggest that cerebellar activity during these social processes
      reflects a domain-specific mentalizing functionality that is strongly connected
      with a corresponding mentalizing network in the cerebrum. A significant pattern
      of connectivity was found linking the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and 
      the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) with the right posterior cerebellum,
      and linking the latter with the left TPJ. In addition, in the cerebrum, further
      connectivity was found through links of the bilateral TPJ with the dorsal mPFC,
      orbitofrontal cortex and between right and left TPJ. The discussion centers on
      the role of these cerebro-cerebellar connections in matching external information
      from the cerebrum with internal predictions generated by the cerebellum. These
      internal predictions might involve the sequencing of the person's behaviors.

AB  - The neuronal processes underlying dance observation have been the focus of an
      increasing number of brain imaging studies over the past decade. However, the
      existing literature mainly dealt with effects of motor and visual expertise,
      whereas the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie the interpretation of
      dance choreographies remained unexplored. Hence, much attention has been given to
      the action observation network (AON) whereas the role of other potentially
      relevant neuro-cognitive mechanisms such as mentalizing (theory of mind) or
      language (narrative comprehension) in dance understanding is yet to be
      elucidated. We report the results of an fMRI study where the structural coherence
      of short contemporary dance choreographies was manipulated parametrically using
      the same taped movement material. Our participants were all trained dancers. The 
      whole-brain analysis argues that the interpretation of structurally coherent
      dance phrases involves a subpart (superior parietal) of the AON as well as
      mentalizing regions in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. An ROI analysis based
      on a similar study using linguistic materials (Pallier et al., 2011) suggests
      that structural processing in language and dance might share certain neural
      mechanisms.

LID - 10.1016/j.dcn.2015.08.007 [doi]
AB  - Cannabis use in adolescence may be characterized by differences in the neural
      basis of affective processing. In this study, we used an fMRI affective face
      processing task to compare a large group (n=70) of 14-year olds with a history of
      cannabis use to a group (n=70) of never-using controls matched on numerous
      characteristics including IQ, SES, alcohol and cigarette use. The task contained 
      short movies displaying angry and neutral faces. Results indicated that cannabis 
      users had greater reactivity in the bilateral amygdalae to angry faces than
      neutral faces, an effect that was not observed in their abstinent peers. In
      contrast, activity levels in the cannabis users in cortical areas including the
      right temporal-parietal junction and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex did
      not discriminate between the two face conditions, but did differ in controls.
      Results did not change after excluding subjects with any psychiatric
      symptomology. Given the high density of cannabinoid receptors in the amygdala,
      our findings suggest cannabis use in early adolescence is associated with
      hypersensitivity to signals of threat. Hypersensitivity to negative affect in
      adolescence may place the subject at-risk for mood disorders in adulthood.

TI  - Intranasal Oxytocin Affects Amygdala Functional Connectivity after Trauma
      Script-Driven Imagery in Distressed Recently Trauma-Exposed Individuals.
LID - 10.1038/npp.2015.278 [doi]
AB  - Approximately 10% of trauma-exposed individuals go on to develop post-traumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD). Neural emotion regulation may be etiologically involved
      in PTSD development. Oxytocin administration early post-trauma may be a promising
      avenue for PTSD prevention, as intranasal oxytocin has previously been found to
      affect emotion regulation networks in healthy individuals and psychiatric
      patients. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled between-subjects
      functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) study, we assessed the effects of a single
      intranasal oxytocin administration (40 IU) on seed-based amygdala resting-state
      FC with emotion regulation areas (ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC),
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC)), and salience processing areas (insula, 
      dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)) in 37 individuals within 11 days post
      trauma. Two resting-state scans were acquired; one after neutral- and one after
      trauma-script-driven imagery. We found that oxytocin administration reduced
      amygdala-left vlPFC FC after trauma script-driven imagery, compared with neutral 
      script-driven imagery, whereas in PL-treated participants enhanced amygdala-left 
      vlPFC FC was observed following trauma script-driven imagery. Irrespective of
      script condition, oxytocin increased amygdala-insula FC and decreased
      amygdala-vmPFC FC. These neural effects were accompanied by lower levels of
      sleepiness and higher flashback intensity in the oxytocin group after the trauma 
      script. Together, our findings show that oxytocin administration may impede
      emotion regulation network functioning in response to trauma reminders in
      recently trauma-exposed individuals. Therefore, caution may be warranted in
      administering oxytocin to prevent PTSD in distressed, recently trauma-exposed
      individuals.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 7 October 2015;

TI  - Altered superficial amygdala-cortical functional link in resting state after 36
      hours of total sleep deprivation.
PG  - 1795-803
LID - 10.1002/jnr.23601 [doi]
AB  - The superficial amygdala (SFA) is important in human emotion/affective processing
      via its strong connection with other limbic and cerebral cortex for receptive and
      expressive emotion processing. Few studies have investigated the functional
      connectivity changes of the SFA under extreme conditions, such as prolonged sleep
      loss, although the SFA showed a distinct functional connectivity pattern
      throughout the brain. In this study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (rs-fMRI) was employed to investigate the changes of SFA-cortical
      functional connectivity after 36 hr of total sleep deprivation (TSD). Fourteen
      healthy male volunteers aged 25.9 +/- 2.3 years (range 18-28 years) enrolled in
      this within-subject crossover study. We found that the right SFA showed increased
      functional connectivity with the right medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and
      decreased functional connectivity with the right dorsal posterior cingulate
      cortex (dPCC) in the resting brain after TSD compared with that during rested
      wakefulness. For the left SFA, decreased connectivity with the right dorsal
      anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right dPCC was found. Further regression
      analysis indicated that the functional link between mPFC and SFA significantly
      correlated with the Profile of Mood State scores. Our results suggest that the
      amygdala cannot be treated as a single unit in human neuroimaging studies and
      that TSD may alter the functional connectivity pattern of the SFA, which in turn 
      disrupts emotional regulation. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Reading fiction and reading minds: the role of simulation in the default network.
LID - nsv114 [pii]
AB  - Research in psychology has suggested that reading fiction can improve
      individuals' social-cognitive abilities. Findings from neuroscience show that
      reading and social cognition both recruit the default network, a network which is
      known to support our capacity to simulate hypothetical scenes, spaces and mental 
      states. The current research tests the hypothesis that fiction reading enhances
      social cognition because it serves to exercise the default subnetwork involved in
      theory of mind. While undergoing functional neuroimaging, participants read
      literary passages that differed along two dimensions: (i) vivid vs abstract and
      (ii) social vs non-social. Analyses revealed distinct subnetworks of the default 
      network respond to the two dimensions of interest: the medial temporal lobe
      subnetwork responded preferentially to vivid passages, with or without social
      content; the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) subnetwork responded
      preferentially to passages with social and abstract content. Analyses also
      demonstrated that participants who read fiction most often also showed the
      strongest social cognition performance. Finally, mediation analysis showed that
      activity in the dmPFC subnetwork in response to the social content mediated this 
      relation, suggesting that the simulation of social content in fiction plays a
      role in fiction's ability to enhance readers' social cognition.

TI  - Enhanced emotion regulation capacity and its neural substrates in those exposed
      to moderate childhood adversity.
LID - nsv109 [pii]
AB  - Individuals exposed to childhood adversities (CA) present with emotion regulation
      (ER) difficulties in later life, which have been identified as risk and
      maintenance factors for psychopathologies. However, it is unclear if CA
      negatively impacts on ER capacity per se or whether observed regulation
      difficulties are a function of the challenging circumstances in which ER is being
      deployed. In this longitudinal study, we aimed to clarify this association by
      investigating the behavioral and neural effects of exposure to common moderate CA
      (mCA) on a laboratory measure of ER capacity in late adolescence/young adulthood.
      Our population-derived samples of adolescents/young adults (N = 53) were
      administered a film-based ER-task during functional magnetic resonance imaging
      that allowed evaluation of ER across mCA-exposure. mCA-exposure was associated
      with enhanced ER capacity over both positive and negative affect. At the neural
      level, the better ER of negative material in those exposed to mCA was associated 
      with reduced recruitment of ER-related brain regions, including the prefrontal
      cortex and temporal gyrus. In addition mCA-exposure was associated with a greater
      down-regulation of the amygdala during ER of negative material. The implications 
      of these findings for our understanding of the effects of mCA on the emergence of
      resilience in adolescence are discussed.

TI  - Theory of mind network activity is altered in subjects with familial liability
      for schizophrenia.
LID - nsv111 [pii]
AB  - As evidenced by a multitude of studies, abnormalities in Theory of Mind (ToM) and
      its neural processing might constitute an intermediate phenotype of
      schizophrenia. If so, neural alterations during ToM should be observable in
      unaffected relatives of patients as well, since they share a considerable amount 
      of genetic risk. While behaviorally, impaired ToM function is confirmed
      meta-analytically in relatives, evidence on aberrant function of the neural ToM
      network is sparse and inconclusive. The present study therefore aimed to further 
      explore the neural correlates of ToM in relatives of schizophrenia. About 297
      controls and 63 unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia 
      performed a ToM task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Consistent
      with the literature relatives exhibited decreased activity of the medial
      prefrontal cortex. Additionally, increased recruitment of the right middle
      temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex was found, which was related to
      subclinical paranoid symptoms in relatives. These results further support
      decreased medial prefrontal activation during ToM as an intermediate phenotype of
      genetic risk for schizophrenia. Enhanced recruitment of posterior ToM areas in
      relatives might indicate inefficiency mechanisms in the presence of genetic risk.

TI  - Beyond emotions: A meta-analysis of neural response within face processing system
      in social anxiety.
LID - 1535370215603514 [pii]
AB  - Patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) experience anxiety and avoidance in
      face-to-face interactions. We performed a meta-analysis of functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in SAD to provide a comprehensive understanding 
      of the neural underpinnings of face perception in this disorder. To this purpose,
      we adopted an innovative approach, asking authors for unpublished data. This is a
      common procedure for behavioral meta-analyses, which, however has never been used
      in neuroimaging studies. We searched Pubmed with the key words "Social Anxiety
      AND faces" and "Social Phobia AND faces." Then, we selected those fMRI studies
      for which we were able to obtain data for the comparison between SAD and healthy 
      controls (HC) in a face perception task, either from the published papers or from
      the authors themselves. In this way, we obtained 23 studies (totaling 449 SAD and
      424 HC individuals). We identified significant clusters in which faces evoked a
      higher response in SAD in bilateral amygdala, globus pallidus, superior temporal 
      sulcus, visual cortex, and prefrontal cortex. We also found a higher activity for
      HC in the lingual gyrus and in the posterior cingulate. Our findings show that
      altered neural response to face in SAD is not limited to emotional structures but
      involves a complex network. These results may have implications for the
      understanding of SAD pathophysiology, as they suggest that a dysfunctional face
      perception process may bias patient person-to-person interactions.

AB  - Although most people consider gambling as a recreational activity, some
      individuals lose control over their behavior and enter a spiral of compulsive
      gambling leading to dramatic consequences. In its most severe form, pathological 
      gambling is considered a behavioral addiction sharing many similarities with
      substance addiction. A number of neurobiological hypotheses have been
      investigated in the past ten years, relying mostly on neuroimaging techniques.
      Similarly to substance addiction, a number of observations indicate a central
      role for dopamine in pathological gambling. However, the underlying mechanism
      seems partly different and is still poorly understood. Neuropsychological studies
      have shown decision-making and behavioral inhibition deficits in pathological
      gamblers, likely reflecting frontal lobe dysfunction. Finally, functional MRI
      studies have revealed abnormal reactivity within the brain reward system,
      including the striatum and ventro-medial prefrontal cortex. These regions are
      over-activated by gambling cues, and under-activated by monetary gains. However, 
      the scarcity and heterogeneity of brain imaging studies currently hinder the
      development of a coherent neurobiological model of pathological gambling. Further
      replications of results and diversification of approaches will be needed in the
      coming years in order to strengthen our current model.

TI  - Structural and Functional Alterations in Right Dorsomedial Prefrontal and Left

      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e0136553
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0136553 [doi]
AB  - Recent neuroimaging work has suggested that aggressive behaviour (AB) is
      associated with structural and functional brain abnormalities in processes
      subserving emotion processing and regulation. However, most neuroimaging studies 
      on AB to date only contain relatively small sample sizes. To objectively
      investigate the consistency of previous structural and functional research in
      adolescent AB, we performed a systematic literature review and two
      coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses on eight VBM and 
      nine functional neuroimaging studies in a total of 783 participants (408
      [224AB/184 controls] and 375 [215 AB/160 controls] for structural and functional 
      analysis respectively). We found 19 structural and eight functional foci of
      significant alterations in adolescents with AB, mainly located within the emotion
      processing and regulation network (including orbitofrontal, dorsomedial
      prefrontal and limbic cortex). A subsequent conjunction analysis revealed that
      functional and structural alterations co-localize in right dorsomedial prefrontal
      cortex and left insula. Our results are in line with meta-analytic work as well
      as structural, functional and connectivity findings to date, all of which make a 
      strong point for the involvement of a network of brain areas responsible for
      emotion processing and regulation, which is disrupted in AB. Increased knowledge 
      about the behavioural and neuronal underpinnings of AB is crucial for the
      development of novel and implementation of existing treatment strategies.
      Longitudinal research studies will have to show whether the observed alterations 
      are a result or primary cause of the phenotypic characteristics in AB.

TI  - Gray Matter Volume Reduction Is Associated with Cognitive Impairment in
      Neuromyelitis Optica.
PG  - 1822-9
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A4403 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Whether gray matter impairment occurs in neuromyelitis
      optica is a matter of ongoing debate, and the association of gray matter
      impairment with cognitive deficits remains largely unknown. The purpose of this
      study was to investigate gray matter volume reductions and their association with
      cognitive decline in patients with neuromyelitis optica. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      This study included 50 patients with neuromyelitis optica and 50 sex-, age-,
      handedness-, and education-matched healthy subjects who underwent high-resolution
      structural MR imaging examinations and a battery of cognitive assessments. Gray
      matter volume and cognitive differences were compared between the 2 groups. The
      correlations of the regional gray matter volume with cognitive scores and
      clinical variables were explored in the patients with neuromyelitis optica.
      RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls (635.9 +/- 51.18 mL), patients with
      neuromyelitis optica (602.8 +/- 51.03 mL) had a 5.21% decrease in the mean gray
      matter volume of the whole brain (P < .001). The significant gray matter volume
      reduction in neuromyelitis optica affected the frontal and temporal cortices and 
      the right thalamus (false discovery rate correction, P < .05). The regional gray 
      matter volumes in the frontal and temporal cortices were negatively correlated
      with disease severity in patients with neuromyelitis optica (Alphasim correction,
      P < .05). Patients with neuromyelitis optica had impairments in memory,
      information processing speed, and verbal fluency (P < .05), which were correlated
      with gray matter volume reductions in the medial prefrontal cortex and thalamus
      (Alphasim correction, P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Gray matter volume reduction is
      present in patients with neuromyelitis optica and is associated with cognitive
      impairment and disease severity in this group.

TI  - Bayesian neural adjustment of inhibitory control predicts emergence of problem
      stimulant use.
PG  - 3413-26
LID - 10.1093/brain/awv246 [doi]
AB  - Bayesian ideal observer models quantify individuals' context- and
      experience-dependent beliefs and expectations about their environment, which
      provides a powerful approach (i) to link basic behavioural mechanisms to neural
      processing; and (ii) to generate clinical predictors for patient populations.
      Here, we focus on (ii) and determine whether individual differences in the neural
      representation of the need to stop in an inhibitory task can predict the
      development of problem use (i.e. abuse or dependence) in individuals
      experimenting with stimulants. One hundred and fifty-seven non-dependent
      occasional stimulant users, aged 18-24, completed a stop-signal task while
      undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. These individuals were
      prospectively followed for 3 years and evaluated for stimulant use and
      abuse/dependence symptoms. At follow-up, 38 occasional stimulant users met
      criteria for a stimulant use disorder (problem stimulant users), while 50 had
      discontinued use (desisted stimulant users). We found that those individuals who 
      showed greater neural responses associated with Bayesian prediction errors, i.e. 
      the difference between actual and expected need to stop on a given trial, in
      right medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, anterior
      insula, and thalamus were more likely to exhibit problem use 3 years later.
      Importantly, these computationally based neural predictors outperformed clinical 
      measures and non-model based neural variables in predicting clinical status. In
      conclusion, young adults who show exaggerated brain processing underlying whether
      to 'stop' or to 'go' are more likely to develop stimulant abuse. Thus, Bayesian
      cognitive models provide both a computational explanation and potential
      predictive biomarkers of belief processing deficits in individuals at risk for
      stimulant addiction.

TI  - Clinical and neural effects of six-week administration of oxytocin on core
      symptoms of autism.
PG  - 3400-12
LID - 10.1093/brain/awv249 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with no
      established pharmacological treatment for its core symptoms. Although previous
      literature has shown that single-dose administration of oxytocin temporally
      mitigates autistic social behaviours in experimental settings, it remains in
      dispute whether such potentially beneficial responses in laboratories can result 
      in clinically positive effects in daily life situations, which are measurable
      only in long-term observations of individuals with the developmental disorder
      undergoing continual oxytocin administration. Here, to address this issue, we
      performed an exploratory, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover
      trial including 20 high-functional adult males with autism spectrum disorder.
      Data obtained from 18 participants who completed the trial showed that 6-week
      intranasal administration of oxytocin significantly reduced autism core symptoms 
      specific to social reciprocity, which was clinically evaluated by Autism
      Diagnostic Observation Scale (P = 0.034, PFDR < 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.78).
      Critically, the improvement of this clinical score was accompanied by
      oxytocin-induced enhancement of task-independent resting-state functional
      connectivity between anterior cingulate cortex and dorso-medial prefrontal cortex
      (rho = -0.60, P = 0.011), which was measured by functional magnetic resonance
      imaging. Moreover, using the same social-judgement task as used in our previous
      single-dose oxytocin trial, we confirmed that the current continual
      administration also significantly mitigated behavioural and neural responses
      during the task, both of which were originally impaired in autistic individuals
      (judgement tendency: P = 0.019, d = 0.62; eye-gaze effect: P = 0.03, d = 0.56;
      anterior cingulate activity: P = 0.00069, d = 0.97; dorso-medial prefrontal
      activity: P = 0.0014, d = 0.92; all, PFDR < 0.05). Furthermore, despite its
      longer administration, these effect sizes of the 6-week intervention were not
      larger than those seen in our previous single-dose intervention. These findings
      not only provide the evidence for clinically beneficial effects of continual
      oxytocin administration on the core social symptoms of autism spectrum disorder
      with suggesting its underlying biological mechanisms, but also highlight the
      necessity to seek optimal regimens of continual oxytocin treatment in future
      studies.media-1vid110.1093/brain/awv249_video_abstractawv249_video_abstract.

TI  - Post-mortem brain analyses of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936: extending lifetime
      cognitive and brain phenotyping to the level of the synapse.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Non-pathological, age-related cognitive decline varies markedly
      between individuals andplaces significant financial and emotional strain on
      people, their families and society as a whole.Understanding the differential
      age-related decline in brain function is critical not only for the development
      oftherapeutics to prolong cognitive health into old age, but also to gain insight
      into pathological ageing suchas Alzheimer's disease. The Lothian Birth Cohort of 
      1936 (LBC1936) comprises a rare group of people forwhom there are childhood
      cognitive test scores and longitudinal cognitive data during older age,
      detailedstructural brain MRI, genome-wide genotyping, and a multitude of other
      biological, psycho-social, andepidemiological data. Synaptic integrity is a
      strong indicator of cognitive health in the human brain;however, until recently, 
      it was prohibitively difficult to perform detailed analyses of synaptic and
      axonalstructure in human tissue sections. We have adapted a novel method of
      tissue preparation at autopsy toallow the study of human synapses from the
      LBC1936 cohort in unprecedented morphological andmolecular detail, using the
      high-resolution imaging techniques of array tomography and electronmicroscopy.
      This allows us to analyze the brain at sub-micron resolution to assess density,
      proteincomposition and health of synapses. Here we present data from the first
      donated LBC1936 brain andcompare our findings to Alzheimer's diseased tissue to
      highlight the differences between healthy andpathological brain ageing. RESULTS: 
      Our data indicates that compared to an Alzheimer's disease patient, the
      cognitively normalLBC1936 participant had a remarkable degree of preservation of 
      synaptic structures. However,morphological and molecular markers of degeneration 
      in areas of the brain associated with cognition(prefrontal cortex, anterior
      cingulate cortex, and superior temporal gyrus) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      novel post-mortem protocol facilitates high-resolution neuropathological analysis
      of the well-characterized LBC1936 cohort, extending phenotyping beyond cognition 
      and in vivo imaging to nowinclude neuropathological changes, at the level of
      single synapses. This approach offers an unprecedentedopportunity to study
      synaptic and axonal integrity during ageing and how it contributes to differences
      in agerelatedcognitive change.

TI  - Structural and functional neural correlates of self-reported attachment in
      healthy adults: evidence for an amygdalar involvement.
AB  - The concept of attachment in long-term interpersonal relationships has been
      linked to relationship outcome and social-emotional health. To date, no
      relationship between the structural properties of the human amygdala and
      attachment in romantic relationships (measured through self-reported attachment
      related anxiety and avoidance) has been described. The aim of the current study
      was to investigate the relationship between amygdala structure as well as
      amygdala structural and functional connectivity and attachment anxiety and
      avoidance. To this end, we collected self-report attachment data on a sample of
      female young adults. We then examined associations between attachment and mean
      diffusivity, fractional anisotropy and resting state functional connectivity MRI 
      (rs-FC) of the amygdala and its white matter connections with the prefrontal
      cortex. We found that lower integrity of the left amygdala was linked with
      attachment avoidance (e.g., being less comfortable in seeking proximity with
      others and depending on others) and that greater structural integrity of the
      uncinate fasciculus was positively associated with avoidance. Lastly, we found
      that stronger rs-FC between the bilateral amygdala and medial prefrontal regions 
      was linked with greater avoidance. Our findings are compatible with and expand
      previous results reported by studies that have taken a task-related fMRI
      approach, furthering our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of
      attachment, and in particular implicating the system formed by amygdala and
      prefrontal areas in the patterns of behavior that regulate emotional proximity in
      romantic relationships. These findings have the potential to further our
      understanding of the affective mechanisms underlying attachment behavior.

TI  - Cortical oxygenation suggests increased effort during cognitive inhibition in
      ecstasy polydrug users.
PG  - 1170-81
LID - 10.1177/0269881115598412 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is understood that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy)
      causes serotonin dysfunction and deficits in executive functioning. When
      investigating executive function, functional neuroimaging allows the
      physiological changes underlying these deficits to be investigated. The present
      study investigated behavioural and brain indices of inhibition in
      ecstasy-polydrug users. METHODS: Twenty ecstasy-polydrug users and 20 drug-naive 
      participants completed an inhibitory control task (Random Letter Generation
      (RLG)) while prefrontal haemodynamic response was assessed using functional near 
      infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). RESULTS: There were no group differences on
      background measures including sleep quality and mood state. There were also no
      behavioural differences between the two groups. However, ecstasy-polydrug users
      displayed significant increases in oxygenated haemoglobin (oxy-Hb) from baseline 
      compared to controls at several voxels relating to areas of the inferior right
      medial prefrontal cortex, as well the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex. Regression analysis revealed that recency of ecstasy use was a
      significant predictor of oxy-Hb increase at two voxels over the right hemisphere 
      after controlling for alcohol and cannabis use indices. CONCLUSION:
      Ecstasy-polydrug users show increased neuronal activation in the prefrontal
      cortex compared to non-users. This is taken to be compensatory
      activation/recruitment of additional resources to attain similar performance
      levels on the task, which may be reversible with prolonged abstinence.

TI  - Meta-analysis of Functional Neuroimaging of Major Depressive Disorder in Youth.
PG  - 1045-53
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.1376 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Despite its high prevalence and morbidity, the underlying neural
      basis of major depressive disorder (MDD) in youth is not well understood.
      OBJECTIVES: To identify in youth diagnosed as having MDD the most reliable neural
      abnormalities reported in existing functional neuroimaging studies and
      characterize their relations with specific psychological dysfunctions. DATA
      SOURCES: Searches were conducted in PubMed and Web of Science to identify
      relevant studies published from November 2006 through February 2015. The current 
      analysis took place from August 21, 2014, to March 28, 2015. STUDY SELECTION: We 
      retained articles that conducted a comparison of youth aged 4 to 24 years
      diagnosed as having MDD and age-matched healthy controls using task-based
      functional magnetic resonance imaging and a voxelwise whole-brain approach. DATA 
      EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We extracted coordinates of brain regions exhibiting
      differential activity in youth with MDD compared with healthy control
      participants. Multilevel kernel density analysis was used to examine voxelwise
      between-group differences throughout the whole brain. Correction for multiple
      comparisons was performed by computing null hypothesis distributions from 10000
      Monte Carlo simulations and calculating the cluster size necessary to obtain the 
      familywise error rate control at P < .05. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Abnormal
      levels of activation in youth diagnosed as having MDD compared with control
      participants during a variety of affective processing and executive functioning
      tasks. RESULTS: Compared with age-matched healthy control participants (n = 274),
      youth with MDD (n = 246) showed reliable patterns of abnormal activation,
      including the following task-general and task-specific effects: hyperactivation
      in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (P < .05) and ventrolateral prefrontal
      cortex (P < .05) and hypoactivation in caudate (P < .01) across aggregated tasks;
      hyperactivation in thalamus (P < .03) and parahippocampal gyrus (P < .003) during
      affective processing tasks; hypoactivation in cuneus (P < .001), dorsal cingulate
      cortex (P < .05), and dorsal anterior insula (P < .05) during executive
      functioning tasks; hypoactivity in posterior insula (P < .005) during positive
      valence tasks; and hyperactivity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (P < .001) and
      superior temporal cortex (P < .003) during negative valence tasks. CONCLUSIONS
      AND RELEVANCE: Altered activations in several distributed brain networks may help
      explain the following seemingly disparate symptoms of MDD in youth:
      hypervigilance toward emotional stimuli from the overactivation of central hubs
      in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus that lead to a cascade of
      other symptoms; ineffective emotion regulation despite increased activation of
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during
      affective processing, which may reverse across development or the clinical
      course; maladaptive rumination and poor executive control from difficulties
      shifting from default mode network activity to task-positive network activity
      during cognitively demanding tasks; and anhedonia from hypoactivation of the
      cuneus and posterior insula during reward processing.

AB  - Grey matter brain networks are disrupted in schizophrenia, but it is still
      unclear at which point during the development of the illness these disruptions
      arise and whether these can be associated with behavioural predictors of
      schizophrenia. We investigated if single-subject grey matter networks were
      disrupted in a sample of people at familial risk of schizophrenia. Single-subject
      grey matter networks were extracted from structural MRI scans of 144 high risk
      subjects, 32 recent-onset patients and 36 healthy controls. The following network
      properties were calculated: size, connectivity density, degree, path length,
      clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality and small world properties. People
      at risk of schizophrenia showed decreased path length and clustering in mostly
      prefrontal and temporal areas. Within the high risk sample, the path length of
      the posterior cingulate cortex and the betweenness centrality of the left
      inferior frontal operculum explained 81% of the variance in schizotypal
      cognitions, which was previously shown to be the strongest behavioural predictor 
      of schizophrenia in the study. In contrast, local grey matter volume measurements
      explained 48% of variance in schizotypy. The present results suggest that
      single-subject grey matter networks can quantify behaviourally relevant
      biological alterations in people at increased risk for schizophrenia before
      disease onset.

TI  - Significance of Non-phase Locked Oscillatory Brain Activity in Response to
      Noxious Stimuli.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although current pain-evoked electroencephalographic (EEG) studies
      provide valuable information regarding human brain regions involved in pain, they
      have mostly considered neuronal responses which oscillate in phase following a
      painful event. In many instances, cortical neurons respond by generating bursts
      of activity that are slightly out of phase from trial-to-trial. These types of
      activity bursts are known as induced brain responses. The significance of induced
      brain responses to pain is still unknown. METHODS: In this study, 23 healthy
      subjects were given both non-painful and painful transcutaneous electrical
      stimulations in separate testing blocks (stimulation strength was kept constant
      within blocks). Subjective intensity was rated using a numerical rating scale,
      while cerebral activity tied to each stimulation was measured using EEG
      recordings. Induced brain responses were identified using a time frequency
      wavelet transform applied to average-removed single trials. RESULTS: Results
      showed a pain-specific burst of induced theta activity occurring between 180 and 
      500 ms post-shock onset. Source current density estimations located this activity
      within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, bilaterally), however, only
      right DLPFC activity predicted a decrease in subjective pain as testing
      progressed. CONCLUSION: This finding suggests that non-phase locked neuronal
      responses in the right DLPFC contribute to the endogenous attenuation of pain
      through time. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents neuroimaging findings
      demonstrating that, in response to pain, non-phase locked bursts of theta
      activity located in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are associated with 
      a progressive decrease in subjective pain intensity, which has potentially
      important implications regarding how humans endogenously control their
      experiences of pain.

TI  - MRI-guided dmPFC-rTMS as a Treatment for Treatment-resistant Major Depressive
      Disorder.
PG  - e53129
LID - 10.3791/53129 [doi]
AB  - Here we outline the protocol for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsal medial
      prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).
      Technicians used a neuronavigation system to process patient MRIs to generate a
      3-dimensional head model. The head model was subsequently used to identify
      patient-specific stimulatory targets. The dmPFC was stimulated daily for 20
      sessions. Stimulation intensity was titrated to address scalp pain associated
      with rTMS. Weekly assessments were conducted on the patients using the Hamilton
      Rating Scale for Depression (HamD17) and Beck Depression Index II (BDI-II).
      Treatment-resistant MDD patients achieved significant improvements on both HAMD
      and BDI-II. Of note, angled, double-cone coil rTMS at 120% resting motor
      threshold allows for optimal stimulation of deeper midline prefrontal regions,
      which results in a possible therapeutic application for MDD. One major limitation
      of the rTMS field is the heterogeneity of treatment parameters across studies,
      including duty cycle, number of pulses per session and intensity. Further work
      should be done to clarify the effect of stimulation parameters on outcome. Future
      dmPFC-rTMS work should include sham-controlled studies to confirm its clinical
      efficacy in MDD.

AB  - Recent developments in graph theory have heightened the need for investigating
      the disruptions in the topological structure of functional brain network in major
      depressive disorder (MDD). In this study, we employed resting-state functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and graph theory to examine the whole-brain
      functional networks among 42 MDD patients and 42 healthy controls. Our results
      showed that compared with healthy controls, MDD patients showed higher local
      efficiency and modularity. Furthermore, MDD patients showed altered nodal
      centralities of many brain regions, including hippocampus, temporal cortex,
      anterior cingulate gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal gyrus, mainly located in
      default mode network and cognitive control network. Together, our results
      suggested that MDD was associated with disruptions in the topological structure
      of functional brain networks, and provided new insights concerning the
      pathophysiological mechanisms of MDD.

TI  - Visual working memory representations are distributed throughout human cortex.
PG  - 1115
LID - 10.1167/15.12.1115 [doi]
AB  - Visual working memory (WM) enables the representation and manipulation of
      fleeting visual information. Invasive neurophysiological recordings and human
      neuroimaging studies have revealed sustained increases in neural activity (e.g., 
      single- and multiunit firing rates) and/or activation (e.g., the amplitude of the
      blood-oxygenation-level-dependent response) within a network of prefrontal,
      parietal, and inferotemporal cortical regions during WM storage, but it is
      unclear whether these responses encode memoranda or instead reflect top down
      signals that coordinate storage in posterior sensory areas. To examine these
      alternatives, we asked participants to remember and recall the precise
      orientation of a lateralized grating after a 10 second blank delay. Using fMRI
      and an orientation encoding model, we were able to reconstruct spatially global
      representations of a remembered - but not a forgotten - orientation within
      multiple subregions of retinotopically organized visual and inferior parietal
      cortex (e.g., Ester et al., VSS 2014). Next, we used this method to explore
      putative representations of the remembered orientation across regions of frontal,
      parietal, and temporal cortex (identified using general linear model-based
      localizers and/or a roving searchlight analysis). We obtained robust
      representations of a remembered - but not a forgotten - orientation across a
      distributed network of frontal and parietal cortical regions, including (but not 
      limited to) bilateral inferior and superior parietal lobule (IPL), bilateral
      medial and inferior frontal gyri (IFG), bilateral cingulate cortex, and bilateral
      inferior temporal gyri (ITG). Moreover, trial-by-trial fluctuations in the
      relative "quality" of reconstructions observed in visual cortex as well as a set 
      of left-lateralized frontoparietal and temporal ROIs (e.g., MFG, ITG) were
      robustly correlated with fluctuations in memory performance. These results
      suggest that WM representations are encoded and represented by a diffuse network 
      of posterior sensory and anterior multimodal cortical areas. Meeting abstract
      presented at VSS 2015.

TI  - Neural Responses to Truth Telling and Risk Propensity under Asymmetric
      Information.
PG  - e0137014
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0137014 [doi]
AB  - Trust is multi-dimensional because it can be characterized by subjective trust,
      trust antecedent, and behavioral trust. Previous research has investigated
      functional brain responses to subjective trust (e.g., a judgment of
      trustworthiness) or behavioral trust (e.g., decisions to trust) in perfect
      information, where all relevant information is available to all participants. In 
      contrast, we conducted a novel examination of the patterns of functional brain
      activity to a trust antecedent, specifically truth telling, in asymmetric
      information, where one individual has more information than others, with the
      effect of varying risk propensity. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) and recruited 13 adults, who played the Communication Game, where they
      served as the "Sender" and chose either truth telling (true advice) or lie
      telling (false advice) regarding the best payment allocation for their partner.
      Our behavioral results revealed that subjects with recreational high risk tended 
      to choose true advice. Moreover, fMRI results yielded that the choices of true
      advice were associated with increased cortical activation in the anterior rostral
      medial and frontopolar prefrontal cortices, middle frontal cortex,
      temporoparietal junction, and precuneus. Furthermore, when we specifically
      evaluated a role of the bilateral amygdala as the region of interest (ROI),
      decreased amygdala response was associated with high risk propensity, regardless 
      of truth telling or lying. In conclusion, our results have implications for how
      differential functions of the cortical areas may contribute to the neural
      processing of truth telling.

TI  - SKA2 methylation is associated with decreased prefrontal cortical thickness and
      greater PTSD severity among trauma-exposed veterans.
LID - 10.1038/mp.2015.134 [doi]
AB  - Methylation of the SKA2 (spindle and kinetochore-associated complex subunit 2)
      gene has recently been identified as a promising biomarker of suicide risk. Based
      on this finding, we examined associations between SKA2 methylation, cortical
      thickness and psychiatric phenotypes linked to suicide in trauma-exposed
      veterans. About 200 trauma-exposed white non-Hispanic veterans of the recent
      conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan (91% male) underwent clinical assessment and
      had blood drawn for genotyping and methylation analysis. Of all, 145 participants
      also had neuroimaging data available. Based on previous research, we examined DNA
      methylation at the cytosine-guanine locus cg13989295 as well as DNA methylation
      adjusted for genotype at the methylation-associated single nucleotide
      polymorphism (rs7208505) in relationship to whole-brain cortical thickness,
      posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD) and depression symptoms.
      Whole-brain vertex-wise analyses identified three clusters in prefrontal cortex
      that were associated with genotype-adjusted SKA2 DNA methylation
      (methylationadj). Specifically, DNA methylationadj was associated with bilateral 
      reductions of cortical thickness in frontal pole and superior frontal gyrus, and 
      similar effects were found in the right orbitofrontal cortex and right inferior
      frontal gyrus. PTSD symptom severity was positively correlated with SKA2 DNA
      methylationadj and negatively correlated with cortical thickness in these
      regions. Mediation analyses showed a significant indirect effect of PTSD on
      cortical thickness via SKA2 methylation status. Results suggest that DNA
      methylationadj of SKA2 in blood indexes stress-related psychiatric phenotypes and
      neurobiology, pointing to its potential value as a biomarker of stress exposure
      and susceptibility.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 1 September

      ALE analyses were performed to assess creativity in different cognitive domains
      (Musical, Verbal, and Visuo-spatial). The general ALE revealed that creativity
      relies on clusters of activations in the bilateral occipital, parietal, frontal, 
      and temporal lobes. The individual ALE revealed different maximal activation in
      different domains. Musical creativity yields activations in the bilateral medial 
      frontal gyrus, in the left cingulate gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and inferior
      parietal lobule and in the right postcentral and fusiform gyri. Verbal creativity
      yields activations mainly located in the left hemisphere, in the prefrontal
      cortex, middle and superior temporal gyri, inferior parietal lobule, postcentral 
      and supramarginal gyri, middle occipital gyrus, and insula. The right inferior
      frontal gyrus and the lingual gyrus were also activated. Visuo-spatial creativity
      activates the right middle and inferior frontal gyri, the bilateral thalamus and 
      the left precentral gyrus. This evidence suggests that creativity relies on
      multi-componential neural networks and that different creativity domains depend
      on different brain regions.

AB  - Higher cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with better cognitive performance 
      and enhanced brain activation. Yet, the extent to which cardiorespiratory
      fitness-related brain activation is associated with better cognitive performance 
      is not well understood. In this cross-sectional study, we examined whether the
      association between cardiorespiratory fitness and executive function was mediated
      by greater prefrontal cortex activation in healthy older adults. Brain activation
      was measured during dual-task performance with functional magnetic resonance
      imaging in a sample of 128 healthy older adults (59-80 years). Higher
      cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with greater activation during dual-task
      processing in several brain areas including the anterior cingulate and
      supplementary motor cortex (ACC/SMA), thalamus and basal ganglia, right
      motor/somatosensory cortex and middle frontal gyrus, and left somatosensory
      cortex, controlling for age, sex, education, and gray matter volume. Of these
      regions, greater ACC/SMA activation mediated the association between
      cardiorespiratory fitness and dual-task performance. We provide novel evidence
      that cardiorespiratory fitness may support cognitive performance by facilitating 
      brain activation in a core region critical for executive function.

AB  - There is increasing evidence for disturbances within the glutamate system in
      patients with affective disorders, which involve disruptions of the
      glutamate-glutamine-cycle. The mainly astroglia-located enzyme glutamine
      synthetase (GS) catalyzes the ATP-dependent condensation of ammonia and glutamate
      to form glutamine, thus playing a central role in glutamate and glutamine
      homoeostasis. However, GS is also expressed in numerous oligodendrocytes (OLs),
      another class of glial cells implicated in mood disorder pathology. To learn more
      about the role of glia-associated GS in mental illnesses, we decided to find out 
      if numerical densities of glial cells immunostained for the enzyme protein differ
      between subjects with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder (BD), and
      psychically healthy control cases. Counting of GS expressing astrocytes (ACs) and
      OLs in eight cortical and two subcortical brain regions of subjects with mood
      disorder (N = 14), BD (N = 15), and controls (N = 16) revealed that in major
      depression the densities of ACs were significantly reduced in some cortical but
      not subcortical gray matter areas, whereas no changes were found for OLs. In BD
      no alterations of GS-immunoreactive glia were found. From our findings we
      conclude that (1) GS expressing ACs are prominently involved in glutamate-related
      disturbances in major depression, but not in BD and (2) GS expressing OLs, though
      being present in significant numbers in prefrontal cortical areas, play a minor
      (if any) role in mood disorder pathology. The latter assumption is supported by
      findings of others showing that - at least in the mouse brain cortex - GS
      immunoreactive oligodendroglial cells are unable to contribute to the
      glutamate-glutamine-cycle due to the complete lack of amino acid transporters
      (Takasaki et al., 2010).

AB  - Neuroticism is a dimension of personality that captures trait individual
      differences in the tendency to experience negative thoughts and feelings.
      Established theories explain neuroticism in terms of threat sensitivity, but have
      limited heuristic value since they cannot account for features of neuroticism
      that are unrelated to threat, such as creativity and negative psychological
      states experienced in benign, threat-free environments. We address this issue by 
      proposing that neuroticism stems from trait individual differences in activity in
      brain circuits that govern the nature of self-generated thought (SGT). We argue
      our theory explains not only the association of neuroticism with threat
      sensitivity but also the prominence within the neurotic mind of representations
      of information that are unrelated to the way the world is right now, such as
      creativity and nonsituational 'angst'.

AB  - The ability to overcome distraction is critical to a number of goal-directed
      behaviors, but information that is not relevant to our goals often captures our
      attention and distracts us from the task at hand. Neuroimaging work has
      demonstrated that activity in specific regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) is related to the suppression of distracting information, implicating PFC
      as a critical node in the goal-directed control network. In the current work we
      asked whether applying transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) to PFC
      would influence the likelihood of attentional capture by salient, task-irrelevant
      visual information encountered during visual search. Our results showed that
      anodal stimulation, relative to sham or cathodal stimulation, led to a transient 
      decrease in attentional capture lasting approximately 15min after stimulation.
      This provides causal evidence that PFC is involved in goal-directed control over 
      distraction, and provides a basis for using PFC stimulation as a causal tool to
      understand deficits in goal-directed control in both neurologically healthy and
      impaired populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In view of the greater prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders
      in women than in men, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have
      examined sex-differences in brain activations during emotion processing.
      Comparatively, sex-differences in brain connectivity received little attention,
      despite evidence for important fronto-limbic connections during emotion
      processing across sexes. Here, we investigated sex-differences in fronto-limbic
      connectivity during negative emotion processing. METHODS: Forty-six healthy
      individuals (25 women, 21 men) viewed negative, positive and neutral images
      during an fMRI session. Effective connectivity between significantly activated
      regions was examined using Granger causality and psychophysical interaction
      analyses. Sex steroid hormones and feminine-masculine traits were also measured. 
      RESULTS: Subjective ratings of negative emotional images were higher in women
      than in men. Across sexes, significant activations were observed in the
      dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the right amygdala. Granger
      connectivity from right amygdala was significantly greater than that from dmPFC
      during the 'high negative' condition, an effect driven by men. Magnitude of this 
      effect correlated negatively with highly negative image ratings and feminine
      traits and positively with testosterone levels. DISCUSSION: These results
      highlight critical sex differences in brain connectivity during negative emotion 
      processing and point to the fact that both biological (sex steroid hormones) and 
      psychosocial (gender role and identity) variables contribute to them. As the
      dmPFC is involved in social cognition and action planning, and the amygdala-in
      threat detection, the connectivity results suggest that compared to women, men
      have a more evaluative, rather than purely affective, brain response during
      negative emotion processing.

AB  - Age-related cognitive changes often include difficulties in retrieving memories, 
      particularly those that rely on personal experiences within their temporal and
      spatial contexts (i.e., episodic memories). This decline may vary depending on
      the studied phase (i.e., encoding, storage or retrieval), according to
      inter-individual differences, and whether we are talking about normal or
      pathological (e.g., Alzheimer disease; AD) aging. Such cognitive changes are
      associated with different structural and functional alterations in the human
      neural network that underpins episodic memory. The prefrontal cortex is the first
      structure to be affected by age, followed by the medial temporal lobe (MTL), the 
      parietal cortex and the cerebellum. In AD, however, the modifications occur
      mainly in the MTL (hippocampus and adjacent structures) before spreading to the
      neocortex. In this review, we will present results that attempt to characterize
      normal and pathological cognitive aging at multiple levels by integrating
      structural, behavioral, inter-individual and neuroimaging measures of episodic
      memory.

AB  - Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often complain of doubt
      related to memory. As neuropsychological research has demonstrated that
      individuals with OCD tend to focus on details and miss the larger context, the
      construct of source (contextual) memory may be particularly relevant to memory
      complaints in OCD. Memory for object versus contextual information relies on
      partially distinct regions within the prefrontal cortex, parietal and medial
      temporal lobe, and may be differentially impacted by OCD. In the present study,
      we sought to test the hypothesis that individuals with OCD exhibit impaired
      source memory retrieval using a novel memory paradigm - The Memory for Rooms Test
      (MFRT) - a four-room memory task in which participants walk through four rooms
      and attempt to encode and remember objects. Demographically matched individuals
      with OCD and healthy controls studied objects in the context of four rooms, and
      then completed a memory retrieval test while undergoing functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI). While no differences were observed in source memory
      accuracy, individuals with OCD exhibited greater task related activation in the
      posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) relative to healthy controls during correct
      source memory retrieval. During correct object recognition, individuals with OCD 
      failed to recruit the dorsolateral prefrontal(DLPFC)/premotor, left mPFC, and
      right parietal regions to the same extent as healthy controls. Our results
      suggest abnormal recruitment of frontal-parietal and PCC regions during source
      verses object memory retrieval in OCD. Within the OCD group, activation in the
      PCC and the premotor/DLPFC was associated with greater pathological doubt. This
      finding is consistent with the observation that OCD patients often experience
      extreme doubt, even when memory performance is intact.

AB  - Human decisions are guided by a variety of motivational factors, such as
      immediate rewards, long-term goals, and emotions. We used functional magnetic
      resonance imaging to investigate the dynamic functional interactions between the 
      amygdala, the nucleus accumbens, and the prefrontal cortex that underlie the
      influences of emotions, desires, and rationality on human decisions. We found
      that increased functional connectivity between the amygdala and the nucleus
      accumbens facilitated the approach of an immediate reward in the presence of
      emotional information. Further, increased functional interactions of the
      anteroventral prefrontal cortex with the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens were 
      associated with rational decisions in dilemma situations. These findings support 
      previous animal studies by demonstrating that emotional signals from the amygdala
      and goal-oriented information from prefrontal cortices interface in the nucleus
      accumbens to guide human decisions and reward-directed actions.

TI  - Predictors of poor treatment response to additional CBT in real panic disorder
      patients: The role of DLPF, orbitofrontal cortex, parietal lobule, frontal eye
      field and amygdala in PD.
PG  - 269-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous functional brain imaging studies have described various and
      contradictory activation findings in patients with panic disorder (PD). Our study
      focused on patients with a chronic PD, who were investigated and treated in a
      conventional manner, which represents the real PD patients in clinical practice. 
      METHODS: Continuing their medication, patients were included in a six-week
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program in the psychiatry department. At the
      onset of the study, participants underwent clinical evaluation using standard
      scales and were examined using fMRI while listening to verbal threat-related
      stimuli contrasted to neutral words. According to the therapeutic outcome, they
      were subsequently divided into two groups, responders, and nonresponders and the 
      two groups were mutually compared. RESULTS: In non-responders compared to
      responders, we found increased pre-treatment activation in dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex bilaterally, left orbitofrontal cortex, left frontal eye field,
      right parietal lobule and left amygdala. In addition, both groups showed negative
      fMRI BOLD correlation with BAI improvement and positive correlation with CGI
      improvement across the ROIs. We suggest that DLPFC over-activation may reveal a
      lack of cognitive control over emotional processing, which makes subsequent CBT
      less effective. CONCLUSION: Despite several limitations, we found neuroimaging
      predictors of poor CBT response, under the conditions of standard clinical
      practice, in real PD patients.

TI  - The Contingency of Cocaine Administration Accounts for Structural and Functional 
      Medial Prefrontal Deficits and Increased Adrenocortical Activation.
PG  - 11897-910
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4961-14.2015 [doi]
AB  - The prelimbic region (PL) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is implicated in
      the relapse of drug-seeking behavior. Optimal mPFC functioning relies on synaptic
      connections involving dendritic spines in pyramidal neurons, whereas prefrontal
      dysfunction resulting from elevated glucocorticoids, stress, aging, and mental
      illness are each linked to decreased apical dendritic branching and spine density
      in pyramidal neurons in these cortical fields. The fact that cocaine use induces 
      activation of the stress-responsive hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis raises the
      possibility that cocaine-related impairments in mPFC functioning may be
      manifested by similar changes in neuronal architecture in mPFC. Nevertheless,
      previous studies have generally identified increases, rather than decreases, in
      structural plasticity in mPFC after cocaine self-administration. Here, we use 3D 
      imaging and analysis of dendritic spine morphometry to show that chronic cocaine 
      self-administration leads to mild decreases of apical dendritic branching,
      prominent dendritic spine attrition in PL pyramidal neurons, and working memory
      deficits. Importantly, these impairments were largely accounted for in groups of 
      rats that self-administered cocaine compared with yoked-cocaine- and
      saline-matched counterparts. Follow-up experiments failed to demonstrate any
      effects of either experimenter-administered cocaine or food self-administration
      on structural alterations in PL neurons. Finally, we verified that the cocaine
      self-administration group was distinguished by more protracted increases in
      adrenocortical activity compared with yoked-cocaine- and saline-matched controls.
      These studies suggest a mechanism whereby increased adrenocortical activity
      resulting from chronic cocaine self-administration may contribute to regressive
      prefrontal structural and functional plasticity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Stress, 
      aging, and mental illness are each linked to decreased prefrontal plasticity.
      Here, we show that chronic cocaine self-administration in rats leads to
      decrements in medial prefrontal structural and functional plasticity. Notably,
      these impairments were largely accounted for in rats that self-administered
      cocaine compared with yoked counterparts. Moreover, we verified previous reports 
      showing that adrenocortical output is augmented by cocaine administration and is 
      more protracted in rats that were permitted to receive the drug contingently
      instead of passively. These studies suggest that increased adrenocortical
      activity resulting from cocaine self-administration may contribute to regressive 
      prefrontal structural and functional plasticity.

TI  - Abnormal prefrontal cortex resting state functional connectivity and severity of 
      internet gaming disorder.
AB  - Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) among adolescents has become an important public
      concern and gained more and more attention internationally. Recent studies
      focused on IGD and revealed brain abnormalities in the IGD group, especially the 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, the role of PFC-striatal circuits in pathology 
      of IGD remains unknown. Twenty-five adolescents with IGD and 21 age- and
      gender-matched healthy controls were recruited in our study. Voxel-based
      morphometric (VBM) and functional connectivity analysis were employed to
      investigate the abnormal structural and resting-state properties of several
      frontal regions in individuals with online gaming addiction. Relative to healthy 
      comparison subjects, IGD subjects showed significant decreased gray matter volume
      in PFC regions including the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC),
      orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the right
      supplementary motor area (SMA) after controlling for age and gender effects. We
      chose these regions as the seeding areas for the resting-state analysis and found
      that IGD subjects showed decreased functional connectivity between several
      cortical regions and our seeds, including the insula, and temporal and occipital 
      cortices. Moreover, significant decreased functional connectivity between some
      important subcortical regions, i.e., dorsal striatum, pallidum, and thalamus, and
      our seeds were found in the IGD group and some of those changes were associated
      with the severity of IGD. Our results revealed the involvement of several PFC
      regions and related PFC-striatal circuits in the process of IGD and suggested IGD
      may share similar neural mechanisms with substance dependence at the circuit
      level.

AB  - Cognitive emotion regulation is a powerful way of modulating emotional responses.
      However, despite the vital role of emotions in learning, it is unknown whether
      the effect of cognitive emotion regulation also extends to the modulation of
      learning. Computational models indicate prediction error activity, typically
      observed in the striatum and ventral tegmental area, as a critical neural
      mechanism involved in associative learning. We used model-based fMRI during
      aversive conditioning with and without cognitive emotion regulation to test the
      hypothesis that emotion regulation would affect prediction error-related neural
      activity in the striatum and ventral tegmental area, reflecting an emotion
      regulation-related modulation of learning. Our results show that cognitive
      emotion regulation reduced emotion-related brain activity, but increased
      prediction error-related activity in a network involving ventral tegmental area, 
      hippocampus, insula and ventral striatum. While the reduction of response
      activity was related to behavioral measures of emotion regulation success, the
      enhancement of prediction error-related neural activity was related to learning
      performance. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the ventral tegmental
      area and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, an area involved in regulation, was
      specifically increased during emotion regulation and likewise related to learning
      performance. Our data, therefore, provide first-time evidence that beyond
      reducing emotional responses, cognitive emotion regulation affects learning by
      enhancing prediction error-related activity, potentially via tegmental
      dopaminergic pathways.

AB  - Repeated exposure to Group-A beta-Haemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) may constitute a
      vulnerability factor in the onset and course of pediatric motor disturbances. GAS
      infections/colonization can stimulate the production of antibodies, which may
      cross the blood brain barrier, target selected brain areas (e.g. basal ganglia), 
      and exacerbate motor alterations. Here, we exposed developing SJL male mice to
      four injections with a GAS homogenate and evaluated the following domains: motor 
      coordination; general locomotion; repetitive behaviors; perseverative responses; 
      and sensorimotor gating (pre-pulse inhibition, PPI). To demonstrate that
      behavioral changes were associated with immune-mediated brain alterations, we
      analyzed, in selected brain areas, the presence of infiltrates and microglial
      activation (immunohistochemistry), monoamines (HPLC), and brain metabolites (in
      vivo Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy). GAS-exposed mice showed increased
      repetitive and perseverative behaviors, impaired PPI, and reduced concentrations 
      of serotonin in prefrontal cortex, a brain area linked to the behavioral domains 
      investigated, wherein they also showed remarkable elevations in lactate. Active
      inflammatory processes were substantiated by the observation of infiltrates and
      microglial activation in the white matter of the anterior diencephalon. These
      data support the hypothesis that repeated GAS exposure may elicit inflammatory
      responses in brain areas involved in motor control and perseverative behavior,
      and result in phenotypic abnormalities.

TI  - Reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration is associated with physical
      disability in progressive multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 2584-95
LID - 10.1093/brain/awv209 [doi]
AB  - Neurodegeneration is thought to be the major cause of ongoing, irreversible
      disability in progressive stages of multiple sclerosis. Gamma-aminobutyric acid
      is the principle inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. The aims of this study
      were to investigate if gamma-aminobutyric acid levels (i) are abnormal in
      patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis compared with healthy
      controls; and (ii) correlate with physical and cognitive performance in this
      patient population. Thirty patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis
      and 17 healthy control subjects underwent single-voxel MEGA-PRESS
      (MEscher-GArwood Point RESolved Spectroscopy) magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 
      3 T, to quantify gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in the prefrontal cortex, right
      hippocampus and left sensorimotor cortex. All subjects were assessed clinically
      and underwent a cognitive assessment. Multiple linear regression models were used
      to compare differences in gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations between patients
      and controls adjusting for age, gender and tissue fractions within each
      spectroscopic voxel. Regression was used to examine the relationships between the
      cognitive function and physical disability scores specific for these regions with
      gamma-aminobuytric acid levels, adjusting for age, gender, and total
      N-acetyl-aspartate and glutamine-glutamate complex levels. When compared with
      controls, patients performed significantly worse on all motor and sensory tests, 
      and were cognitively impaired in processing speed and verbal memory. Patients had
      significantly lower gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in the hippocampus (adjusted
      difference = -0.403 mM, 95% confidence intervals -0.792, -0.014, P = 0.043) and
      sensorimotor cortex (adjusted difference = -0.385 mM, 95% confidence intervals
      -0.667, -0.104, P = 0.009) compared with controls. In patients, reduced motor
      function in the right upper and lower limb was associated with lower
      gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration in the sensorimotor cortex. Specifically
      for each unit decrease in gamma-aminobutyric acid levels (in mM), there was a
      predicted -10.86 (95% confidence intervals -16.786 to -4.482) decrease in grip
      strength (kg force) (P < 0.001) and -8.74 (95% confidence intervals -13.943 to
      -3.015) decrease in muscle strength (P < 0.006). This study suggests that reduced
      gamma-aminobutyric acid levels reflect pathological abnormalities that may play a
      role in determining physical disability. These abnormalities may include
      decreases in the pre- and postsynaptic components of gamma-aminobutyric acid
      neurotransmission and in the density of inhibitory neurons. Additionally, the
      reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration may contribute to the
      neurodegenerative process, resulting in increased firing of axons, with
      consequent increased energy demands, which may lead to neuroaxonal degeneration
      and loss of the compensatory mechanisms that maintain motor function. This study 
      supports the idea that modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission
      may be an important target for neuroprotection in multiple sclerosis.See De
      Stefano and Giorgio (doi:10.1093/brain/awv213) for a scientific commentary on
      this article.

TI  - Is the Medial Prefrontal Cortex Necessary for Theory of Mind?
PG  - e0135912
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0135912 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Successful social interaction relies on the ability to attribute
      mental states to other people. Previous functional neuroimaging studies have
      shown that this process, described as Theory of Mind (ToM) or mentalization, is
      reliably associated with activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).
      However, this study presents a novel and surprising finding that provides new
      insight into the role of the mPFC in mentalization tasks. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
      FINDINGS: Twenty healthy individuals were recruited from a wide range of ages and
      social backgrounds. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) while viewing a well-established ToM visual paradigm involving moving
      triangles. Functional MRI data were analyzed using a classical general linear
      model. No activation was detected in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during
      movement patterns that typically elicit ToM. However, increased activity was
      observed in the right middle occipital gyrus, right temporoparietal junction
      (TPJ), left middle occipital gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus. No
      correlation was found between participants' age and BOLD response.
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In contrast with previous neuroimaging research, our
      findings support the notion that mPFC function is not critical for reasoning
      about the mental states of others; furthermore, our data indicate that the right 
      TPJ and right inferior frontal gyrus are able to perform mentalization without
      any contributions from the mPFC.

TI  - Dopamine and glutamate release in the anterior default system during rest: A
      monkey microdialysis study.

AB  - Human neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the presence of a default system in 
      the brain, which shows a default mode of brain activity, i.e., greater activity
      during rest than during an attention-demanding cognitive task. Our previous study
      on monkeys has revealed a default mode of brain activity in medial cortical
      areas. We have observed an increase in dopamine (DA) release during a working
      memory (WM) task compared with that during rest in the monkey lateral prefrontal 
      cortex (LPFC). However, no previous study has examined DA release related to the 
      default mode of brain activity. We used a microdialysis technique to investigate 
      changes in DA release in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), which constitutes
      the anterior default system, during the WM task and rest. Because DA and
      glutamate (Glu) release in the LPFC is interrelated, we also examined Glu release
      in the MPFC. We observed a significant increase in DA release, but no significant
      change in Glu release during rest compared with that during the WM task. We also 
      observed an inhibitory relationship between the two transmitters in the MPFC.
      Considering that human default brain activity is related to internal thought
      processes and increased DA release in the LPFC plays an important role in
      executive control, increase in DA release during rest in the monkey anterior
      default system may be related to some form of internal thought process.

LID - S0166-4328(15)30147-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.bbr.2015.08.014 [doi]
AB  - Growing evidence has indicated a potential connection between resting-state
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) signal and cognitive performance.
      However, the relationship between intrinsic neural activity and behavioral
      interference effect on cognitive control has been poorly understood. In the
      present study, seventy-eight healthy subjects underwent RS-fMRI and performed
      Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT). The fractional amplitude of low-frequency 
      fluctuation (fALFF) was measured as an indicator of intrinsic brain activity. The
      difference in reaction times between interference and control conditions in MSIT 
      was evaluated as interference effect. Then we examined the associations between
      fALFF and interference effect using partial correlation analysis controlling for 
      age, gender and mean framewise displacement. The results demonstrated that fALFF 
      values in orbital prefrontal cortex (OPFC) and right inferior frontal cortex
      (IFC) were negatively correlated with the interference effect in MSIT. The
      findings manifest that OPFC and right IFC may influence the processing efficiency
      of cognitive conflict and play a crucial role in cognitive control.

AB  - The most anterior portion of prefrontal cortex (aPFC), more specifically Brodman 
      Area 10 (BA10), has been implicated in 'branching operations', or the ability to 
      perform tasks related to one goal, while keeping in working memory information
      related to a secondary goal. Such findings have been based on fMRI recordings
      under complex behavioral paradigms that compare 'branching' tasks with tasks
      where one goal is pursued at a time, but are limited by their complete reliance
      on verbal working memory and by small sample sizes. Here, we test the specificity
      of BA 10 to branching in similar behavioral paradigms but with a larger sample
      and in two different conditions involving verbal and visual working memory
      respectively. We find that BA 10 and other frontal and parietal brain areas are
      activated in all tasks, with an extent and level of significance increasing with 
      the complexity of the task. We conclude that the activation of BA 10 is not
      specific to branching as previously hypothesized, but is related to the level of 
      complexity of working memory performance. For further insight into the specific
      role of anterior portions of the frontal cortex we highlight the importance of
      simple control tasks with gradual and incremental increase in complexity.

      research.

AB  - Tinnitus is a widespread auditory disorder affecting approximately 10-15% of the 
      population, often with debilitating consequences. Although tinnitus commonly
      begins with damage to the auditory system due to loud-noise exposure, aging, or
      other etiologies, the exact neurophysiological basis of chronic tinnitus remains 
      unknown. Many researchers point to a central auditory origin of tinnitus;
      however, a growing body of evidence also implicates other brain regions,
      including the limbic system. Correspondingly, we and others have proposed models 
      of tinnitus in which the limbic and auditory systems both play critical roles and
      interact with one another. Specifically, we argue that damage to the auditory
      system generates an initial tinnitus signal, consistent with previous research.
      In our model, this "transient" tinnitus is suppressed when a limbic
      frontostriatal network, comprised of ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral
      striatum, successfully modulates thalamocortical transmission in the auditory
      system. Thus, in chronic tinnitus, limbic-system damage and resulting
      inefficiency of auditory-limbic interactions prevents proper compensation of the 
      tinnitus signal. Neuroimaging studies utilizing connectivity methods like
      resting-state fMRI and diffusion MRI continue to uncover tinnitus-related
      anomalies throughout auditory, limbic, and other brain systems. However, directly
      assessing interactions between these brain regions and networks has proved to be 
      more challenging. Here, we review existing empirical support for models of
      tinnitus stressing a critical role for involvement of "non-auditory" structures
      in tinnitus pathophysiology, and discuss the possible impact of newly refined
      connectivity techniques from neuroimaging on tinnitus research.

LID - S1389-9457(15)00785-6 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The right anterior insula (AIns) is an important node of the salience
      network and serves to switch between two major cognitive-related functional brain
      networks, ie, the central executive network (CEN) and the default mode network
      (DMN), both of which show functional deficits in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
      patients. However, the effect of OSA on functional connectivity of the right AIns
      remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the resting-state functional
      connectivity (rsFC) between the right AIns and the CEN and DMN is disrupted in
      OSA patients, which may be associated with cognitive deficits in this disorder.
      METHODS: Twenty-four male OSA patients and 21 matched healthy controls underwent 
      functional MRI examinations and clinical and neuropsychologic assessments. The
      rsFCs between the right AIns and the CEN and DMN were compared between the two
      groups and were correlated with clinical and neuropsychologic assessments.
      RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, OSA patients showed significantly
      weakened rsFC between the right AIns and the DMN. Moreover, the functional
      disconnection between the right AIns and the medial prefrontal cortex was
      correlated with the severity of the OSA; and the functional disconnection between
      the right AIns and the posterior cingulate cortex was correlated with depressive 
      scores and working memory performance. However, there were no significant
      inter-group differences in the rsFC between the right AIns and the CEN.
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that OSA selectively impairs the rsFC between
      the right AIns and the DMN, which may be a candidate substrate for cognitive
      impairment in OSA patients.

AB  - This paper presents a case series with preliminary data regarding the
      neurophysiological effects of specific prayer practices associated with the
      Islamic religion. Such practices, like other prayer practices, are likely
      associated with several coordinated cognitive activities and a complex pattern of
      brain physiology. However, there may also be changes specific to the goals of
      Islamic prayer which has, as its most fundamental concept, the surrendering of
      one's self to God. To evaluate Islamic prayer practices, we measured changes in
      cerebral blood flow (CBF) using single photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT) in three Islamic individuals while practicing two different types of
      Islamic prayer. In this case series, intense Islamic prayer practices generally
      showed decreased CBF in the prefrontal cortex and related frontal lobe
      structures, and the parietal lobes. However, there were also several regions that
      differed between the two types of prayer practices including increased CBF in the
      caudate nucleus, insula, thalamus, and globus pallidus. These patterns also
      appear distinct from concentrative techniques in which an individual focuses on a
      particular idea or object. It is hypothesized that the changes in brain activity 
      may be associated with feelings of "surrender" and "connectedness with God"
      described to be experienced during these intense Islamic prayer practices.
      Overall, these results suggest that several coordinated cognitive processes occur
      during intense Islamic prayer. Methodological issues and implications of the
      results are also discussed.

TI  - The Impact of Accelerated Right Prefrontal High-Frequency Repetitive Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on Cue-Reactivity: An fMRI Study on Craving in
      Recently Detoxified Alcohol-Dependent Patients.
PG  - e0136182
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0136182 [doi]
AB  - In alcohol-dependent patients craving is a difficult-to-treat phenomenon. It has 
      been suggested that high-frequency (HF) repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) may have beneficial effects. However, exactly how this
      application exerts its effect on the underlying craving neurocircuit is currently
      unclear. In an effort to induce alcohol craving and to maximize detection of
      HF-rTMS effects to cue-induced alcohol craving, patients were exposed to a block 
      and event-related alcohol cue-reactivity paradigm while being scanned with fMRI. 
      Hence, we assessed the effect of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
      stimulation on cue-induced and general alcohol craving, and the related craving
      neurocircuit. Twenty-six recently detoxified alcohol-dependent patients were
      included. First, we evaluated the impact of one sham-controlled stimulation
      session. Second, we examined the effect of accelerated right DLPFC HF-rTMS
      treatment: here patients received 15 sessions in an open label accelerated
      design, spread over 4 consecutive days. General craving significantly decreased
      after 15 active HF-rTMS sessions. However, cue-induced alcohol craving was not
      altered. Our brain imaging results did not show that the cue-exposure affected
      the underlying craving neurocircuit after both one and fifteen active HF-rTMS
      sessions. Yet, brain activation changes after one and 15 HF-rTMS sessions,
      respectively, were observed in regions associated with the extended reward system
      and the default mode network, but only during the presentation of the
      event-related paradigm. Our findings indicate that accelerated HF-rTMS applied to
      the right DLPFC does not manifestly affect the craving neurocircuit during an
      alcohol-related cue-exposure, but instead it may influence the attentional
      network.

TI  - Neuroimaging of Fear-Associated Learning.
LID - 10.1038/npp.2015.255 [doi]
AB  - Fear conditioning has been commonly used as a model of emotional learning in
      animals and, with the introduction of functional neuroimaging techniques, has
      proven useful in establishing the neurocircuitry of emotional learning in humans.
      Studies of fear acquisition suggest that regions such as amygdala, insula,
      anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus play an important role in acquisition 
      of fear, whereas studies of fear extinction suggest that the amygdala is also
      crucial for safety learning. Extinction retention testing points to the
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex as an essential region in the recall of the safety
      trace, and explicit learning of fear and safety associations recruits additional 
      cortical and subcortical regions. Importantly, many of these findings have
      implications in our understanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disease. 
      Recent studies using clinical populations have lent insight into the changes in
      regional activity in specific disorders, and treatment studies have shown how
      pharmaceutical and other therapeutic interventions modulate brain activation
      during emotional learning. Finally, research investigating individual differences
      in neurotransmitter receptor genotypes has highlighted the contribution of these 
      systems in fear-associated learning.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online

TI  - Functional disconnection in the prefrontal-amygdala circuitry in unaffected
      siblings of patients with bipolar I disorder.
LID - 10.1111/bdi.12321 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bipolar I disorder (BD) is a highly heritable disorder characterized 
      by mood swings between high-energy and low-energy states. Amygdala hyperactivity 
      and cortical inhibitory hypoactivity [e.g., of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (dlPFC)] have been found in patients with BD, as evidenced by their abnormal
      resting-state functional connectivity (FC) and glucose utilization (GU). However,
      it has not been determined whether functional abnormalities of the dlPFC-amygdala
      circuit exist in unaffected, healthy siblings of the patients with BD (BDsib).
      METHODS: Twenty euthymic patients with BD, 20 unaffected matching BDsib of the
      patient group, and 20 well-matched healthy control subjects were recruited. We
      investigated seed-based FC (seeds: dlPFC) with resting-state functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging and GU in the regions of interest (e.g., dlPFC and amygdala)
      using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. RESULTS: The FC in
      the dlPFC (right)-amygdala circuit was statistically abnormal in patients with BD
      and BDsib, but only the patients with BD demonstrated hypoactive GU bilaterally
      in the dlPFC and hyperactive GU bilaterally in the amygdala. Facilitating
      differentiation between the BD groups, the altered FC between dlPFC (right) and
      amygdala (left) was even more prominent in the patients with BD (p < 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: There was a dysfunctional connection with intact GU in the
      dlPFC-amygdala circuit of the BDsib, which highlights the vulnerability in
      families with BD. Diminished top-down control from the bilateral dlPFC, which
      prevents adequate inhibition of limbic hyperactivity, might mediate the
      development of BD.

AB  - Humans monitor states of uncertainty that can guide decision-making. These
      uncertain states are evident behaviorally when humans decline to make a
      categorization response. Such behavioral uncertainty responses (URs) have also
      defined the search for metacognition in animals. While a plethora of neuroimaging
      studies have focused on uncertainty, the brain systems supporting a volitional
      strategy shift under uncertainty have not been distinguished from those observed 
      in making introspective post-hoc reports of categorization uncertainty. Using
      rapid event-related fMRI, we demonstrate that the neural activity patterns
      elicited by humans' URs are qualitatively different from those recruited by
      associative processes during categorization. Participants performed a
      one-dimensional perceptual-categorization task in which an uncertainty-response
      option let them decline to make a categorization response. Uncertainty responding
      activated a distributed network including prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior and
      posterior cingulate cortex (ACC, PCC), anterior insula, and posterior parietal
      areas; importantly, these regions were distinct from those whose activity was
      modulated by task difficulty. Generally, our results can be characterized as a
      large-scale cognitive control network including recently evolved brain regions
      such as the anterior dorsolateral and medial PFC. A metacognitive theory would
      view the UR as a deliberate behavioral adjustment rather than just a learned
      middle category response, and predicts this pattern of results. These
      neuroimaging results bolster previous behavioral findings, which suggested that
      different cognitive processes underlie responses due to associative learning
      versus the declaration of uncertainty. We conclude that the UR represents an
      elemental behavioral index of metacognition.

TI  - Neural Basis of Psychological Growth following Adverse Experiences: A
      Resting-State Functional MRI Study.
PG  - e0136427
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0136427 [doi]
AB  - Over the past decade, research on the aftereffects of stressful or traumatic
      events has emphasized the negative outcomes from these experiences. However, the 
      positive outcomes deriving from adversity are increasingly being examined, and
      such positive changes are described as posttraumatic growth (PTG). To investigate
      the relationship between basal whole-brain functional connectivity and PTG, we
      employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and analyzed the
      neural networks using independent component analysis in a sample of 33 healthy
      controls. Correlations were calculated between the network connectivity strength 
      and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) score. There were positive
      associations between the PTGI scores and brain activation in the rostral
      prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobule (SPL) within the left central
      executive network (CEN) (respectively, r = 0.41, p < 0.001; r = 0.49, p < 0.001).
      Individuals with higher psychological growth following adverse experiences had
      stronger activation in prospective or working memory areas within the executive
      function network than did individuals with lower psychological growth (r = 0.40, 
      p < 0.001). Moreover, we found that individuals with higher PTG demonstrated
      stronger connectivity between the SPL and supramarginal gyrus (SMG). The SMG is
      one of the brain regions associated with the ability to reason about the mental
      states of others, otherwise known as mentalizing. These findings suggest that
      individuals with higher psychological growth may have stronger functional
      connectivity between memory functions within the CEN and social functioning in
      the SMG, and that their better sociality may result from using more memory for
      mentalizing during their daily social interactions.

TI  - The effect of combined hormonal contraceptives use on brain reactivity during
      response inhibition.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Objectives Cognitive control, which can be described as the ability to moderate
      impulses, has not previously been investigated in users of combined hormonal
      contraception (CHC). Given the suggested modulatory role of ovarian steroids in
      prefrontal dopaminergic function, which in turn taps into cognitive control, this
      randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled oral contraceptive trial set out
      to investigate the brain activity pattern during response inhibition in CHC
      users. Methods Thirty-four women were randomised to one treatment cycle with a
      levonorgestrel-containing CHC or placebo. The women performed a Go/NoGo task to
      measure brain activity during response inhibition by use of event-related
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) prior to and during the CHC/placebo 
      treatment cycle. Results No differences between CHC and placebo users in number
      of correct inhibitions were found during treatment, but only women on CHC
      significantly improved their performance between the baseline and treatment
      assessments. During the treatment cycle CHC users displayed decreased activity in
      the right middle frontal gyrus in comparison with placebo users. No other
      significant activations were evident between treatment groups or within groups.
      Conclusion Overall, CHC use had marginal effects on brain activity during
      response inhibition. If anything, the findings of the study may suggest reduced
      effort or increased efficiency in maintaining orbitofrontal cortex inhibitory
      cognitive control when using a combined oral contraceptive.

TI  - Brain Structural Integrity and Intrinsic Functional Connectivity Forecast 6 Year 
      Longitudinal Growth in Children's Numerical Abilities.
PG  - 11743-50
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0216-15.2015 [doi]
AB  - Early numerical proficiency lays the foundation for acquiring quantitative skills
      essential in today's technological society. Identification of cognitive and brain
      markers associated with long-term growth of children's basic numerical
      computation abilities is therefore of utmost importance. Previous attempts to
      relate brain structure and function to numerical competency have focused on
      behavioral measures from a single time point. Thus, little is known about the
      brain predictors of individual differences in growth trajectories of numerical
      abilities. Using a longitudinal design, with multimodal imaging and
      machine-learning algorithms, we investigated whether brain structure and
      intrinsic connectivity in early childhood are predictive of 6 year outcomes in
      numerical abilities spanning childhood and adolescence. Gray matter volume at age
      8 in distributed brain regions, including the ventrotemporal occipital cortex
      (VTOC), the posterior parietal cortex, and the prefrontal cortex, predicted
      longitudinal gains in numerical, but not reading, abilities. Remarkably,
      intrinsic connectivity analysis revealed that the strength of functional coupling
      among these regions also predicted gains in numerical abilities, providing novel 
      evidence for a network of brain regions that works in concert to promote
      numerical skill acquisition. VTOC connectivity with posterior parietal, anterior 
      temporal, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices emerged as the most extensive
      network predicting individual gains in numerical abilities. Crucially, behavioral
      measures of mathematics, IQ, working memory, and reading did not predict
      children's gains in numerical abilities. Our study identifies, for the first
      time, functional circuits in the human brain that scaffold the development of
      numerical skills, and highlights potential biomarkers for identifying children at
      risk for learning difficulties. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Children show substantial
      individual differences in math abilities and ease of math learning. Early
      numerical abilities provide the foundation for future academic and professional
      success in an increasingly technological society. Understanding the early
      identification of poor math skills has therefore taken on great significance.
      This work provides important new insights into brain structure and connectivity
      measures that can predict longitudinal growth of children's math skills over a 6 
      year period, and may eventually aid in the early identification of children who
      might benefit from targeted interventions.

TI  - Cortical and subcortical glutathione levels in adults with autism spectrum
      disorder.
LID - 10.1002/aur.1522 [doi]
AB  - Increased oxidative stress has been postulated to contribute to the pathogenesis 
      of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, reports of alterations in oxidation
      markers including glutathione (GSH), the major endogenous antioxidant, are
      indirect, coming from blood plasma level measurements and postmortem studies.
      Therefore we used in-vivo 3 Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      ([1H]MRS) to directly measure GSH concentrations in the basal ganglia (BG) and
      the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of 21 normally intelligent adult males with ASD
      and 29 controls who did not differ in age or IQ. There was no difference in brain
      GSH between patients and controls in either brain area; neither did GSH levels
      correlate with measures of clinical severity in patients. Thus [1H]MRS measures
      of cortical and subcortical GSH are not a biomarker for ASD in intellectually
      able adult men. Autism Res 2015. (c) 2015 The Authors Autism Research published

AB  - The aim of the current study was to determine genotype effects of four single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of the N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor
      (GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2C) and kainate receptor (GRIK1), which have been previously 
      associated with alcoholism, on behavior, neural cue-reactivity and drinking
      outcome. Eighty-six abstinent alcohol dependent patients were recruited from an
      in-patient setting. Neuropsychological tests, genotyping and functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) were used to study genotype effects. GRIN2C risk allele 
      carriers displayed increased alcohol cue-induced activation in the anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Neural
      activation in the ACC positively correlated with craving for alcohol (r = 0.201, 
      P = 0.032), whereas activation in the dlPFC showed a negative association (r =
      -0.215, P = 0.023). In addition, dlPFC activation predicted time to first relapse
      (HR = 2.701, 95%CI 1.244-5.864, P = 0.012). GRIK1 risk allele carriers showed
      increased cue-induced activation in the medial prefrontal (PFC) and orbitofrontal
      cortex (OFC) and in the lateral PFC and OFC. Activation in both clusters
      positively correlated with alcohol craving (rmedOFC, medPFC = 0.403, P = 0.001,
      rlatOFC, latPFC = 0.282, P = 0.008), and activation in the cluster that
      encompassed the medial OFC predicted time to first relapse (HR = 1.911, 95%CI
      1.030-3.545, P = 0.040). Findings indicate that SNPs in the GRIN2C and GRIK1
      genes are associated with altered cue-induced brain activation that is related to
      craving for alcohol and relapse risk.

TI  - Frontolimbic neural circuit changes in emotional processing and inhibitory
      control associated with clinical improvement following transference-focused
      psychotherapy in borderline personality disorder.
LID - 10.1111/pcn.12357 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by self-regulation
      deficits, including impulsivity and affective lability. Transference-focused
      psychotherapy (TFP) is an evidence-based treatment proven to reduce symptoms
      across multiple cognitive-emotional domains in BPD. This pilot study aimed to
      investigate neural activation associated with, and predictive of, clinical
      improvement in emotional and behavioral regulation in BPD following TFP. METHODS:
      BPD subjects (n = 10) were scanned pre- and post-TFP treatment using a
      within-subjects design. A disorder-specific emotional-linguistic go/no-go
      functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm was used to probe the interaction 
      between negative emotional processing and inhibitory control. RESULTS: Analyses
      demonstrated significant treatment-related effects with relative increased dorsal
      prefrontal (dorsal anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal, and frontopolar
      cortices) activation, and relative decreased ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and 
      hippocampal activation following treatment. Clinical improvement in constraint
      correlated positively with relative increased left dorsal anterior cingulate
      cortex activation. Clinical improvement in affective lability correlated
      positively with left posterior-medial orbitofrontal cortex/ventral striatum
      activation, and negatively with right amygdala/parahippocampal activation.
      Post-treatment improvements in constraint were predicted by pre-treatment right
      dorsal anterior cingulate cortex hypoactivation, and pre-treatment left
      posterior-medial orbitofrontal cortex/ventral striatum hypoactivation predicted
      improvements in affective lability. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings
      demonstrate potential TFP-associated alterations in frontolimbic circuitry and
      begin to identify neural mechanisms associated with a psychodynamically oriented 
      psychotherapy.

TI  - Impaired reward processing in the human prefrontal cortex distinguishes between
      persistent and remittent attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

LID - 10.1002/hbm.22944 [doi]
AB  - Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children often
      persist into adulthood and can lead to severe antisocial behavior. However,
      to-date it remains unclear whether neuro-functional abnormalities cause ADHD,
      which in turn can then provide a marker of persistent ADHD. Using event-related
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we measured blood oxygenation level
      dependent (BOLD) signal changes in subjects during a reversal learning task in
      which choice of the correct stimulus led to a probabilistically determined
      'monetary' reward or punishment. Participants were diagnosed with ADHD during
      their childhood (N = 32) and were paired with age, gender, and education matched 
      healthy controls (N = 32). Reassessment of the ADHD group as adults resulted in a
      split between either persistent (persisters, N = 17) or remitted ADHDs
      (remitters, N = 15). All three groups showed significantly decreased activation
      in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the left striatum during punished
      correct responses, however only remitters and controls presented significant
      psycho-physiological interaction between these fronto-striatal reward and outcome
      valence networks. Comparing persisters to remitters and controls showed
      significantly inverted responses to punishment (P < 0.05, family-wise error
      corrected) in left PFC region. Interestingly, the decreased activation shown
      after punishment was located in different areas of the PFC for remitters compared
      with controls, suggesting that remitters might have learned compensation
      strategies to overcome their ADHD symptoms. Thus, fMRI helps understanding the
      neuro-functional basis of ADHD related behavior differences and differentiates
      between persistent and remittent ADHD. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4648-4663, 2015. (c)

      in healthy adults: A preliminary multimodal rsfMRI-fMRI-MRS-dMRI study.
PG  - 4622-37
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22941 [doi]
AB  - Research in humans and animals has shown that negative childhood experiences
      (NCE) can have long-term effects on the structure and function of the brain.
      Alterations have been noted in grey and white matter, in the brain's resting
      state, on the glutamatergic system, and on neural and behavioural responses to
      aversive stimuli. These effects can be linked to psychiatric disorder such as
      depression and anxiety disorders that are influenced by excessive exposure to
      early life stressors. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect 
      of NCEs on these systems. Resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI), aversion task
      fMRI, glutamate magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and diffusion magnetic
      resonance imaging (dMRI) were combined with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire
      (CTQ) in healthy subjects to examine the impact of NCEs on the brain. Low CTQ
      scores, a measure of NCEs, were related to higher resting state glutamate levels 
      and higher resting state entropy in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). CTQ
      scores, mPFC glutamate and entropy, correlated with neural BOLD responses to the 
      anticipation of aversive stimuli in regions throughout the aversion-related
      network, with strong correlations between all measures in the motor cortex and
      left insula. Structural connectivity strength, measured using mean fractional
      anisotropy, between the mPFC and left insula correlated to aversion-related
      signal changes in the motor cortex. These findings highlight the impact of NCEs
      on multiple inter-related brain systems. In particular, they highlight the role
      of a prefrontal-insular-motor cortical network in the processing and responsivity
      to aversive stimuli and its potential adaptability by NCEs. Hum Brain Mapp

      behavior, one standout question remains unanswered: Why does imagery vary so much
      from one individual to the next? Here, we used a behavioral paradigm that
      measures the functional impact of a mental image on subsequent conscious
      perception and related these measures to the anatomy of the early visual cortex
      estimated by fMRI retinotopic mapping. We observed a negative relationship
      between primary visual cortex (V1) surface area and sensory imagery strength, but
      found positive relationships between V1 and imagery precision (spatial location
      and orientation). Hence, individuals with a smaller V1 tended to have stronger,
      but less precise imagery. In addition, subjective vividness of imagery was
      positively related to prefrontal cortex volume, but unrelated to V1 anatomy. Our 
      findings present the first evidence for the importance of the V1 layout in
      shaping the strength of human imagination.

AB  - Characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying the heritability of complex
      behavioral traits such as human anxiety remains a challenging endeavor for
      behavioral neuroscience. Copy-number variation (CNV) in the general transcription
      factor gene, GTF2I, located in the 7q11.23 chromosomal region that is hemideleted
      in Williams syndrome and duplicated in the 7q11.23 duplication syndrome (Dup7),
      is associated with gene-dose-dependent anxiety in mouse models and in both
      Williams syndrome and Dup7. Because of this recent preclinical and clinical
      identification of a genetic influence on anxiety, we examined whether sequence
      variation in GTF2I, specifically the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2527367,
      interacts with trait and state anxiety to collectively impact neural response to 
      anxiety-laden social stimuli. Two hundred and sixty healthy adults completed the 
      Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire Harm Avoidance (HA) subscale, a trait
      measure of anxiety proneness, and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) while matching aversive (fearful or angry) facial identity. We found an
      interaction between GTF2I allelic variations and HA that affects brain response: 
      in individuals homozygous for the major allele, there was no correlation between 
      HA and whole-brain response to aversive cues, whereas in heterozygotes and
      individuals homozygous for the minor allele, there was a positive correlation
      between HA sub-scores and a selective dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
      responsivity during the processing of aversive stimuli. These results demonstrate
      that sequence variation in the GTF2I gene influences the relationship between
      trait anxiety and brain response to aversive social cues in healthy individuals, 
      supporting a role for this neurogenetic mechanism in anxiety.

TI  - Brain system for mental orientation in space, time, and person.
PG  - 11072-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1504242112 [doi]
AB  - Orientation is a fundamental mental function that processes the relations between
      the behaving self to space (places), time (events), and person (people).
      Behavioral and neuroimaging studies have hinted at interrelations between
      processing of these three domains. To unravel the neurocognitive basis of
      orientation, we used high-resolution 7T functional MRI as 16 subjects compared
      their subjective distance to different places, events, or people. Analysis at the
      individual-subject level revealed cortical activation related to orientation in
      space, time, and person in a precisely localized set of structures in the
      precuneus, inferior parietal, and medial frontal cortex. Comparison of
      orientation domains revealed a consistent order of cortical activity inside the
      precuneus and inferior parietal lobes, with space orientation activating
      posterior regions, followed anteriorly by person and then time. Core regions at
      the precuneus and inferior parietal lobe were activated for multiple orientation 
      domains, suggesting also common processing for orientation across domains. The
      medial prefrontal cortex showed a posterior activation for time and anterior for 
      person. Finally, the default-mode network, identified in a separate resting-state
      scan, was active for all orientation domains and overlapped mostly with
      person-orientation regions. These findings suggest that mental orientation in
      space, time, and person is managed by a specific brain system with a highly
      ordered internal organization, closely related to the default-mode network.

AB  - The dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) is a key region for motor learning and
      sensorimotor integration, yet we have limited understanding of its functional
      interactions with other regions. Previous work has started to examine functional 
      connectivity in several brain areas using resting state functional connectivity
      (RSFC) and meta-analytical connectivity modelling (MACM). More recently,
      structural covariance (SC) has been proposed as a technique that may also allow
      delineation of functional connectivity. Here, we applied these three approaches
      to provide a comprehensive characterization of functional connectivity with a
      seed in the left dPMC that a previous meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging
      studies has identified as playing a key role in motor learning. Using data from
      two sources (the Rockland sample, containing resting state data and anatomical
      scans from 132 participants, and the BrainMap database, which contains peak
      activation foci from over 10,000 experiments), we conducted independent
      whole-brain functional connectivity mapping analyses of a dPMC seed. RSFC and
      MACM revealed similar connectivity maps spanning prefrontal, premotor, and
      parietal regions, while the SC map identified more widespread frontal regions.
      Analyses indicated a relatively consistent pattern of functional connectivity
      between RSFC and MACM that was distinct from that identified by SC. Notably,
      results indicate that the seed is functionally connected to areas involved in
      visuomotor control and executive functions, suggesting that the dPMC acts as an
      interface between motor control and cognition.

TI  - The imagined itch: brain circuitry supporting nocebo-induced itch in atopic
      dermatitis patients.
PG  - 1485-92
LID - 10.1111/all.12727 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychological factors are known to significantly modulate itch in
      patients suffering from chronic itch. Itch is also highly susceptible to both
      placebo and nocebo (negative placebo) effects. Brain activity likely supports
      nocebo-induced itch, but is currently unknown. METHODS: We collected functional
      MRI (fMRI) data from atopic dermatitis (AD) patients, in a within-subject design,
      and contrast brain response to nocebo saline understood to be allergen vs
      open-label saline control. Exploratory analyses compared results to real allergen
      itch response and placebo responsiveness, evaluated in the same patients.
      RESULTS: Nocebo saline produced greater itch than open saline control (P < 0.01).
      Compared to open saline, nocebo saline demonstrated greater fMRI response in
      caudate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and intraparietal sulcus (iPS) -
      brain regions important for cognitive executive and motivational processing.
      Exploratory analyses found that subjects with greater dlPFC and caudate
      activation to nocebo-induced itch also demonstrated greater dlPFC and caudate
      activation, respectively, for real allergen itch. Subjects reporting greater
      nocebo-induced itch also demonstrated greater placebo reduction of
      allergen-evoked itch, suggesting increased generalized modulation of itch
      perception. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the capacity of nocebo saline to 
      mimic both the sensory and neural effects of real allergens and provides an
      insight to the brain mechanisms supporting nocebo-induced itch in AD, thus aiding
      our understanding of the role that expectations and other psychological factors
      play in modulating itch perception in chronic itch patients.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormal brain functional
      connectivity may be the neural underpinning of addiction to illicit drugs and of 
      relapse after successful cessation therapy. Aberrant brain networks have been
      demonstrated in addicted patients and in newly abstinent addicts. However, it is 
      not known whether abnormal brain connectivity patterns persist after prolonged
      abstinence. In this cross-sectional study, whole-brain resting-state functional
      magnetic resonance images (8 min) were collected from 30 heroin-addicted
      individuals after a long period of abstinence (more than 3 years) and from 30
      healthy controls. We first examined the group differences in the resting-state
      functional connectivity of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region implicated
      in relapse-related processes, including craving and reactivity to stress
      following acute and protracted withdrawal from heroin. We then examined the
      relation between the duration of abstinence and the altered NAc functional
      connectivity in the heroin group. We found that, compared with controls,
      heroin-dependent participants exhibited significantly greater functional
      connectivity between the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the NAc and
      weaker functional connectivity between the NAc and the left putamen, left
      precuneus, and supplementary motor area. However, with longer abstinence time,
      the strength of NAc functional connectivity with the left putamen increased.
      These results indicate that dysfunction of the NAc functional network is still
      present in long-term-abstinent heroin-dependent individuals. (c) 2015 Wiley

AB  - Neuroimaging and behavioral evidence has suggested that the lateral prefrontal
      cortex is involved in individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC).
      However, few studies have localized the neural structures that differentiate high
      and low WMC individuals, considering the functional architecture of the
      prefrontal cortex. The present study aimed to identify a frontal region that
      underlies individual differences from the perspective of the hierarchical
      architecture of the frontal cortex. By manipulating an episodic factor of
      cognitive control (control in selecting an appropriate task set according to a
      temporal context) and using a parametric modulation analysis, we found that both 
      high- and low- WMC individuals have similar activation patterns in the premotor
      cortex (BA6, 8), caudal prefrontal cortex (BA44, 45), and frontopolar cortex
      (BA10, 11), but differed in the rostral part of the prefrontal cortex (BA46/47); 
      high WMC individuals showed greater activation in the higher episodic control
      condition, whereas low WMC individuals showed reduced activation when episodic
      control was required. Similar patterns of activation were found in the right
      inferior parietal and middle/inferior temporal cortices. These results indicate
      that the rostral prefrontal cortex, which supports episodic cognitive control,
      possibly by sending a weighting signal toward the inferior parietal and
      middle/inferior temporal cortices that modulate saliency and sensory processing, 
      underlies individual differences in WMC. Episodic control account, which
      considers the organization of the prefrontal cortex, fits well with previous
      findings of individual differences in WMC.

AB  - The literature on action observation revealed contradictory results regarding the
      activation of different subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex when observing
      unusual behaviour. Error observation research has shown that the posterior part
      of the medial prefrontal cortex is more active when observing unusual behaviour
      compared to usual behaviour while action understanding research has revealed some
      mixed results concerning the role of the anterior part of the medial prefrontal
      cortex during the observation of unusual actions. Here, we resolve this
      discrepancy in the literature by showing that different parts of the medial
      prefrontal cortex are active depending on whether an observed unusual behaviour
      is intentional or not. While the posterior medial prefrontal cortex is more
      active when we observe unusual accidental actions compared to unusual intentional
      actions, a more anterior part of the medial prefrontal cortex is more active when
      we observe unusual intentional actions compared to unusual accidental actions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with brain function 
      and morphological alterations. This study investigated explicit verbal memory
      impairment in patients with GAD in terms of brain functional deficits in
      combination with morphologic changes. METHODS: Seventeen patients with GAD and 17
      healthy controls matched for age, sex, and education level underwent
      high-resolution T1-weighted MRI and fMR imaging at 3 T during explicit verbal
      memory tasks with emotionally neutral and anxiety-inducing words. RESULTS: In
      response to the neutral words, the patients showed significantly lower activities
      in the regions of the hippocampus (Hip), middle cingulate gyrus (MCG), putamen
      (Pu) and head of the caudate nucleus (HCd) compared with healthy controls. In
      response to the anxiety-inducing words, the patients showed significantly higher 
      activities in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and precentral gyrus. However, 
      they showed lower activities in the Hip, MCG, Pu and HCd. In addition, patients
      with GAD showed a significant reduction in gray matter volumes, especially in the
      regions of the Hip, midbrain, thalamus, insula and superior temporal gyrus,
      compared with healthy controls. LIMITATIONS: This study examined a small sample
      sizes in each of the groups, and there was no consideration of a medication
      effect on brain activity and volume changes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides
      evidence for the association between brain functional deficits and morphometric
      alterations in an explicit verbal memory task for patients with GAD. This finding
      is helpful for understanding explicit verbal memory impairment in connection with
      GAD symptoms.

      brain injury.
LID - nsv105 [pii]
AB  - The ability to survive within a cooperative society depends on impartial
      third-party punishment (TPP) of social norm violations. Two cognitive mechanisms 
      have been postulated as necessary for the successful completion of TPP:
      evaluation of legal responsibility and selection of a suitable punishment given
      the magnitude of the crime. Converging neuroimaging research suggests two
      supporting domain-general networks; a mentalizing network for evaluation of legal
      responsibility and a central-executive network for determination of punishment. A
      whole-brain voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach was used in conjunction
      with a rank-order TPP task to identify brain regions necessary for TPP in a large
      sample of patients with penetrating traumatic brain injury. Patients who
      demonstrated atypical TPP had specific lesions in core regions of the mentalizing
      (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex [PFC], ventromedial PFC) and central-executive
      (bilateral dorsolateral PFC, right intraparietal sulcus) networks. Altruism and
      executive functioning (concept formation skills) were significant predictors of
      TPP: altruism was uniquely associated with TPP in patients with lesions in right 
      dorsolateral PFC and executive functioning was uniquely associated with TPP in
      individuals with lesions in left PFC. Our findings contribute to the extant
      literature to support underlying neural networks associated with TPP, with
      specific brain-behavior causal relationships confirming recent functional
      neuroimaging research.

AB  - Cortisol awakening response (CAR) is the cortisol secretory activity in the first
      30-60min immediately after awakening in the morning. Alterations in CAR as a
      trait have been associated with changes in the brain structure and function. CAR 
      also fluctuates over days. Little, however, is known about the relationship
      between CAR as a state and brain activity. Using resting-state functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated whether the CAR predicts
      intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) of the brain in the afternoon of the same 
      day. Data from forty-nine healthy participants were analyzed. Salivary cortisol
      levels were assessed immediately after awakening and 15, 30 and 60min after
      awakening, and resting-state fMRI data were obtained in the afternoon. Global FC 
      strength (FCS) of each voxel was computed to provide a whole-brain
      characterization of intrinsic functional architecture. Correlation analysis was
      used to examine whether CAR predicts the intrinsic FC of core brain networks. We 
      observed that the CAR was positively correlated with the FCS of the medial
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Further analysis revealed that higher CAR predicted
      stronger positive mPFC connectivity with regions in the default mode network. Our
      findings suggest that the HPA activity after awakening in the early morning may
      predict intrinsic functional connectivity of mPFC at rest in the afternoon of the
      same day.

AB  - Intergroup bias-the tendency to behave more positively toward an ingroup member
      than an outgroup member-is a powerful social force, for good and ill. Although it
      is widely demonstrated, intergroup bias is not universal, as it is characterized 
      by significant individual differences. Recently, attention has begun to turn to
      whether neuroanatomy might explain these individual differences in intergroup
      bias. However, no research to date has examined whether white matter
      microstructure could help determine differences in behavior toward ingroup and
      outgroup members. In the current research, we examine intergroup bias with the
      third-party punishment paradigm and white matter integrity and connectivity
      strength as determined by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We found that both
      increased white matter integrity at the right temporal-parietal junction (TPJ)
      and connectivity strength between the right TPJ and the dorsomedial prefrontal
      cortex (DMPFC) were associated with increased impartiality in the third-party
      punishment paradigm, i.e., reduced intergroup bias. Further, consistent with the 
      role that these brain regions play in the mentalizing network, we found that
      these effects were mediated by mentalizing processes. Participants with greater
      white matter integrity at the right TPJ and connectivity strength between the
      right TPJ and the DMPFC employed mentalizing processes more equally for ingroup
      and outgroup members, and this non-biased use of mentalizing was associated with 
      increased impartiality. The current results help shed light on the mechanisms of 
      bias and, potentially, on interventions that promote impartiality over intergroup
      bias.

AB  - The well-articulated Self Attention Network (SAN) framework accounts for a great 
      portion of the available evidence on neurocognitive interactions between
      self-bias phenomena and attention. I argue that more work is necessary to refine 
      our understanding about the effective and functional connectivity of the
      different nodes of the proposed network. In particular, the nature of the control
      of ventro-medial prefrontal cortex over posterior superior temporal sulcus has to
      be worked out further. Simple excitatory connections between these two nodes, as 
      proposed by the SAN model, do not satisfactorily account for existing
      neuropsychological dissociations and are not fully warranted by neuroimaging
      evidence.

AB  - The key idea of statistical hypothesis testing is to fix, and thereby control,
      the Type I error (false positive) rate across samples of any size. Multiple
      comparisons inflate the global (family-wise) Type I error rate and the
      traditional solution to maintaining control of the error rate is to increase the 
      local (comparison-wise) Type II error (false negative) rates. However, in the
      analysis of human brain imaging data, the number of comparisons is so large that 
      this solution breaks down: the local Type II error rate ends up being so large
      that scientifically meaningful analysis is precluded. Here we propose a novel
      solution to this problem: allow the Type I error rate to converge to zero along
      with the Type II error rate. It works because when the Type I error rate per
      comparison is very small, the accumulation (or global) Type I error rate is also 
      small. This solution is achieved by employing the likelihood paradigm, which uses
      likelihood ratios to measure the strength of evidence on a voxel-by-voxel basis. 
      In this paper, we provide theoretical and empirical justification for a
      likelihood approach to the analysis of human brain imaging data. In addition, we 
      present extensive simulations that show the likelihood approach is viable,
      leading to "cleaner"-looking brain maps and operational superiority (lower
      average error rate). Finally, we include a case study on cognitive control
      related activation in the prefrontal cortex of the human brain.

TI  - Greater preference consistency during the Willingness-to-Pay task is related to
      higher resting state connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and 
      the ventral striatum.
AB  - The significance of why a similar set of brain regions are associated with the
      default mode network and value-related neural processes remains to be clarified. 
      Here, we examined i) whether brain regions exhibiting willingness-to-pay (WTP)
      task-related activity are intrinsically connected when the brain is at rest, ii) 
      whether these regions overlap spatially with the default mode network, and iii)
      whether individual differences in choice behavior during the WTP task are
      reflected in functional brain connectivity at rest. Blood-oxygen-level dependent 
      (BOLD) signal was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging while
      subjects performed the WTP task and at rest with eyes open. Brain regions that
      tracked the value of bids during the WTP task were used as seed regions in an
      analysis of functional connectivity in the resting state data. The seed in the
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex was functionally connected to core regions of the 
      WTP task-related network. Brain regions within the WTP task-related network,
      namely the ventral precuneus, ventromedial prefrontal and posterior cingulate
      cortex overlapped spatially with publically available maps of the default mode
      network. Also, those individuals with higher functional connectivity during rest 
      between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum showed
      greater preference consistency during the WTP task. Thus, WTP task-related
      regions are an intrinsic network of the brain that corresponds spatially with the
      default mode network, and individual differences in functional connectivity
      within the WTP network at rest may reveal a priori biases in choice behavior.

TI  - Cerebral Inefficient Activation in Schizophrenia Patients and Their Unaffected
      Parents during the N-Back Working Memory Task: A Family fMRI Study.
PG  - e0135468
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0135468 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that working memory deficits is a core feature 
      of symptomatology of schizophrenia, which can be detected in patients and their
      unaffected relatives. The impairment of working memory has been found related to 
      the abnormal activity of human brain regions in many functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. This study investigated how brain region
      activation was altered in schizophrenia and how it was inherited independently
      from performance deficits. METHOD: The authors used fMRI method during N-back
      task to assess working memory related cortical activation in four groups (N = 20 
      in each group, matching task performance, age, gender and education):
      schizophrenic patients, their unaffected biological parents, young healthy
      controls for the patients and older healthy controls for their parents. RESULTS: 
      Compared to healthy controls, patients showed an exaggerated response in the
      right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (brodmann area [BA] 46) and bilateral
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and had reduced activation in bilateral
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9). In the conjunction analysis, the effect of
      genetic risk (parents versus older control) shared significantly overlapped
      activation with effect of disease (patients versus young control) in the right
      middle frontal gyrus (BA 46) and left inferior parietal gyrus (BA 40).
      CONCLUSIONS: Physiological inefficiency of dorsal prefrontal cortex and
      compensation involvement of ventral prefrontal cortex in working memory function 
      may one physiological characteristics of schizophrenia. And relatively
      inefficient activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex probably can be a
      promising intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia.

TI  - Longitudinal Changes in Prefrontal Cortex Activation Underlie Declines in
      Adolescent Risk Taking.
PG  - 11308-14
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1553-15.2015 [doi]
AB  - Adolescence is a critical developmental phase during which risk-taking behaviors 
      increase across a variety of species, raising the importance of understanding how
      brain changes contribute to such behaviors. While the prefrontal cortex is
      thought to influence adolescent risk taking, the specific ways in which it
      functions are unclear. Using longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
      in human adolescents, we found that ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC)
      activation decreased during an experimental risk-taking task over time, with
      greater declines in VLPFC associated with greater declines in self-reported risky
      behavior. Furthermore, greater decreases in functional coupling between the
      medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and ventral striatum over time were associated
      with decreases in self-reported risky behavior. Thus, disparate roles of the
      VLPFC and MPFC modulate longitudinal declines in adolescent risk taking.
      SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Adolescence is a developmental period marked by steep
      increases in risk-taking behavior coupled with dramatic brain changes. Although
      theories propose that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may influence adolescent risk
      taking, the specific ways in which it functions remain unclear. We report the
      first longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging study to examine how
      neural activation during risk taking changes over time and contributes to
      adolescents' real-life risk-taking behavior. We find that longitudinal declines
      in activation of the ventrolateral PFC are linked to declines in adolescent risk 
      taking, whereas the medial PFC influences adolescent risk taking via its
      functional neural coupling with reward-related regions. This is the first study
      to identify the mechanism by which different regions of the PFC disparately
      contribute to declines in risk taking.

PG  - 11209-20

AB  - In decision making, dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex show a
      sensitivity to key decision variables, such as reward prediction errors. It is
      unclear whether these signals reflect parallel processing of a common synchronous
      input to both regions, for example from mesocortical dopamine, or separate and
      consecutive stages in reward processing. These two perspectives make distinct
      predictions about the relative timing of feedback-related activity in each of
      these regions, a question we address here. To reconstruct the unique temporal
      contribution of dorsomedial (dmPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) to
      simultaneously measured EEG activity in human subjects, we developed a novel
      trialwise fMRI-informed EEG analysis that allows dissociating correlated and
      overlapping sources. We show that vmPFC uniquely contributes a sustained
      activation profile shortly after outcome presentation, whereas dmPFC contributes 
      a later and more peaked activation pattern. This temporal dissociation is
      expressed mainly in the alpha band for a vmPFC signal, which contrasts with a
      theta based dmPFC signal. Thus, our data show reward-related vmPFC and dmPFC
      responses have distinct time courses and unique spectral profiles, findings that 
      support distinct functional roles in a reward-processing network. SIGNIFICANCE
      STATEMENT: Multiple subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex are known to be
      involved in decision making and learning, and expose similar response patterns in
      fMRI. Here, we used a novel approach to analyzing simultaneous EEG-fMRI that
      allows to dissociate the individual time courses of brain regions. We find that
      vmPFC and dmPFC have distinguishable time courses and time-frequency patterns.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The superior temporal gyrus (STG) is one of the key regions
      implicated in psychosis, given that abnormalities in this region are associated
      with an increased risk of conversion from an at-risk mental state to psychosis.
      However, inconsistent results regarding the functional connectivity strength of
      the STG have been reported, and the regional heterogeneous characteristics of the
      STG should be considered. METHODS: To investigate the distinctive functional
      connection of each subregion in the STG, we parcellated the STG of each
      hemisphere into three regions: the planum temporale, Heschl's gyrus, and planum
      polare. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was obtained from 22 
      first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients, 41 individuals at ultra-high-risk for
      psychosis (UHR), and 47 demographically matched healthy controls. RESULTS:
      Significant group differences (in seed-based connectivity) were demonstrated in
      the left planum temporale and from both the right and left Heschl's gyrus seeds. 
      From the left planum temporale seed, the FEP and UHR groups exhibited increased
      connectivity to the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, the
      FEP and UHR groups demonstrated decreased connectivity from the bilateral
      Heschl's gyrus seeds to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. The enhanced
      connectivity between the left planum temporale and right dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex was positively correlated with positive symptom severity in individuals at
      UHR (r = .34, p = .03). CONCLUSIONS: These findings corroborate the
      fronto-temporal connectivity disruption hypothesis in schizophrenia by providing 
      evidence supporting the altered fronto-temporal intrinsic functional connection
      at earlier stages of psychosis. Our data indicate that subregion-specific
      aberrant fronto-temporal interactions exist in the STG at the early stage of
      psychosis, thus suggesting that these aberrancies are the neural underpinning of 
      proneness to psychosis.

TI  - Individual classification of ADHD children by right prefrontal hemodynamic
      responses during a go/no-go task as assessed by fNIRS.
PG  - 1-12

AB  - While a growing body of neurocognitive research has explored the neural
      substrates associated with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), an
      objective biomarker for diagnosis has not been established. The advent of
      functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which is a noninvasive and
      unrestrictive method of functional neuroimaging, raised the possibility of
      introducing functional neuroimaging diagnosis in young ADHD children. Previously,
      our fNIRS-based measurements successfully visualized the hypoactivation pattern
      in the right prefrontal cortex during a go/no-go task in ADHD children compared
      with typically developing control children at a group level. The current study
      aimed to explore a method of individual differentiation between ADHD and
      typically developing control children using multichannel fNIRS, emphasizing how
      spatial distribution and amplitude of hemodynamic response are associated with
      inhibition-related right prefrontal dysfunction. Thirty ADHD and thirty typically
      developing control children underwent a go/no-go task, and their cortical
      hemodynamics were assessed using fNIRS. We explored specific regions of interest 
      (ROIs) and cut-off amplitudes for cortical activation to distinguish ADHD
      children from control children. The ROI located on the border of inferior and
      middle frontal gyri yielded the most accurate discrimination. Furthermore, we
      adapted well-formed formulae for the constituent channels of the optimized ROI,
      leading to improved classification accuracy with an area under the curve value of
      85% and with 90% sensitivity. Thus, the right prefrontal hypoactivation assessed 
      by fNIRS would serve as a potentially effective biomarker for classifying ADHD
      children at the individual level.

TI  - The effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in obese females with
      binge eating disorder: a protocol for a double-blinded, randomized,
      sham-controlled trial.
PG  - 194

AB  - BACKGROUND: Binge eating disorder is a new category in DSM-5 and highly
      associated with higher body mass index. The neural mechanisms that underlie binge
      eating are of great interest in order to improve treatment interventions. Brain
      mechanisms underlying drug and food craving are suggested to be similar: for
      example, both are reported to be associated with increased neural activity in the
      orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, and a diminished regulatory
      influence from lateral prefrontal circuits. Several studies have begun to assess 
      the potential benefits of brain stimulation in reducing craving and addictive
      behaviors. Data from a study of a one-off session of transcranial magnetic
      stimulation in healthy women identified as strong cravers and of individuals with
      bulimic-type eating disorders, reported a reduction in food craving and binge
      eating episodes. This provides support for a more extensive investigation of the 
      potential therapeutic benefits of transcranial magnetic stimulation. Lastly,
      brain imaging studies and a dimensional approach, will improve understanding of
      the neural correlates of the disorders and of the mode of action of transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation. METHODS/DESIGN: Sixty eligible obese females, with binge
      eating disorder, will be randomly allocated to receive 20 sessions of
      transcranial magnetic stimulation intervention (n = 30) or the sham transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation intervention (n = 30) scattered 3 days/week. Thirty eligible
      controls will complete the baseline assessment. The primary outcome (number of
      binge eating episodes) will be assed at each treatment sessions, and 8 weeks
      after intervention completion (follow-up). It is hypothesized that mean weekly
      binge-eating episodes will be reduced in the intervention group, compared to the 
      sham group, and that the effect will be maintained at follow-up. DISCUSSION:
      Despite the severity associated with Binge Eating Disorder, there are limited
      treatment options. This study is an important step in the development of more
      effective treatments. Importantly, the study is the first to investigating binge 
      eating disorder using a dimensional approach, by looking at the different aspects
      of the disorder, such as behavioral factors, biological factors, brain circuits
      and chemistry. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials NCT02180984 . Registered in

AB  - How do people value environmental resources? To estimate public valuation of
      natural resources, researchers often conduct surveys that ask people how much
      they would be willing to pay to preserve or restore threatened natural resources.
      However, these survey responses often elicit complex affective responses,
      including negative reactions toward proposed destructive land uses of those
      resources. To better characterize processes that underlie the valuation of
      environmental resources, we conducted behavioral and neuroimaging experiments in 
      which subjects chose whether or not to donate money to protect natural park lands
      (iconic versus non-iconic) from proposed land uses (destructive versus
      non-destructive). In both studies, land use destructiveness motivated subjects'
      donations more powerfully than did the iconic qualities of the parks themselves. 
      Consistent with an anticipatory affect account, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activity
      increased in response to more iconic parks, while anterior insula activity
      increased in response to more destructive uses, and the interaction of these
      considerations altered activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Further, 
      anterior insula activity predicted increased donations to preserve parks
      threatened by destructive uses, but MPFC activity predicted reduced donations.
      Finally, individuals with stronger pro-environmental attitudes showed greater
      anterior insula activity in response to proposed destructive uses. These results 
      imply that negative responses to destructive land uses may play a prominent role 
      in environmental valuation, potentially overshadowing positive responses to the
      environmental resources themselves. The findings also suggest that neuroimaging
      methods might eventually complement traditional survey methods by allowing
      researchers to disentangle distinct affective responses that influence
      environmental valuation.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies have revealed abnormal brain dynamics of male
      sexual arousal (SA) in psychogenic erectile dysfunction (pED). However, the
      neuroanatomical correlates of pED are still unclear. In this work, we obtained
      cortical thickness (CTh) measurements from structural magnetic resonance images
      of 40 pED patients and 39 healthy control subjects. Abnormalities in CTh related 
      to pED were explored using a scale space search based brain morphometric
      analysis. Organizations of brain structural covariance networks were analyzed as 
      well. Compared with healthy men, pED patients showed significantly decreased CTh 
      in widespread cortical regions, most of which were previously reported to show
      abnormal dynamics of male SA in pED, such as the medial prefrontal,
      orbitofrontal, cingulate, inferotemporal, and insular cortices. CTh reductions in
      these areas were found to be significantly correlated with male sexual
      functioning degradation. Moreover, pED patients showed decreased interregional
      CTh correlations from the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex to the right
      supramarginal gyrus and the left angular cortex, implying disassociations between
      the cognitive, motivational, and inhibitory networks of male SA in pED. This work
      provides structural insights on the complex phenomenon of psychogenic sexual
      dysfunction in men, and suggests a specific vulnerability factor, possibly as an 
      extra "organic" factor, that may play an important role in pED. Hum Brain Mapp

TI  - Changing brains: how longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging studies
      can inform us about cognitive and social-affective growth trajectories.
PG  - 53-63
LID - 10.1002/wcs.1327 [doi]
AB  - Brain imaging studies have demonstrated widespread changes in brain networks
      which support cognitive and social-affective development. These conclusions,
      however, are largely based on cross-sectional comparisons, which limits the
      possibility to investigate growth trajectories and detect individual changes.
      Understanding individual growth patterns is crucial if we want to ultimately
      understand how brain development is sensitive to environmental influences such as
      educational or psychological interventions or childhood maltreatment. Recently,
      longitudinal brain imaging studies in children and adolescents have taken the
      first steps into examining cognitive and social-affective brain functions
      longitudinally with several compelling findings. First, longitudinal measurements
      show that activations in some brain regions, such as the prefrontal, temporal,
      and parietal cortex, are relatively stable over time and can be used as
      predictors for cognitive functions, whereas activations in other brain regions,
      such as the amygdala and ventral striatum, are much more variable over time.
      Second, developmental studies reveal how these changes are related to age,
      puberty, and changes in performance. These findings have implications for
      understanding how environmental factors influence brain development. An important
      future direction will be to examine individual characteristics (e.g., genetic,
      temperamental, personality) which make individuals differentially susceptible to 
      their environment.

TI  - Atypical spatiotemporal signatures of working memory brain processes in autism.
PG  - e617
LID - 10.1038/tp.2015.107 [doi]
AB  - Working memory (WM) impairments may contribute to the profound behavioural
      manifestations in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, previous
      behavioural results are discrepant as are the few functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) results collected in adults and adolescents with ASD. Here we
      investigate the precise temporal dynamics of WM-related brain activity using
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 20 children with ASD and matched controls during 
      an n-back WM task across different load levels (1-back vs 2-back). Although
      behavioural results were similar between ASD and typically developing (TD)
      children, the between-group comparison performed on functional brain activity
      showed atypical WM-related brain processes in children with ASD compared with TD 
      children. These atypical responses were observed in the ASD group from 200 to 600
      ms post stimulus in both the low- (1-back) and high- (2-back) memory load
      conditions. During the 1-back condition, children with ASD showed reduced
      WM-related activations in the right hippocampus and the cingulate gyrus compared 
      with TD children who showed more activation in the left dorso-lateral prefrontal 
      cortex and the insulae. In the 2-back condition, children with ASD showed less
      activity in the left insula and midcingulate gyrus and more activity in the left 
      precuneus than TD children. In addition, reduced activity in the anterior
      cingulate cortex was correlated with symptom severity in children with ASD. Thus,
      this MEG study identified the precise timing and sources of atypical WM-related
      activity in frontal, temporal and parietal regions in children with ASD. The
      potential impacts of such atypicalities on social deficits of autism are
      discussed.

TI  - Magnetoencephalographic Correlates of Emotional Processing in Major Depression
      Before and After Pharmacological Treatment.
LID - pyv093 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyv093 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In major depressive disorder (MDD), electrophysiological and imaging 
      studies suggest reduced neural activity in the parietal and dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex regions. In the present study, neural correlates of emotional
      processing in MDD were analyzed for the first time in a pre-/post-treatment
      design by means of magnetoencephalography (MEG), allowing for detecting temporal 
      dynamics of brain activation. METHODS: Twenty-five medication-free Caucasian
      in-patients with MDD and 25 matched controls underwent a baseline MEG session
      with passive viewing of pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral pictures. Fifteen
      patients were followed-up with a second MEG session after 4 weeks of
      antidepressant monopharmacotherapy with mirtazapine. The corresponding controls
      received no intervention between the measurements. The clinical course of
      depression was assessed using the Hamilton Depression scale. RESULTS: Prior to
      treatment, an overall neocortical hypoactivation during emotional processing,
      particularly at the parietal regions and areas at the right temporoparietal
      junction, as well as abnormal valence-specific reactions at the right parietal
      and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) regions were observed in
      patients compared to controls. These effects occurred <150ms, suggesting
      dysfunctional processing of emotional stimuli at a preconscious level. Successful
      antidepressant treatment resulted in a normalization of the hypoactivation at the
      right parietal and right temporoparietal regions. Accordingly, both dlPFC regions
      revealed an increase of activity after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The present study
      provides neurophysiological evidence for dysfunctional emotional processing in a 
      fronto-parieto-temporal network, possibly contributing to the pathogenesis of
      MDD. These activation patterns might have the potential to serve as biomarkers of
      treatment success.

      visual word recognition.
PG  - 423
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00423 [doi]
AB  - Many neurocognitive studies investigated the neural correlates of visual word
      recognition, some of which manipulated the orthographic neighborhood density of
      words and nonwords believed to influence the activation of orthographically
      similar representations in a hypothetical mental lexicon. Previous neuroimaging
      research failed to find evidence for such global lexical activity associated with
      neighborhood density. Rather, effects were interpreted to reflect semantic or
      domain general processing. The present fMRI study revealed effects of lexicality,
      orthographic neighborhood density and a lexicality by orthographic neighborhood
      density interaction in a silent reading task. For the first time we found greater
      activity for words and nonwords with a high number of neighbors. We propose that 
      this activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex reflects activation of
      orthographically similar codes in verbal working memory thus providing evidence
      for global lexical activity as the basis of the neighborhood density effect. The 
      interaction of lexicality by neighborhood density in the ventromedial prefrontal 
      cortex showed lower activity in response to words with a high number compared to 
      nonwords with a high number of neighbors. In the light of these results the
      facilitatory effect for words and inhibitory effect for nonwords with many
      neighbors observed in previous studies can be understood as being due to the
      operation of a fast-guess mechanism for words and a temporal deadline mechanism
      for nonwords as predicted by models of visual word recognition. Furthermore, we
      propose that the lexicality effect with higher activity for words compared to
      nonwords in inferior parietal and middle temporal cortex reflects the operation
      of an identification mechanism based on local lexico-semantic activity.

TI  - Disrupted Topological Organization of Resting-State Functional Brain Network in
      Subcortical Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment.

AB  - AIMS: Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated both structural and functional
      abnormalities in widespread brain regions in patients with subcortical vascular
      mild cognitive impairment (svMCI). However, whether and how these changes alter
      functional brain network organization remains largely unknown. METHODS: We
      recruited 21 patients with svMCI and 26 healthy control (HC) subjects who
      underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Graph
      theory-based network analyses were used to investigate alterations in the
      topological organization of functional brain networks. RESULTS: Compared with the
      HC individuals, the patients with svMCI showed disrupted global network topology 
      with significantly increased path length and modularity. Modular structure was
      also impaired in the svMCI patients with a notable rearrangement of the executive
      control module, where the parietal regions were split out and grouped as a
      separate module. The svMCI patients also revealed deficits in the intra- and/or
      intermodule connectivity of several brain regions. Specifically, the
      within-module degree was decreased in the middle cingulate gyrus while it was
      increased in the left anterior insula, medial prefrontal cortex and cuneus.
      Additionally, increased intermodule connectivity was observed in the inferior and
      superior parietal gyrus, which was associated with worse cognitive performance in
      the svMCI patients. CONCLUSION: Together, our results indicate that svMCI
      patients exhibit dysregulation of the topological organization of functional
      brain networks, which has important implications for understanding the
      pathophysiological mechanism of svMCI.

TI  - Glutamatergic dysfunction linked to energy and membrane lipid metabolism in
      frontal and anterior cingulate cortices of never treated first-episode
      schizophrenia patients.
PG  - 322-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glutamatergic dysfunction and altered membrane lipid and energy
      metabolism have been repeatedly demonstrated in the frontal/prefrontal and
      anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in schizophrenia. Though having been already
      studied in animals, the presumed link between glutamatergic function and
      structural plasticity has not been investigated directly in the human brain yet. 
      We measured glutamate (Glu), focal energy metabolism, and membrane phospholipid
      turnover to investigate main pathologies in those key brain regions of
      schizophrenia. METHODS: (1)H- and (31)P-Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI) was combined
      in a single session to assess Glu and markers of energy (PCr, ATP) and membrane
      lipid (PME, PDE) metabolism in 31 neuroleptic-naive first acute onset psychosis
      patients and 31 matched healthy controls. Multivariate analyses of covariance
      were used to assess disease effects on Glu and to investigate the impact of Glu
      alterations on phospholipid and energy metabolites. RESULTS: Glu levels of
      patients were increased in the frontal and prefrontal cortex bilaterally and in
      the ACC. Higher Glu was associated with increased left frontal/prefrontal PME and
      right frontal/prefrontal PDE in patients, which was not observed in healthy
      controls. In contrast, higher Glu levels were associated with lower PCr or ATP
      values in the frontal/prefrontal cortex bilaterally and in the right ACC of
      controls. This was not observed in the right ACC and left frontal/prefrontal
      cortex of patients. CONCLUSION: Frontal glutamatergic hyperactivity is
      disconnected from physiologically regulated energy metabolism and is associated
      with increased membrane breakdown in right and increased membrane restoration in 
      left frontal and prefrontal cortical regions. As indicated by previous findings, 
      this pathology is likely dynamic during the course of first acute illness and
      possibly associated with negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. Our findings
      underline the importance of further research on neuroprotective treatment options
      during the early acute or even better for the ultra-high risk state of psychotic 
      illness.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the neural correlates of emotion processing in
      treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia (SCZ-TR). METHODS: Twenty-two
      SCZ-TR patients on clozapine, 24 schizophrenia patients on antipsychotics other
      than clozapine, and 39 healthy controls were scanned using functional
      neuroimaging while viewing positive, negative and neutral images. RESULTS:
      Emotionally-laden images (positive and negative) elicited hyper-activations in
      the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex and left cerebellum in SCZ-TR patients,
      compared to the two other groups. Similarly, neutral images prompted
      hyper-activations in the cingulate gyrus in SCZ-TR patients, relative to the two 
      other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment resistance is associated with
      neuro-functional hyper-activations in schizophrenia patients during emotion
      processing.

AB  - Brain imaging studies highlighted structural differences in congenital amusia, a 
      life-long perceptual disorder that is associated with pitch perception and pitch 
      memory deficits. A functional anomaly characterized by decreased low gamma
      oscillations (30-40Hz range) in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 
      during pitch memory has been revealed recently. Thus, the present study
      investigates whether applying transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)
      at 35Hz to the right DLPFC would improve pitch memory. Nine amusics took part in 
      two tACS sessions (either 35Hz or 90Hz) and completed a pitch and visual memory
      task before and during stimulation. 35Hz stimulation facilitated pitch memory
      significantly. No modulation effects were found with 90Hz stimulation or on the
      visual task. While amusics showed a selective impairment of pitch memory before
      stimulation, the performance during 35Hz stimulation was not significantly
      different to healthy controls anymore. Taken together, the study shows that
      modulating the right DLPFC with 35Hz tACS in congenital amusia selectively
      improves pitch memory performance supporting the hypothesis that decreased gamma 
      oscillations within the DLPFC are causally involved in disturbed pitch memory and
      highlight the potential use of tACS to interact with cognitive processes.

AB  - Evidence is heterogeneous regarding whether patients with borderline personality 
      disorder (BPD) display disturbed emotional inhibition in the emotional Stroop
      task. Previous findings suggest that state dissociation may influence cognitive
      inhibition of task-irrelevant material, particularly with negative content. Our
      aim was to examine performance in an emotional Stroop task including negative,
      neutral, and positive words in BPD patients and healthy controls during
      functional magnetic resonance imaging. In advance, half of the BPD patients
      underwent a dissociation induction using script-driven imagery. BPD patients
      without dissociation induction showed behavioural performance comparable to that 
      of healthy controls but displayed stronger neural responses, especially to
      positive stimuli, in the superior temporal gyrus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, 
      and anterior cingulate cortex. BPD patients with dissociation induction showed
      overall slower and less accurate responses as well as increased reaction times
      for negative versus neutral words compared with BPD patients without dissociation
      induction. Moreover, they showed comparatively decreased neuronal activity in the
      fusiform gyrus and parietal cortices independent of valence, but elevated
      activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus in response to negative versus
      neutral words. In conclusion, experimentally induced dissociation in BPD was
      associated with inefficient cognitive inhibition, particularly of negative
      stimuli, in the emotional Stroop task.

AB  - Influential theories of brain-viscera interactions propose a central role for
      interoception in basic motivational and affective feeling states. Recent
      neuroimaging studies have underlined the insula, anterior cingulate, and ventral 
      prefrontal cortices as the neural correlates of interoception. However, the
      relationships between these distributed brain regions remain unclear. In this
      study, we used spatial independent component analysis (ICA) and functional
      network connectivity (FNC) approaches to investigate time course correlations
      across the brain regions during visceral interoception. Functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed in thirteen healthy females who underwent 
      viscerosensory stimulation of bladder as a representative internal organ at
      different prefill levels, i.e., no prefill, low prefill (100 ml saline), and high
      prefill (individually adapted to the sensations of persistent strong desire to
      void), and with different infusion temperatures, i.e., body warm ( approximately 
      37 degrees C) or ice cold (4-8 degrees C) saline solution. During Increased
      distention pressure on the viscera, the insula, striatum, anterior cingulate,
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdalo-hippocampus, thalamus, brainstem, and
      cerebellar components showed increased activation. A second group of components
      encompassing the insula and anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal and
      posterior parietal cortices and temporal-parietal junction showed increased
      activity with innocuous temperature stimulation of bladder mucosa. Significant
      differences in the FNC were found between the insula and amygdalo-hippocampus,
      the insula and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the ventromedial prefrontal
      cortex and temporal-parietal junction as the distention pressure on the viscera
      increased. These results provide new insight into the supraspinal processing of
      visceral interoception originating from an internal organ. Hum Brain Mapp

AB  - Important decisions are often made under stressful circumstances that might
      compromise self-regulatory behavior. Yet the neural mechanisms by which stress
      influences self-control choices are unclear. We investigated these mechanisms in 
      human participants who faced self-control dilemmas over food reward while
      undergoing fMRI following stress. We found that stress increased the influence of
      immediately rewarding taste attributes on choice and reduced self-control. This
      choice pattern was accompanied by increased functional connectivity between
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala and striatal regions encoding
      tastiness. Furthermore, stress was associated with reduced connectivity between
      the vmPFC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex regions linked to self-control
      success. Notably, alterations in connectivity pathways could be dissociated by
      their differential relationships with cortisol and perceived stress. Our results 
      indicate that stress may compromise self-control decisions by both enhancing the 
      impact of immediately rewarding attributes and reducing the efficacy of regions
      promoting behaviors that are consistent with long-term goals.
