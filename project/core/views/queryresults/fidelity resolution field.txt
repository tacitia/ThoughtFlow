TI  - Fabrication of anisotropically arrayed nano-slots metasurfaces using reflective
      plasmonic lithography.
PG  - 18805-12
LID - 10.1039/c5nr05153c [doi]
AB  - Nanofabrication technology with high-resolution, high-throughput and low-cost is 
      essential for the development of nanoplasmonic and nanophotonic devices. At
      present, most metasurfaces are fabricated in a point by point writing manner with
      electron beam lithography or a focused ion beam, which imposes a serious cost
      barrier with respect to practical applications. Near field optical lithography,
      seemingly providing a high-resolution and low-cost way, however, suffers from the
      ultra shallow depth and poor fidelity of obtained photoresist patterns due to the
      exponential decay feature of evanescent waves. Here, we propose a method of
      surface plasmonic imaging lithography by introducing a reflective plasmonic lens 
      to amplify and compensate evanescent waves, resulting in the production of nano
      resist patterns with high fidelity, contrast and enhanced depth beyond that
      usually obtained by near field optical lithography. As examples, a discrete and
      anisotropically arrayed nano-slots mask pattern with different orientations and a
      size of 40 nm x 120 nm could be imaged in photoresist and transferred
      successfully onto a metal layer through an etching process. Evidence for the
      pattern quality is given by virtue of the fabricated metasurface lens devices
      showing good focusing performance in experiments. It is believed that this method
      provides a parallel, low-cost, high-throughput and large-area nanofabrication
      route for fabricating nanostructures of holograms, vortex phase plates,
      bio-sensors and solar cells etc.

TI  - Generation of high-quality parabolic pulses with optimized duration and energy by
      use of dispersive frequency-to-time mapping.
PG  - 27751-62
LID - 10.1364/OE.23.027751 [doi]
AB  - We propose and demonstrate a novel linear-optics method for high-fidelity
      parabolic pulse generation with durations ranging from the picosecond to the
      sub-nanosecond range. This method is based on dispersion-induced
      frequency-to-time mapping combined with spectral shaping in order to overcome
      constraints of previous linear shaping approaches. Temporal waveform distortions 
      associated with the need to satisfy a far-field condition are eliminated by use
      of a virtual time-lens process, which is directly implemented in the linear
      spectral shaping stage. Using this approach, the generated parabolic pulses are
      able to maintain most energy spectrum available from the input pulse frequency
      bandwidth, regardless of the target pulse duration, which is not anymore limited 
      by the finest spectral resolution of the optical pulse spectrum shaper.
      High-quality parabolic pulses, with durations from 25ps to 400ps and output
      powers exceeding 4dBm before amplification, have been experimentally synthesized 
      from a picosecond mode-locked optical source using a commercial optical pulse
      shaper with a frequency resolution >10GHz. In particular, we report the synthesis
      of full-duty cycle parabolic pulses that match up almost exactly with an ideal
      fitting over the entire pulse period.

TI  - High fidelity digital inline holographic method for 3D flow measurements.
PG  - 27159-73
LID - 10.1364/OE.23.027159 [doi]
AB  - Among all the 3D optical flow diagnostic techniques, digital inline holographic
      particle tracking velocimetry (DIH-PTV) provides the highest spatial resolution
      with low cost, simple and compact optical setups. Despite these advantages,
      DIH-PTV suffers from major limitations including poor longitudinal resolution,
      human intervention (i.e. requirement for manually determined tuning parameters
      during tracer field reconstruction and extraction), limited tracer concentration,
      and expensive computations. These limitations prevent this technique from being
      widely used for high resolution 3D flow measurements. In this study, we present a
      novel holographic particle extraction method with the goal of overcoming all the 
      major limitations of DIH-PTV. The proposed method consists of multiple steps
      involving 3D deconvolution, automatic signal-to-noise ratio enhancement and
      thresholding, and inverse iterative particle extraction. The entire method is
      implemented using GPU-based algorithm to increase the computational speed
      significantly. Validated with synthetic particle holograms, the proposed method
      can achieve particle extraction rate above 95% with fake particles less than 3%
      and maximum position error below 1.6 particle diameter for holograms with
      particle concentration above 3000 particles/mm<sup>3</sup>. The applicability of 
      the proposed method for DIH-PTV has been further validated using the experiment
      of laminar flow in a microchannel and the synthetic tracer flow fields generated 
      using a DNS turbulent channel flow database. Such improvements will substantially
      enhance the implementation of DIH-PTV for 3D flow measurements and enable the
      potential commercialization of this technique.

TI  - Light-Induced Surface Patterning of Silica.
PG  - 9837-48
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.5b03946 [doi]
AB  - Manipulating the size and shape of silica precursor patterns using simple
      far-field light irradiation and transforming such reconfigured structures into
      inorganic silica patterns by pyrolytic conversion are demonstrated. The key
      concept of our work is the use of an azobenzene incorporated silica precursor
      (herein, we refer to this material as azo-silane composite) as ink in a
      micromolding process. The moving direction of azo-silane composite is parallel to
      light polarization direction; in addition, the amount of azo-silane composite
      movement can be precisely determined by controlling light irradiation time. By
      exploiting this peculiar phenomenon, azo-silane composite patterns produced using
      the micromolding technique are arbitrarily manipulated to obtain various
      structural features including high-resolution size or sophisticated shape. The
      photoreconfigured patterns formed with azo-silane composites are then converted
      into pure silica patterns through pyrolytic conversion. The pyrolytic converted
      silica patterns are uniformly formed over a large area, ensuring crack-free
      formation and providing high structural fidelity. Therefore, this optical
      manipulation technique, in conjunction with the pyrolytic conversion process,
      opens a promising route to the design of silica patterns with finely tuned
      structural features in terms of size and shape. This platform for designing
      silica structures has significant value in various nanotechnology fields
      including micro/nanofluidic channel for lab-on-a-chip devices, transparent
      superhydrophobic surfaces, and optoelectronic devices.

TI  - Direct Coherent Raman Temperature Imaging and Wideband Chemical Detection in a
      Hydrocarbon Flat Flame.
PG  - 643-9
LID - 10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b00014 [doi]
AB  - A single-shot coherent Raman imaging technique has been developed for spatially
      correlated one-dimensional high-fidelity gas-phase thermometry and multiplex
      chemical detection in flames. The technique utilizes two-beam phase matching,
      operating a single ultrashort pump/Stokes excitation pulse (7 fs) and a
      narrowband picosecond probe pulse (70 ps), interrogating a Raman active window of
      approximately 4200 cm(-1) with approximately 0.3 cm(-1) spectral resolution. The 
      measurement geometry is formed intersecting the two beams shaped as laser-sheets 
      and the one-coordinate spatial information is retrieved with a linespread
      function of <40 mum. The advance provides the possibility for the multiplexed
      measurement of all combustion relevant major species simultaneously with gaseous 
      temperature monitored over a several millimeter field of view. The current
      technique is optimized in a premixed hydrocarbon flat-flame. At the flame-front, 
      it is shown that direct imaging renders the temperature profile within
      approximately 1% inaccuracy, whereas typical point-wise raster scanning may have 
      relative systematic deviations up to 15% due to spatial averaging effects.

TI  - Multiscale reconstruction for MR fingerprinting.
LID - 10.1002/mrm.25776 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To reduce the acquisition time needed to obtain reliable parametric maps
      with Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting. METHODS: An iterative-denoising algorithm
      is initialized by reconstructing the MRF image series at low image resolution.
      For subsequent iterations, the method enforces pixel-wise fidelity to the
      best-matching dictionary template then enforces fidelity to the acquired data at 
      slightly higher spatial resolution. After convergence, parametric maps with
      desirable spatial resolution are obtained through template matching of the final 
      image series. The proposed method was evaluated on phantom and in vivo data using
      the highly undersampled, variable-density spiral trajectory and compared with the
      original MRF method. The benefits of additional sparsity constraints were also
      evaluated. When available, gold standard parameter maps were used to quantify the
      performance of each method. RESULTS: The proposed approach allowed convergence to
      accurate parametric maps with as few as 300 time points of acquisition, as
      compared to 1000 in the original MRF work. Simultaneous quantification of T1, T2,
      proton density (PD), and B0 field variations in the brain was achieved in vivo
      for a 256 x 256 matrix for a total acquisition time of 10.2 s, representing a
      three-fold reduction in acquisition time. CONCLUSION: The proposed iterative
      multiscale reconstruction reliably increases MRF acquisition speed and accuracy.

AB  - High field MRI has been applied to high-resolution structural and functional
      imaging of the brain. Echo planar imaging (EPI) is an ultrafast acquisition
      technique widely used in diffusion imaging, functional MRI and perfusion imaging.
      However, it suffers from geometric and intensity distortions caused by static
      magnetic field inhomogeneity, which is worse at higher field strengths. Such
      susceptibility artifacts are particularly severe in relation to the small size of
      the mouse brain. In this study we compared different distortion correction
      methods, including nonlinear registration, field map-based, and reversed
      phase-encoding-based approaches, on quantitative imaging of T1 and perfusion in
      the mouse brain acquired by spin-echo EPI with inversion recovery and
      pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling, respectively, at 7T. Our results showed
      that the 3D reversed phase-encoding correction outperformed other methods in
      terms of geometric fidelity, and that conventional field map-based correction
      could be improved by combination with affine transformation to reduce the bias in
      the field map. Both methods improved quantification with smaller fitting error
      and regional variation. These approaches offer robust correction of EPI
      distortions at high field strengths and hence could lead to more accurate
      co-registration and quantification of imaging biomarkers in both clinical and
      preclinical applications.

TI  - Gradient-induced voltages on 12-lead ECGs during high duty-cycle MRI sequences
      and a method for their removal considering linear and concomitant gradient terms.
LID - 10.1002/mrm.25810 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To restore 12-lead electrocardiographic (ECG) signal fidelity inside MRI
      by removing magnetic field gradient-induced voltages during high gradient duty
      cycle sequences. THEORY AND METHODS: A theoretical equation was derived to
      provide first- and second-order electrical fields induced at individual ECG
      electrodes as a function of gradient fields. Experiments were performed at 3T on 
      healthy volunteers using a customized acquisition system that captured the full
      amplitude and frequency response of ECGs, or a commercial recording system. The
      19 equation coefficients were derived via linear regression of data from
      accelerated sequences and were used to compute induced voltages in real-time
      during full resolution sequences to remove ECG artifacts. Restored traces were
      evaluated relative to ones acquired without imaging. RESULTS: Measured induced
      voltages were 0.7 V peak-to-peak during balanced steady state free precession
      (bSSFP) with the heart at the isocenter. Applying the equation during gradient
      echo sequencing, three-dimensional fast spin echo, and multislice bSSFP imaging
      restored nonsaturated traces and second-order concomitant terms showed larger
      contributions in electrodes further from the magnet isocenter. Equation
      coefficients are evaluated with high repeatability (rho = 0.996) and are
      dependent on subject, sequence, and slice orientation. CONCLUSION: Close
      agreement between theoretical and measured gradient-induced voltages allowed for 
      real-time removal. Prospective estimation of sequence periods in which large
      induced voltages occur may allow hardware removal of these signals. Magn Reson

TI  - Applications and challenges of digital pathology and whole slide imaging.
PG  - 341-7

AB  - Virtual microscopy is a method for digitizing images of tissue on glass slides
      and using a computer to view, navigate, change magnification, focus and mark
      areas of interest. Virtual microscope systems (also called digital pathology or
      whole slide imaging systems) offer several advantages for biological scientists
      who use slides as part of their general, pharmaceutical, biotechnology or
      clinical research. The systems usually are based on one of two methodologies:
      area scanning or line scanning. Virtual microscope systems enable automatic
      sample detection, virtual-Z acquisition and creation of focal maps. Virtual
      slides are layered with multiple resolutions at each location, including the
      highest resolution needed to allow more detailed review of specific regions of
      interest. Scans may be acquired at 2, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 100 x or a combination
      of magnifications to highlight important detail. Digital microscopy starts when a
      slide collection is put into an automated or manual scanning system. The original
      slides are archived, then a server allows users to review multilayer digital
      images of the captured slides either by a closed network or by the internet. One 
      challenge for adopting the technology is the lack of a universally accepted file 
      format for virtual slides. Additional challenges include maintaining focus in an 
      uneven sample, detecting specimens accurately, maximizing color fidelity with
      optimal brightness and contrast, optimizing resolution and keeping the images
      artifact-free. There are several manufacturers in the field and each has not only
      its own approach to these issues, but also its own image analysis software, which
      provides many options for users to enhance the speed, quality and accuracy of
      their process through virtual microscopy. Virtual microscope systems are widely
      used and are trusted to provide high quality solutions for teleconsultation,
      education, quality control, archiving, veterinary medicine, research and other
      fields.

TI  - A field camera for MR sequence monitoring and system analysis.
LID - 10.1002/mrm.25770 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: MR image formation and interpretation relies on highly accurate dynamic 
      magnetic fields of high fidelity. A range of mechanisms still limit magnetic
      field fidelity, including magnet drifts, eddy currents, and finite linearity and 
      stability of power amplifiers used to drive gradient and shim coils. Addressing
      remaining errors by means of hardware, sequence, or signal processing
      optimizations, calls for immediate observation by magnetic field monitoring. The 
      present work presents a stand-alone monitoring system delivering insight into
      such field imperfections for MR sequence and system analysis. METHODS: A flexible
      NMR field probe-based stand-alone monitoring system, built on a
      software-defined-radio approach, is introduced and used to sense field dynamics
      up to third-order in space in a selection of situations with different time
      scales. RESULTS: Highly sensitive trajectories are measured and successfully used
      for image reconstruction. Further field perturbations due to mechanical
      oscillations and thermal field drifts following demanding gradient use and
      external interferences are studied. CONCLUSION: A flexible and versatile
      monitoring system is presented, delivering camera-like access to otherwise hardly
      accessible field dynamics with nanotesla resolution. Its stand-alone nature
      enables field analysis even during unknown MR system states. Magn Reson Med,

TI  - Mapping pixel dissimilarity in wide-field super-resolution fluorescence
      microscopy.
PG  - 4675-82
LID - 10.1021/ac504295p [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in fluorescence bioimaging with single-molecule sensitivity have 
      relied on the analysis and visualization of single-molecule data obtained on
      smart fluorophores. We describe an alternative method to enhance the information 
      content of densely labeled fluorescence images. Visualization is improved by
      representing pixels as the dissimilarities of the fluctuations of the
      fluorescence signals, with the dissimilarity being taken to the mean of the
      signals over all the pixels. Mapping pixel dissimilarity (Mappix) results in
      signal and information enhancement of the output images. In addition, the spatial
      distribution of the fluorescence brightness of the original image is not skewed. 
      This allows large differences of molecular brightness to be handled which turns
      out to be critical to the fidelity of the final image. In this work, we provide
      testing of the Mappix approach with both simulated and real data. The results
      obtained on HEK cells expressing Dronpa photoswitchable fluorescent protein show 
      that, for densely labeled samples, improvement can be obtained on fluorescence
      images allowing the observation of structural information. Despite some
      limitations, comparison to state of art methods reveals that Mappix can be very
      useful for biological imaging applications.

TI  - Simultaneous multi-slice Turbo-FLASH imaging with CAIPIRINHA for whole brain
      distortion-free pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling at 3 and 7 T.
PG  - 279-88
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.060 [doi]
LID - S1053-8119(15)00256-6 [pii]
AB  - Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) imaging has recently been
      attempted for arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI in conjunction with
      echo-planar imaging (EPI) readout. It was found that SMS-EPI can reduce the T1
      relaxation effect of the label and improve image coverage and resolution with
      little penalty in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, EPI still suffers from
      geometric distortion and signal dropout from field inhomogeneity effects
      especially at high and ultrahigh magnetic fields. Here we present a novel scheme 
      for achieving high fidelity distortion-free quantitative perfusion imaging by
      combining pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) with SMS Turbo-FLASH (TFL) readout at
      both 3 and 7 T. Bloch equation simulation was performed to characterize and
      optimize the TFL-based pCASL perfusion signal. Two MB factors (3 and 5) were
      implemented in SMS-TFL pCASL and compared with standard 2D TFL and EPI pCASL
      sequences. The temporal SNR of SMS-TFL pCASL relative to that of standard TFL
      pCASL was 0.76 +/- 0.10 and 0.74 +/- 0.11 at 7 T and 0.70 +/- 0.05 and 0.65 +/-
      0.05 at 3T for MB factor of 3 and 5, respectively. By implementing background
      suppression in conjunction with SMS-TFL at 3T, the relative temporal SNR improved
      to 0.84 +/- 0.09 and 0.79 +/- 0.10 for MB factor of 3 and 5, respectively.
      Compared to EPI pCASL, significantly increased temporal SNR (p<0.001) and
      improved visualization of orbitofrontal cortex were achieved using SMS-TFL pCASL.
      By combining SMS acceleration with TFL pCASL, we demonstrated the feasibility for
      whole brain distortion-free quantitative mapping of cerebral blood flow at high
      and ultrahigh magnetic fields.

TI  - Transmission of photonic quantum polarization entanglement in a nanoscale hybrid 
      plasmonic waveguide.
PG  - 2380-4
LID - 10.1021/nl504636x [doi]
AB  - Photonic quantum technologies have been extensively studied in quantum
      information science, owing to the high-speed transmission and outstanding
      low-noise properties of photons. However, applications based on photonic
      entanglement are restricted due to the diffraction limit. In this work, we
      demonstrate for the first time the maintaining of quantum polarization
      entanglement in a nanoscale hybrid plasmonic waveguide composed of a fiber taper 
      and a silver nanowire. The transmitted state throughout the waveguide has a
      fidelity of 0.932 with the maximally polarization entangled state Phi(+).
      Furthermore, the Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt (CHSH) inequality test
      performed, resulting in value of 2.495 +/- 0.147 > 2, demonstrates the violation 
      of the hidden variable model. Because the plasmonic waveguide confines the
      effective mode area to subwavelength scale, it can bridge nanophotonics and
      quantum optics and may be used as near-field quantum probe in a quantum
      near-field micro/nanoscope, which can realize high spatial resolution,
      ultrasensitive, fiber-integrated, and plasmon-enhanced detection.

TI  - Analysis of iterative region-of-interest image reconstruction for x-ray computed 
      tomography.
PG  - 031007
AB  - One of the challenges for iterative image reconstruction (IIR) is that such
      algorithms solve an imaging model implicitly, requiring a complete representation
      of the scanned subject within the viewing domain of the scanner. This requirement
      can place a prohibitively high computational burden for IIR applied to x-ray
      computed tomography (CT), especially when high-resolution tomographic volumes are
      required. In this work, we aim to develop an IIR algorithm for direct
      region-of-interest (ROI) image reconstruction. The proposed class of IIR
      algorithms is based on an optimization problem that incorporates a data fidelity 
      term, which compares a derivative of the estimated data with the available
      projection data. In order to characterize this optimization problem, we apply it 
      to computer-simulated two-dimensional fan-beam CT data, using both ideal
      noiseless data and realistic data containing a level of noise comparable to that 
      of the breast CT application. The proposed method is demonstrated for both
      complete field-of-view and ROI imaging. To demonstrate the potential utility of
      the proposed ROI imaging method, it is applied to actual CT scanner data.

AB  - Recent advances in MRI acquisition for microscopic flows enable unprecedented
      sensitivity and speed in a portable NMR/MRI microfluidic analysis platform.
      However, the application of MRI to microfluidics usually suffers from prolonged
      acquisition times owing to the combination of the required high resolution and
      wide field of view necessary to resolve details within microfluidic channels.
      When prior knowledge of the image geometry is available as a binarized image,
      such as for microfluidic MRI, it is possible to reduce sampling requirements by
      incorporating this information into the reconstruction algorithm. The current
      approach to the design of the partial weighted random sampling schemes is to bias
      toward the high signal energy portions of the binarized image geometry after
      Fourier transformation (i.e. in its k-space representation). Although this
      sampling prescription is frequently effective, it can be far from optimal in
      certain limiting cases, such as for a 1D channel, or more generally yield
      inefficient sampling schemes at low degrees of sub-sampling. This work explores
      the tradeoff between signal acquisition and incoherent sampling on image
      reconstruction quality given prior knowledge of the image geometry for weighted
      random sampling schemes, finding that optimal distribution is not robustly
      determined by maximizing the acquired signal but from interpreting its marginal
      change with respect to the sub-sampling rate. We develop a corresponding sampling
      design methodology that deterministically yields a near optimal sampling
      distribution for image reconstructions incorporating knowledge of the image
      geometry. The technique robustly identifies optimal weighted random sampling
      schemes and provides improved reconstruction fidelity for multiple 1D and 2D
      images, when compared to prior techniques for sampling optimization given
      knowledge of the image geometry.

TI  - Interleaved EPI based fMRI improved by multiplexed sensitivity encoding (MUSE)
      and simultaneous multi-band imaging.
PG  - e116378
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0116378 [doi]
AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive and powerful
      imaging tool for detecting brain activities. The majority of fMRI studies are
      performed with single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) due to its high temporal
      resolution. Recent studies have demonstrated that, by increasing the
      spatial-resolution of fMRI, previously unidentified neuronal networks can be
      measured. However, it is challenging to improve the spatial resolution of
      conventional single-shot EPI based fMRI. Although multi-shot interleaved EPI is
      superior to single-shot EPI in terms of the improved spatial-resolution, reduced 
      geometric distortions, and sharper point spread function (PSF), interleaved EPI
      based fMRI has two main limitations: 1) the imaging throughput is lower in
      interleaved EPI; 2) the magnitude and phase signal variations among EPI segments 
      (due to physiological noise, subject motion, and B0 drift) are translated to
      significant in-plane aliasing artifact across the field of view (FOV). Here we
      report a method that integrates multiple approaches to address the technical
      limitations of interleaved EPI-based fMRI. Firstly, the multiplexed
      sensitivity-encoding (MUSE) post-processing algorithm is used to suppress
      in-plane aliasing artifacts resulting from time-domain signal instabilities
      during dynamic scans. Secondly, a simultaneous multi-band interleaved EPI pulse
      sequence, with a controlled aliasing scheme incorporated, is implemented to
      increase the imaging throughput. Thirdly, the MUSE algorithm is then generalized 
      to accommodate fMRI data obtained with our multi-band interleaved EPI pulse
      sequence, suppressing both in-plane and through-plane aliasing artifacts. The
      blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal detectability and the scan
      throughput can be significantly improved for interleaved EPI-based fMRI. Our
      human fMRI data obtained from 3 Tesla systems demonstrate the effectiveness of
      the developed methods. It is expected that future fMRI studies requiring high
      spatial-resolvability and fidelity will largely benefit from the reported
      techniques.

TI  - A frequency and amplitude scanned quadrupole mass filter for the analysis of high
      m/z ions.
PG  - 113109
LID - 10.1063/1.4900627 [doi]
AB  - Quadrupole mass filters (QMFs) are usually not used to analyze high m/z ions, due
      to the low frequency resonant circuit that is required to drive them. Here we
      describe a new approach to generating waveforms for QMFs. Instead of scanning the
      amplitude of a sine wave to measure the m/z spectrum, the frequency of a
      trapezoidal wave is digitally scanned. A synchronous, narrow-range (<0.2%)
      amplitude scan overlays the frequency scan to improve the sampling resolution.
      Because the frequency is the primary quantity that is scanned, there is, in
      principle, no upper m/z limit. The frequency signal is constructed from a
      stabilized base clock using a field programmable gate array. This signal drives
      integrating amplifiers which generate the trapezoidal waves. For a trapezoidal
      wave the harmonics can be minimized by selecting the appropriate rise and fall
      times. To achieve a high resolving power, the digital signal has low jitter, and 
      the trapezoidal waveform is generated with high fidelity. The QMF was
      characterized with cesium iodide clusters. Singly and multiply charged clusters
      with z up to +5 were observed. A resolving power of approximately 1200 (FWHM) was
      demonstrated over a broad m/z range. Resolution was lost above 20,000 Th, partly 
      because of congestion due to overlapping multiply charged clusters. Ions were
      observed for m/z values well in excess of 150,000 Th.

TI  - Deformable 3D-2D registration for CT and its application to low dose tomographic 
      fluoroscopy.
PG  - 7865-87
LID - 10.1088/0031-9155/59/24/7865 [doi]
AB  - Many applications in medical imaging include image registration for matching of
      images from the same or different modalities. In the case of full data sampling, 
      the respective reconstructed images are usually of such a good image quality that
      standard deformable volume-to-volume (3D-3D) registration approaches can be
      applied. But research in temporal-correlated image reconstruction and dose
      reductions increases the number of cases where rawdata are available from only
      few projection angles. Here, deteriorated image quality leads to non-acceptable
      deformable volume-to-volume registration results. Therefore a registration
      approach is required that is robust against a decreasing number of projections
      defining the target position. We propose a deformable volume-to-rawdata (3D-2D)
      registration method that aims at finding a displacement vector field maximizing
      the alignment of a CT volume and the acquired rawdata based on the sum of squared
      differences in rawdata domain. The registration is constrained by a
      regularization term in accordance with a fluid-based diffusion. Both cost
      function components, the rawdata fidelity and the regularization term, are
      optimized in an alternating manner. The matching criterion is optimized by a
      conjugate gradient descent for nonlinear functions, while the regularization is
      realized by convolution of the vector fields with Gaussian kernels. We validate
      the proposed method and compare it to the demons algorithm, a well-known 3D-3D
      registration method. The comparison is done for a range of 4-60 target
      projections using datasets from low dose tomographic fluoroscopy as an
      application example. The results show a high correlation to the ground truth
      target position without introducing artifacts even in the case of very few
      projections. In particular the matching in the rawdata domain is improved
      compared to the 3D-3D registration for the investigated range. The proposed
      volume-to-rawdata registration increases the robustness regarding sparse rawdata 
      and provides more stable results than volume-to-volume approaches. By applying
      the proposed registration approach to low dose tomographic fluoroscopy it is
      possible to improve the temporal resolution and thus to increase the robustness
      of low dose tomographic fluoroscopy.

PG  - 1397-405
LID - 10.1002/mrm.25521 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Strict regulations are imposed on the amount of radiofrequency (RF)
      energy that devices can emit to prevent excessive deposition of RF energy into
      the body. In this study, we investigated the application of MR temperature
      mapping and 10-g average specific absorption rate (SAR) computation for safety
      evaluation of RF-emitting devices. METHODS: Quantification of the RF power
      deposition was shown for an MRI-compatible dipole antenna and a
      non-MRI-compatible mobile phone via phantom temperature change measurements.
      Validation of the MR temperature mapping method was demonstrated by comparison
      with physical temperature measurements and electromagnetic field simulations. MR 
      temperature measurements alongside physical property measurements were used to
      reconstruct 10-g average SAR. RESULTS: The maximum temperature change for a
      dipole antenna and the maximum 10-g average SAR were 1.83 degrees C and 12.4
      W/kg, respectively, for simulations and 1.73 degrees C and 11.9 W/kg,
      respectively, for experiments. The difference between MR and probe thermometry
      was <0.15 degrees C. The maximum temperature change and the maximum 10-g average 
      SAR for a cell phone radiating at maximum output for 15 min was 1.7 degrees C and
      0.54 W/kg, respectively. CONCLUSION: Information acquired using MR temperature
      mapping and thermal property measurements can assess RF/microwave safety with
      high resolution and fidelity. Magn Reson Med 74:1397-1405, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley

AB  - Genetically encoded voltage sensors expand the optogenetics toolkit into the
      important realm of electrical recording, enabling researchers to study the
      dynamic activity of complex neural circuits in real time. However, these probes
      have thus far performed poorly when tested in intact neural circuits. Hybrid
      voltage sensors (hVOS) enable the imaging of voltage by harnessing the resonant
      energy transfer that occurs between a genetically encoded component, a
      membrane-tethered fluorescent protein that serves as a donor, and a small charged
      molecule, dipicrylamine, which serves as an acceptor. hVOS generates optical
      signals as a result of voltage-induced changes in donor-acceptor distance. We
      expressed the hVOS probe in mouse brain by in utero electroporation and in
      transgenic mice with a neuronal promoter. Under conditions favoring sparse
      labeling we could visualize single-labeled neurons. hVOS imaging reported
      electrically evoked fluorescence changes from individual neurons in slices from
      entorhinal cortex, somatosensory cortex, and hippocampus. These fluorescence
      signals tracked action potentials in individual neurons in a single trial with
      excellent temporal fidelity, producing changes that exceeded background noise by 
      as much as 16-fold. Subthreshold synaptic potentials were detected in single
      trials in multiple distinct cells simultaneously. We followed signal propagation 
      between different cells within one field of view and between dendrites and somata
      of the same cell. hVOS imaging thus provides a tool for high-resolution recording
      of electrical activity from genetically targeted cells in intact neuronal
      circuits.

PG  - 400-11
LID - 10.1159/000365273 [doi]
AB  - The cochlear implant (CI) has been labeled the most successful neural prosthesis.
      Despite this success, a significant number of CI recipients experience poor
      speech understanding, and, even among the best performers, restoration to normal 
      auditory fidelity is rare. While significant research efforts have been devoted
      to improving stimulation strategies, few developments have led to significant
      hearing improvement over the past two decades. We have recently introduced image 
      processing techniques that open a new direction for advancement in this field by 
      making it possible, for the first time, to determine the position of implanted CI
      electrodes relative to the nerves they stimulate using computed tomography
      images. In this article, we present results of an image-guided,
      patient-customized approach to stimulation that utilizes the electrode position
      information our image processing techniques provide. This approach allows us to
      identify electrodes that cause overlapping stimulation patterns and to deactivate
      them from a patient's map. This individualized mapping strategy yields
      significant improvement in speech understanding in both quiet and noise as well
      as improved spectral resolution in the 68 adult CI recipients studied to date.
      Our results indicate that image guidance can improve hearing outcomes for many
      existing CI recipients without requiring additional surgery or the use of
      'experimental' stimulation strategies, hardware or software.

TI  - The Q Exactive HF, a Benchtop mass spectrometer with a pre-filter,
      high-performance quadrupole and an ultra-high-field Orbitrap analyzer.
PG  - 3698-708
LID - 10.1074/mcp.M114.043489 [doi]
AB  - The quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive) made a powerful proteomics
      instrument available in a benchtop format. It significantly boosted the number of
      proteins analyzable per hour and has now evolved into a proteomics analysis
      workhorse for many laboratories. Here we describe the Q Exactive Plus and Q
      Exactive HF mass spectrometers, which feature several innovations in comparison
      to the original Q Exactive instrument. A low-resolution pre-filter has been
      implemented within the injection flatapole, preventing unwanted ions from
      entering deep into the system, and thereby increasing its robustness. A new
      segmented quadrupole, with higher fidelity of isolation efficiency over a wide
      range of isolation windows, provides an almost 2-fold improvement of transmission
      at narrow isolation widths. Additionally, the Q Exactive HF has a compact
      Orbitrap analyzer, leading to higher field strength and almost doubling the
      resolution at the same transient times. With its very fast isolation and
      fragmentation capabilities, the instrument achieves overall cycle times of 1 s
      for a top 15 to 20 higher energy collisional dissociation method. We demonstrate 
      the identification of 5000 proteins in standard 90-min gradients of tryptic
      digests of mammalian cell lysate, an increase of over 40% for detected peptides
      and over 20% for detected proteins. Additionally, we tested the instrument on
      peptide phosphorylation enriched samples, for which an improvement of up to 60%
      class I sites was observed.

      magnetic field directed self-assembly.
PG  - 11977-86
LID - 10.1021/nn505037b [doi]
AB  - There is long-standing interest in developing membranes possessing uniform pores 
      with dimensions in the range of 1 nm and physical continuity in the macroscopic
      transport direction to meet the needs of challenging small molecule and ionic
      separations. Here we report facile, scalabe fabrication of polymer membranes with
      vertically (i.e., along the through-plane direction) aligned 1 nm pores by
      magnetic-field alignment and subsequent cross-linking of a liquid crystalline
      mesophase. We utilize a wedge-shaped amphiphilic species as the building block of
      a thermotropic columnar mesophase with 1 nm ionic nanochannels, and leverage the 
      magnetic anisotropy of the amphiphile to control the alignment of these pores
      with a magnetic field. In situ X-ray scattering and subsequent optical microscopy
      reveal the formation of highly ordered nanostructured mesophases and cross-linked
      polymer films with orientational order parameters of ca. 0.95. High-resolution
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging provides direct visualization of
      long-range persistence of vertically aligned, hexagonally packed nanopores in
      unprecedented detail, demonstrating high-fidelity retention of structure and
      alignment after photo-cross-linking. Ionic conductivity measurements on the
      aligned membranes show a remarkable 85-fold enhancement of conductivity over
      nonaligned samples. These results provide a path to achieving the large area
      control of morphology and related enhancement of properties required for
      high-performance membranes and other applications.

LID - S1053-8119(14)00664-8 [pii]
AB  - Post-mortem diffusion imaging of whole, human brains has potential to provide
      data for validation or high-resolution anatomical investigations. Previous work
      has demonstrated improvements in data acquired with diffusion-weighted
      steady-state free precession (DW-SSFP) compared with conventional
      diffusion-weighted spin echo at 3T. This is due to the ability of DW-SSFP to
      overcome signal-to-noise and diffusion contrast losses brought about by tissue
      fixation related decreases in T2 and ADC. In this work, data of four post-mortem 
      human brains were acquired at 3T and 7 T, using DW-SSFP with similar effective
      b-values (b(eff)~5150 s/mm(2)) for inter-field strength comparisons; in addition,
      DW-SSFP data were acquired at 7 T with higher b(eff) (~8550 s/mm(2)) for
      intra-field strength comparisons. Results demonstrate that both datasets acquired
      at 7 T had higher SNR and diffusion contrast than data acquired at 3T, and data
      acquired at higher b(eff) had improved diffusion contrast than at lower b(eff) at
      7 T. These results translate to improved estimates of secondary fiber
      orientations leading to higher fidelity tractography results compared with data
      acquired at 3T. Specifically, tractography streamlines of cortical projections
      originating from the corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, and superior
      longitudinal fasciculus were more successful at crossing the centrum semiovale
      and projected closer to the cortex. Results suggest that DW-SSFP at 7 T is a
      preferential method for acquiring diffusion-weighted data of post-mortem human
      brain, specifically where the primary region of interest involves crossing white 
      matter tracts.

AB  - We present a superpixel method for full spatial phase and amplitude control of a 
      light beam using a digital micromirror device (DMD) combined with a spatial
      filter. We combine square regions of nearby micromirrors into superpixels by low 
      pass filtering in a Fourier plane of the DMD. At each superpixel we are able to
      independently modulate the phase and the amplitude of light, while retaining a
      high resolution and the very high speed of a DMD. The method achieves a measured 
      fidelity F = 0.98 for a target field with fully independent phase and amplitude
      at a resolution of 8 x 8 pixels per diffraction limited spot. For the LG10
      orbital angular momentum mode the calculated fidelity is F = 0.99993, using 768 x
      768 DMD pixels. The superpixel method reduces the errors when compared to the
      state of the art Lee holography method for these test fields by 50% and 18%, with
      a comparable light efficiency of around 5%. Our control software is publicly
      available.

      acquisition and reconstruction. In this work, the authors propose a novel
      spatial-temporal compressed sensing (CS) imaging strategy for the real time
      MRI--prior data assisted compressed sensing (PDACS), which aims to improve the
      image quality of the conventional CS without significantly increasing
      reconstruction times. METHODS: Conventional 2D CS requires a random sampling of
      partial k-space data, as well as an iterative reconstruction that simultaneously 
      enforces the image's sparsity in a transform domain as well as maintains the
      fidelity to the acquired k-space. PDACS method requires the additional
      acquisition of the prior data, and for reconstruction, it additionally enforces
      fidelity to the prior k-space domain similar to viewsharing. In this work, the
      authors evaluated the proposed PDACS method by comparing its results to those
      obtained from the 2D CS and viewsharing methods when performed individually. All 
      three methods are used to reconstruct images from lung cancer patients whose
      tumors move and who are likely to benefit from lung tumor tracking. The patients 
      are scanned, using a 3T MRI, under free breathing using the fully sampled k-space
      with 2D dynamic bSSFP sequence in a sagittal plane containing lung tumor. These
      images form a reference set for the evaluation of the partial k-space methods. To
      create partial k-space, the fully sampled k-space is retrospectively undersampled
      to obtain a range of acquisition acceleration factors, and reconstructed with
      2D-CS, PDACS, and viewshare methods. For evaluation, metrics assessing global
      image artifacts as well as tumor contour shape fidelity are determined from the
      reconstructed images. These analyses are performed both for the original 3T
      images and those at a simulated 0.5T equivalent noise level. RESULTS: In the 3.0T
      images, the PDACS strategy is shown to give superior results compared to
      viewshare and conventional 2D CS using all metrics. The 2D-CS tends to perform
      better than viewshare at the low acceleration factors, while the opposite is true
      at the high acceleration factors. At simulated 0.5T images, PDACS method performs
      only marginally better than the viewsharing method, both of which are superior
      compared to 2D CS. The PDACS image reconstruction time (0.3 s/image) is similar
      to that of the conventional 2D CS. CONCLUSIONS: The PDACS method can potentially 
      improve the real time tracking of moving tumors by significantly increasing MRI's
      data acquisition speeds. In 3T images, the PDACS method does provide a benefit
      over the other two methods in terms of both the overall image quality and the
      ability to accurately and automatically contour the tumor shape. MRI's data
      acquisition may be accelerated using the simpler viewsharing strategy at the
      lower, 0.5T magnetic field, as the marginal benefit of the PDACS method may not
      justify its additional reconstruction times.

TI  - Scan time reduction for readout-segmented EPI using simultaneous multislice
      acceleration: Diffusion-weighted imaging at 3 and 7 Tesla.
LID - 10.1002/mrm.25391 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Readout-segmented echo-planar imaging (rs-EPI) can provide high quality 
      diffusion data because it is less prone to distortion and blurring artifacts than
      single-shot echo-planar imaging (ss-EPI), particularly at higher resolution and
      higher field. Readout segmentation allows shorter echo-spacing and echo train
      duration, resulting in reduced image distortion and blurring, respectively, in
      the phase-encoding direction. However, these benefits come at the expense of
      longer scan times because the segments are acquired in multiple repetitions times
      (TRs). This study shortened rs-EPI scan times by reducing the TR duration with
      simultaneous multislice acceleration. METHODS: The blipped-CAIPI method for slice
      acceleration with reduced g-factor SNR loss was incorporated into the
      diffusion-weighted rs-EPI sequence. The rs- and ss-EPI sequences were compared at
      a range of resolutions at both 3 and 7 Tesla in terms of image fidelity and
      diffusion postprocessing results. RESULTS: Slice-accelerated clinically useful
      trace-weighted images and tractography results are presented. Tractography
      analysis showed that the reduced artifacts in rs-EPI allowed better
      discrimination of tracts than ss-EPI. CONCLUSION: Slice acceleration reduces
      rs-EPI scan times providing a practical alternative to diffusion-weighted ss-EPI 
      with reduced distortion and high resolution. Magn Reson Med, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley

TI  - Battery-operated, portable, and flexible air microplasma generation device for
      fabrication of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices on demand.
PG  - 8757-62
LID - 10.1021/ac501945q [doi]
AB  - A portable microplasma generation device (MGD) operated in ambient air is
      introduced for making a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (muPAD) that
      serves as a primary healthcare platform. By utilizing a printed circuit board
      fabrication process, a flexible and lightweight MGD can be fabricated within 30
      min with ultra low-cost. This MGD can be driven by a portable power supply (less 
      than two pounds), which can be powered using 12 V-batteries or ac-dc converters. 
      This MGD is used to perform maskless patterning of hydrophilic patterns with
      sub-millimeter spatial resolution on hydrophobic paper substrates with good
      pattern transfer fidelity. Using this MGD to fabricate muPADs is demonstrated.
      With a proper design of the MGD electrode geometry, muPADs with 500-mum-wide flow
      channels can be fabricated within 1 min and with a cost of less than $USD
      0.05/device. We then test the muPADs by performing quantitative colorimetric
      assay tests and establish a calibration curve for detection of glucose and
      nitrite. The results show a linear response to a glucose assay for 1-50 mM and a 
      nitrite assay for 0.1-5 mM. The low cost, miniaturized, and portable MGD can be
      used to fabricate muPADs on demand, which is suitable for in-field diagnostic
      tests. We believe this concept brings impact to the field of biomedical analysis,
      environmental monitoring, and food safety survey.

AB  - Electron tomography using a high-voltage electron microscope (HVEM) provides
      three-dimensional information about cellular components in sections thicker than 
      1 mum, although in bright-field mode image degradation caused by multiple
      inelastic scattering of transmitted electrons limit the attainable resolution.
      Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is believed to give enhanced
      contrast and resolution compared to conventional transmission electron microscopy
      (CTEM). Samples up to 1 mum in thickness have been analyzed with an
      intermediate-voltage electron microscope because inelastic scattering is not a
      critical limitation, and probe broadening can be minimized. Here, we employed
      STEM at 1 MeV high-voltage to extend the useful specimen thickness for electron
      tomography, which we demonstrate by a seamless tomographic reconstruction of a
      whole, budding Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cell, which is ~3 mum in thickness.
      High-voltage STEM tomography, especially in the bright-field mode, demonstrated
      sufficiently enhanced contrast and intensity, compared to CTEM tomography, to
      permit segmentation of major organelles in the whole cell. STEM imaging also
      reduced specimen shrinkage during tilt-series acquisition. The fidelity of
      structural preservation was limited by cytoplasmic extraction, and the spatial
      resolution was limited by the relatively large convergence angle of the scanning 
      probe. However, the new technique has potential to solve longstanding problems of
      image blurring in biological specimens beyond 1 mum in thickness, and may
      facilitate new research in cellular structural biology.

TI  - Combined iterative reconstruction and image-domain decomposition for dual energy 
      CT using total-variation regularization.
PG  - 051909
LID - 10.1118/1.4870375 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Dual-energy CT (DECT) is being increasingly used for its capability of
      material decomposition and energy-selective imaging. A generic problem of DECT,
      however, is that the decomposition process is unstable in the sense that the
      relative magnitude of decomposed signals is reduced due to signal cancellation
      while the image noise is accumulating from the two CT images of independent
      scans. Direct image decomposition, therefore, leads to severe degradation of
      signal-to-noise ratio on the resultant images. Existing noise suppression
      techniques are typically implemented in DECT with the procedures of
      reconstruction and decomposition performed independently, which do not explore
      the statistical properties of decomposed images during the reconstruction for
      noise reduction. In this work, the authors propose an iterative approach that
      combines the reconstruction and the signal decomposition procedures to minimize
      the DECT image noise without noticeable loss of resolution. METHODS: The proposed
      algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem, which balances the data
      fidelity and total variation of decomposed images in one framework, and the
      decomposition step is carried out iteratively together with reconstruction. The
      noise in the CT images from the proposed algorithm becomes well correlated even
      though the noise of the raw projections is independent on the two CT scans. Due
      to this feature, the proposed algorithm avoids noise accumulation during the
      decomposition process. The authors evaluate the method performance on noise
      suppression and spatial resolution using phantom studies and compare the
      algorithm with conventional denoising approaches as well as combined iterative
      reconstruction methods with different forms of regularization. RESULTS: On the
      Catphan(c)600 phantom, the proposed method outperforms the existing denoising
      methods on preserving spatial resolution at the same level of noise suppression, 
      i.e., a reduction of noise standard deviation by one order of magnitude. This
      improvement is mainly attributed to the high noise correlation in the CT images
      reconstructed by the proposed algorithm. Iterative reconstruction using different
      regularization, including quadratic orq-generalized Gaussian Markov random field 
      regularization, achieves similar noise suppression from high noise correlation.
      However, the proposed TV regularization obtains a better edge preserving
      performance. Studies of electron density measurement also show that our method
      reduces the average estimation error from 9.5% to 7.1%. On the anthropomorphic
      head phantom, the proposed method suppresses the noise standard deviation of the 
      decomposed images by a factor of approximately 14 without blurring the fine
      structures in the sinus area. CONCLUSIONS: The authors propose a practical method
      for DECT imaging reconstruction, which combines the image reconstruction and
      material decomposition into one optimization framework. Compared to the existing 
      approaches, our method achieves a superior performance on DECT imaging with
      respect to decomposition accuracy, noise reduction, and spatial resolution.

TI  - Kinetic mechanism at the branchpoint between the DNA synthesis and editing
      pathways in individual DNA polymerase complexes.
PG  - 7117-31
LID - 10.1021/ja5026408 [doi]
AB  - Exonucleolytic editing of incorrectly incorporated nucleotides by replicative DNA
      polymerases (DNAPs) plays an essential role in the fidelity of DNA replication.
      Editing requires that the primer strand of the DNA substrate be transferred
      between the DNAP polymerase and exonuclease sites, separated by a distance that
      is typically on the order of ~30 A. Dynamic transitions between functional states
      can be quantified with single-nucleotide spatial precision and submillisecond
      temporal resolution from ionic current time traces recorded when individual DNAP 
      complexes are held atop a nanoscale pore in an electric field. In this study, we 
      have exploited this capability to determine the kinetic relationship between the 
      translocation step and primer strand transfer between the polymerase and
      exonuclease sites in complexes formed between the replicative DNAP from
      bacteriophage Phi29 and DNA. We demonstrate that the pathway for primer strand
      transfer from the polymerase to exonuclease site initiates prior to the
      translocation step, while complexes are in the pre-translocation state. We
      developed a mathematical method to determine simultaneously the forward and
      reverse translocation rates and the rates of primer strand transfer in both
      directions between the polymerase and the exonuclease sites, and we have applied 
      it to determine these rates for Phi29 DNAP complexes formed with a DNA substrate 
      bearing a fully complementary primer-template duplex. This work provides a
      framework that will be extended to determine the kinetic mechanisms by which
      incorporation of noncomplementary nucleotides promotes primer strand transfer
      from the polymerase site to the exonuclease site.

AB  - In the pursuit to develop enhanced technologies for cellular bioassays as well as
      understand single cell interactions with its underlying substrate, the field of
      biotechnology has extensively utilized lithographic techniques to spatially
      pattern proteins onto surfaces in user-defined geometries. Microcontact printing 
      (muCP) remains an incredibly useful patterning method due to its inexpensive
      nature, scalability, and the lack of considerable use of specialized clean room
      equipment. However, as new technologies emerge that necessitate various
      nano-sized areas of deposited proteins, traditional muCP methods may not be able 
      to supply users with the needed resolution size. Recently, our group developed a 
      modified "subtractive muCP" method which still retains many of the benefits
      offered by conventional muCP. Using this technique, we have been able to reach
      resolution sizes of fibronectin as small as 250 nm in largely spaced arrays for
      cell culture. In this communication, we present a detailed description of our
      subtractive muCP procedure that expands on many of the little tips and tricks
      that together make this procedure an easy and effective method for controlling
      protein patterning.

TI  - Wave optics theory and 3-D deconvolution for the light field microscope.
PG  - 25418-39
LID - 10.1364/OE.21.025418 [doi]
AB  - Light field microscopy is a new technique for high-speed volumetric imaging of
      weakly scattering or fluorescent specimens. It employs an array of microlenses to
      trade off spatial resolution against angular resolution, thereby allowing a 4-D
      light field to be captured using a single photographic exposure without the need 
      for scanning. The recorded light field can then be used to computationally
      reconstruct a full volume. In this paper, we present an optical model for light
      field microscopy based on wave optics, instead of previously reported ray optics 
      models. We also present a 3-D deconvolution method for light field microscopy
      that is able to reconstruct volumes at higher spatial resolution, and with better
      optical sectioning, than previously reported. To accomplish this, we take
      advantage of the dense spatio-angular sampling provided by a microlens array at
      axial positions away from the native object plane. This dense sampling permits us
      to decode aliasing present in the light field to reconstruct high-frequency
      information. We formulate our method as an inverse problem for reconstructing the
      3-D volume, which we solve using a GPU-accelerated iterative algorithm.
      Theoretical limits on the depth-dependent lateral resolution of the reconstructed
      volumes are derived. We show that these limits are in good agreement with
      experimental results on a standard USAF 1951 resolution target. Finally, we
      present 3-D reconstructions of pollen grains that demonstrate the improvements in
      fidelity made possible by our method.

AB  - By utilizing a reflective plasmonic slab, it is demonstrated numerically and
      experimentally in this paper deep sub-wavelength imaging lithography for nano
      characters with about 50 nm line width and dense lines with 32 nm half pitch
      resolution (about 1/12 wavelength). Compared with the control experiment without 
      reflective plasmonic slab, resolution and fidelity of imaged resist patterns are 
      remarkably improved especially for isolated nano features. Further numerical
      simulations show that near field optical proximity corrections help to improve
      imaging fidelity of two dimensional nano patterns.

TI  - Oil spill source identification by principal component analysis of electrospray
      ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectra.
PG  - 9064-9
LID - 10.1021/ac401604u [doi]
AB  - One fundamental challenge with either acute or chronic oil spills is to identify 
      the source, especially in highly polluted areas, near natural oil seeps, when the
      source contains more than one petroleum product or when extensive weathering has 
      occurred. Here we focus on heavy fuel oil that spilled (~200,000 L) from two
      suspected fuel tanks that were ruptured on the motor vessel (M/V) Cosco Busan
      when it struck the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in November 2007. We
      highlight the utility of principal component analysis (PCA) of elemental
      composition data obtained by high resolution FT-ICR mass spectrometry to
      correctly identify the source of environmental contamination caused by the
      unintended release of heavy fuel oil (HFO). Using ultrahigh resolution
      electrospray ionization (ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass
      spectrometry, we uniquely assigned thousands of elemental compositions of
      heteroatom-containing species in neat samples from both tanks and then applied
      principal component analysis. The components were based on double bond
      equivalents for constituents of elemental composition, CcHhN1S1. To determine if 
      the fidelity of our source identification was affected by weathering, field
      samples were collected at various intervals up to two years after the spill. We
      are able to identify a suite of polar petroleum markers that are environmentally 
      persistent, enabling us to confidently identify that only one tank was the source
      of the spilled oil: in fact, a single principal component could account for 98%
      of the variance. Although identification is unaffected by the presence of higher 
      polarity, petrogenic oxidation (weathering) products, future studies may require 
      removal of such species by anion exchange chromatography prior to mass spectral
      analysis due to their preferential ionization by ESI.

AB  - Human magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) are capable of tracking brain
      activity at millisecond temporal resolution in an entirely non-invasive manner, a
      feature that offers unique opportunities to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics
      of the hearing brain. In general, precise synchronisation of neural activity
      within as well as across distributed regions is likely to subserve any cognitive 
      process, with auditory cognition being no exception. Brain oscillations, in a
      range of frequencies, are a putative hallmark of this synchronisation process.
      Embedded in a larger effort to relate human cognition to brain oscillations, a
      field of research is emerging on how synchronisation within, as well as between, 
      brain regions may shape auditory cognition. Combined with much improved source
      localisation and connectivity techniques, it has become possible to study
      directly the neural activity of auditory cortex with unprecedented
      spatio-temporal fidelity and to uncover frequency-specific long-range
      connectivities across the human cerebral cortex. In the present review, we will
      summarise recent contributions mainly of our laboratories to this emerging
      domain. We present (1) a more general introduction on how to study local as well 
      as interareal synchronisation in human M/EEG; (2) how these networks may subserve
      and influence illusory auditory perception (clinical and non-clinical) and (3)
      auditory selective attention; and (4) how oscillatory networks further reflect
      and impact on speech comprehension. This article is part of a Special Issue
      entitled Human Auditory Neuroimaging.

TI  - High-fidelity national carbon mapping for resource management and REDD+.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/1750-0680-8-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High fidelity carbon mapping has the potential to greatly advance
      national resource management and to encourage international action toward climate
      change mitigation. However, carbon inventories based on field plots alone cannot 
      capture the heterogeneity of carbon stocks, and thus remote sensing-assisted
      approaches are critically important to carbon mapping at regional to global
      scales. We advanced a high-resolution, national-scale carbon mapping approach
      applied to the Republic of Panama - one of the first UN REDD + partner countries.
      RESULTS: Integrating measurements of vegetation structure collected by airborne
      Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with field inventory plots, we report
      LiDAR-estimated aboveground carbon stock errors of ~10% on any 1-ha land parcel
      across a wide range of ecological conditions. Critically, this shows that LiDAR
      provides a highly reliable replacement for inventory plots in areas lacking field
      data, both in humid tropical forests and among drier tropical vegetation types.
      We then scale up a systematically aligned LiDAR sampling of Panama using
      satellite data on topography, rainfall, and vegetation cover to model carbon
      stocks at 1-ha resolution with estimated average pixel-level uncertainty of 20.5 
      Mg C ha-1 nationwide. CONCLUSIONS: The national carbon map revealed strong
      abiotic and human controls over Panamanian carbon stocks, and the new level of
      detail with estimated uncertainties for every individual hectare in the country
      sets Panama at the forefront in high-resolution ecosystem management. With this
      repeatable approach, carbon resource decision-making can be made on a
      geospatially explicit basis, enhancing human welfare and environmental
      protection.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0058030 [doi]
AB  - Micro/nanoparticle induced near-field laser ultra-focusing and heating has been
      widely used in laser-assisted nanopatterning and nanolithography to pattern
      nanoscale features on a large-area substrate. Knowledge of the temperature and
      stress in the nanoscale near-field heating region is critical for process control
      and optimization. At present, probing of the nanoscale temperature, stress, and
      optical fields remains a great challenge since the heating area is very small
      (~100 nm or less) and not immediately accessible for sensing. In this work, we
      report the first experimental study on nanoscale mapping of particle-induced
      thermal, stress, and optical fields by using a single laser for both near-field
      excitation and Raman probing. The mapping results based on Raman intensity
      variation, wavenumber shift, and linewidth broadening all give consistent
      conjugated thermal, stress, and near-field focusing effects at a 20 nm resolution
      (<lambda/26, lambda = 32 nm). Nanoscale mapping of near-field effects of
      particles from 1210 down to 160 nm demonstrates the strong capacity of such a
      technique. By developing a new strategy for physical analysis, we have
      de-conjugated the effects of temperature, stress, and near-field focusing from
      the Raman mapping. The temperature rise and stress in the nanoscale heating
      region is evaluated at different energy levels. High-fidelity electromagnetic and
      temperature field simulation is conducted to accurately interpret the
      experimental results.

AB  - High-field gradient-echo (GE) BOLD fMRI enables very high resolution imaging, and
      has great potential for detailed investigations of brain function. However, as
      spatial resolution increases, confounds due to signal from non-capillary vessels 
      increasingly impact the fidelity of GE BOLD fMRI signals. Here we report on an
      assessment of the microvascular weighting of the GE BOLD response across the
      cortical depth in human cortex using spin-echo fMRI which is thought to be
      dominated by microvasculature (albeit not completely). BOLD responses were
      measured with a hemodynamic impulse response (HRF) obtained from the spin-echo
      (SE) and gradient-echo (GE) BOLD contrast using very short stimuli (0.25 s) and a
      fast event-related functional paradigm. We show that the onset ( approximately
      1.25 s) and the rising slope of the GE and SE HRFs are strikingly similar for
      voxels in deep gray matter presumably containing the most metabolically demanding
      neurons (layers III-IV). This finding provides a strong indication that the onset
      of the GE HRF in deep gray matter is predominantly associated with
      microvasculature.

TI  - High resolution UV roll-to-roll nanoimprinting of resin moulds and subsequent
      replication via thermal nanoimprint lithography.
PG  - 485310

AB  - UV roll-to-roll nanoimprinting at high resolution is still a relatively
      unexplored field of study with far-reaching application potential. One enabling
      technology that is particularly worthy of attention is mass production of high
      resolution resin moulds via UV roll-to-roll nanoimprinting at such high
      throughput and low cost that they can be used only once and disposed of or
      recycled economically. Low cost, high resolution resin moulds can greatly improve
      the production cost profile for a number of applications in biomedicine,
      nanofluidics, data storage and electronics with relatively low unit values but
      which require one or more nanoscale lithography steps. In this report, UV
      roll-to-roll nanoimprinting was employed to fabricate high fidelity resin moulds 
      with nanoscale as well as mixed micro- and nanoscale features down to 50 nm
      feature diameter, at up to 120 cm(2) area and at 10 m min(-1) throughput. UV
      roll-to-roll nanoimprinted resin moulds were subsequently segmented out, employed
      in a batch mode thermal nanoimprinting process, and characterized to study
      performance and demonstrate viability. The results show that high resolution
      mixed nanostructures can be faithfully replicated in PMMA on silicon substrates
      with minimal volumetric shrinkage. Process details and challenges specific to
      roll-to-roll fabrication of resin moulds are discussed at length, particularly
      with respect to the curvature uniformity of the imprint roller.

PG  - 14152-67
LID - 10.1364/OE.20.014152 [doi]
AB  - This work reports on the first time experimental investigation of temperature
      field inside silicon substrates under particle-induced near-field focusing at a
      sub-wavelength resolution. The noncontact Raman thermometry technique employing
      both Raman shift and full width at half maximum (FWHM) methods is employed to
      investigate the temperature rise in silicon beneath silica particles. Silica
      particles of three diameters (400, 800 and 1210 nm), each under four laser energy
      fluxes of 2.5 x 10(8), 3.8 x10(8), 6.9 x10(8) and 8.6 x10(8) W/m(2), are used to 
      investigate the effects of particle size and laser energy flux. The experimental 
      results indicate that as the particle size or the laser energy flux increases,
      the temperature rise inside the substrate goes higher. Maximum temperature rises 
      of 55.8 K (based on Raman FWHM method) and 29.3K (based on Raman shift method)
      are observed inside the silicon under particles of 1210 nm diameter with an
      incident laser of 8.6 x 10(8) W/m(2). The difference is largely due to the stress
      inside the silicon caused by the laser heating. To explore the mechanism of
      heating at the sub-wavelength scale, high-fidelity simulations are conducted on
      the enhanced electric and temperature fields. Modeling results agree with
      experiment qualitatively, and discussions are provided about the reasons for
      their discrepancy.

TI  - Partial Fourier transform reconstruction for single-shot MRI with linear
      frequency-swept excitation.
PG  - 1326-36
LID - 10.1002/mrm.24366 [doi]
AB  - A novel image encoding approach based on linear frequency-swept excitation has
      been recently proposed to overcome artifacts induced by various field
      perturbations in single-shot echo planar imaging. In this article, we develop a
      new super-resolved reconstruction method for it using the concepts of local
      k-space and partial Fourier transform. This method is superior to the originally 
      developed conjugate gradient algorithm in convenience, image quality, and
      stability of solution. Reduced field-of-view is applied to the phase encoding
      direction to further enhance the spatial resolution and field perturbation
      immunity of the image obtained. Effectiveness of this new combined reconstruction
      method is demonstrated with a series of experiments on biological samples. Two
      single-shot sequences with different encoding features are tested. The results
      show that this reconstruction method maintains excellent field perturbation
      immunity and improves fidelity of the images. In vivo experiments on rat indicate
      that this solution is favorable for ultrafast imaging applications in which
      severe susceptibility heterogeneities around the tissue-air or tissue-bone
      interfaces, motion and oblique plane effects usually compromise the echo planar
      imaging image quality.

TI  - Ultra-high resolution diffusion tensor imaging of the microscopic pathways of the
      medial temporal lobe.
PG  - 2065-82
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.05.065 [doi]
AB  - Diseases involving the medial temporal lobes (MTL) such as Alzheimer's disease
      and mesial temporal sclerosis pose an ongoing diagnostic challenge because of the
      difficulty in identifying conclusive imaging features, particularly in
      pre-clinical states. Abnormal neuronal connectivity may be present in the
      circuitry of the MTL, but current techniques cannot reliably detect those
      abnormalities. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown promise in defining
      putative abnormalities in connectivity, but DTI studies of the MTL performed to
      date have shown neither dramatic nor consistent differences across patient
      populations. Conventional DTI methodology provides an inadequate depiction of the
      complex microanatomy present in the medial temporal lobe because of a typically
      employed low isotropic resolution of 2.0-2.5 mm, a low signal-to-noise ratio
      (SNR), and echo-planar imaging (EPI) geometric distortions that are exacerbated
      by the inhomogeneous magnetic environment at the skull base. In this study, we
      pushed the resolving power of DTI to near-mm isotropic voxel size to achieve a
      detailed depiction of mesial temporal microstructure at 3 T. High image fidelity 
      and SNR at this resolution are achieved through several mechanisms: (1) acquiring
      multiple repetitions of the minimum field of view required for hippocampal
      coverage to boost SNR; (2) utilizing a single-refocused diffusion preparation to 
      enhance SNR further; (3) performing a phase correction to reduce Rician noise;
      (4) minimizing distortion and maintaining left-right distortion symmetry with
      axial-plane parallel imaging; and (5) retaining anatomical and quantitative
      accuracy through the use of motion correction coupled with a higher-order
      eddy-current correction scheme. We combined this high-resolution methodology with
      a detailed segmentation of the MTL to identify tracks in all subjects that may
      represent the major pathways of the MTL, including the perforant pathway.
      Tractography performed on a subset of the data identified similar tracks,
      although they were lesser in number. This detailed analysis of MTL substructure
      may have applications to clinical populations.

TI  - Parallel-transmission-enabled magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo
      T1-weighted imaging of the human brain at 7 T.
PG  - 2140-50
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.05.068 [doi]
AB  - One of the promises of Ultra High Field (UHF) MRI scanners is to bring finer
      spatial resolution in the human brain images due to an increased signal to noise 
      ratio. However, at such field strengths, the spatial non-uniformity of the Radio 
      Frequency (RF) transmit profiles challenges the applicability of most MRI
      sequences, where the signal and contrast levels strongly depend on the flip angle
      (FA) homogeneity. In particular, the MP-RAGE sequence, one of the most commonly
      employed 3D sequences to obtain T1-weighted anatomical images of the brain, is
      highly sensitive to these spatial variations. These cause deterioration in image 
      quality and complicate subsequent image post-processing such as automated tissue 
      segmentation at UHF. In this work, we evaluate the potential of
      parallel-transmission (pTx) to obtain high-quality MP-RAGE images of the human
      brain at 7 T. To this end, non-selective transmit-SENSE pulses were individually 
      tailored for each of 8 subjects under study, and applied to an 8-channel
      transmit-array. Such RF pulses were designed both for the low-FA excitation train
      and the 180 degrees inversion preparation involved in the sequence, both
      utilizing the recently introduced k(T)-point trajectory. The resulting images
      were compared with those obtained from the conventional method and from
      subject-specific RF-shimmed excitations. In addition, four of the volunteers were
      scanned at 3 T for benchmarking purposes (clinical setup without pTx).
      Subsequently, automated tissue classification was performed to provide a more
      quantitative measure of the final image quality. Results indicated that pTx could
      already significantly improve image quality at 7 T by adopting a suitable
      RF-Shim. Exploiting the full potential of the pTx-setup, the proposed k(T)-point 
      method provided excellent inversion fidelity, comparable to what is commonly only
      achievable at 3 T with energy intensive adiabatic pulses. Furthermore, the
      cumulative energy deposition was simultaneously reduced by over 40% compared to
      the conventional adiabatic inversions. Regarding the low-FA k(T)-point based
      excitations, the FA uniformity achieved at 7 T surpassed what is typically
      obtained at 3 T. Subsequently, automated white and gray matter segmentation not
      only confirmed the expected improvements in image quality, but also suggests that
      care should be taken to properly account for the strong local susceptibility
      effects near cranial cavities. Overall, these findings indicate that the
      k(T)-point-based pTx solution is an excellent candidate for UHF 3D imaging, where
      patient safety is a major concern due to the increase of specific absorption
      rates.

      this technique to a unit cell from a silicon CMOS-compatible photonic lattice
      filter that has a rapidly changing transfer function with an 8.33 ns update time,
      120 MHz spectral resolution, and 12 GHz bandwidth. These dynamic measurements
      allow characterization of transients, thermal effects, filter fidelity, and other
      time-dependent phenomena during switching.

      plants and the atmosphere. Ca(2+)-dependent and Ca(2+)-independent mechanisms
      function in these responses. Key stomatal regulation mechanisms, including plasma
      membrane and vacuolar ion channels have been identified and are regulated by the 
      free cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt)). SCOPE: Here we show that
      CO(2)-induced stomatal closing is strongly impaired under conditions that prevent
      intracellular Ca(2+) elevations. Moreover, Ca(2+) oscillation-induced stomatal
      closing is partially impaired in knock-out mutations in several guard
      cell-expressed Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) here, including the
      cpk4cpk11 double and cpk10 mutants; however, abscisic acid-regulated stomatal
      movements remain relatively intact in the cpk4cpk11 and cpk10 mutants. We further
      discuss diverse studies of Ca(2+) signalling in guard cells, discuss apparent
      peculiarities, and pose novel open questions. The recently proposed Ca(2+)
      sensitivity priming model could account for many of the findings in the field.
      Recent research shows that the stomatal closing stimuli abscisic acid and CO(2)
      enhance the sensitivity of stomatal closing mechanisms to intracellular Ca(2+),
      which has been termed 'calcium sensitivity priming'. The genome of the reference 
      plant Arabidopsis thaliana encodes for over 250 Ca(2+)-sensing proteins, giving
      rise to the question, how can specificity in Ca(2+) responses be achieved?
      Calcium sensitivity priming could provide a key mechanism contributing to
      specificity in eukaryotic Ca(2+) signal transduction, a topic of central interest
      in cell signalling research. In this article we further propose an individual
      stomatal tracking method for improved analyses of stimulus-regulated stomatal
      movements in Arabidopsis guard cells that reduces noise and increases fidelity in
      stimulus-regulated stomatal aperture responses ( Box 1). This method is
      recommended for stomatal response research, in parallel to previously adopted
      blind analyses, due to the relatively small and diverse sizes of stomatal
      apertures in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

TI  - High temporal resolution decoding of object position and category.
LID - 10.1167/11.10.9 [doi]
LID - 9 [pii]
AB  - We effortlessly and seemingly instantaneously recognize thousands of objects,
      although we rarely--if ever--see the same image of an object twice. The retinal
      image of an object can vary by context, size, viewpoint, illumination, and
      location. The present study examined how the visual system abstracts object
      category across variations in retinal location. In three experiments,
      participants viewed images of objects presented to different retinal locations
      while brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). A pattern
      classifier was trained to recover the stimulus position (Experiments 1, 2, and 3)
      and category (Experiment 3) from the recordings. Using this decoding approach, we
      show that an object's location in the visual field can be recovered in high
      temporal resolution (5 ms) and with sufficient fidelity to capture topographic
      organization in visual areas. Experiment 3 showed that an object's category could
      be recovered from the recordings as early as 135 ms after the onset of the
      stimulus and that category decoding generalized across retinal location (i.e.,
      position invariance). Our experiments thus show that the visual system rapidly
      constructs a category representation for objects that is invariant to position.

TI  - Theoretical studies of the base pair fidelity of selenium-modified DNA.
PG  - 10041-8
LID - 10.1021/jp204204x [doi]
AB  - The introduction of selenium into DNA in the place of oxygen provides a unique
      opportunity for studying the fidelity of DNA replication, as well as providing
      advantages in the growth of DNA crystals and the greater resolution of their
      structures. However, the atomic mechanisms of the relative stability and base
      pair recognition of the selenium-modified DNA are poorly understood. In the
      present study, quantum mechanics calculations were performed on base pairings,
      base stacking, and base-water interactions for both unmodified thymine and
      thymine with the 2-exo-oxygen replaced with selenium, and the results were used
      to develop and validate CHARMM force field parameters for the 2-Se-thymine.
      Subsequently, molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy perturbation
      calculations were performed on 11-base DNA sequences containing native thymine
      and the 2-Se-thymine. The calculated relative free-energy values are in good
      agreement with experimentally determined relative stability, where the
      2-Se-thymine offers similar stability to T-A in cognate DNA, while it
      dramatically destabilizes the DNA containing the T-G mismatch base pair when
      2-Se-thymine is incorporated. Thus, 2-Se-thymine largely increases the native T-A
      base pair fidelity by discouraging the T-G wobble pair. Insights into the high
      pairing specificity and the relative stability of selenium-modified DNA were
      obtained based on detailed structural and energetic analysis of molecular
      dynamics trajectories. Our studies move one step further toward an understanding 
      of the high base pair fidelity and thermodynamic properties of Se-DNA in solution
      and in protein-DNA complexes.

TI  - Ultra-high-field MRI real-time imaging of HSC engraftment of the bone marrow
      niche.
PG  - 1223-31
LID - 10.1038/leu.2011.72 [doi]
AB  - The bone marrow (BM) undergoes extensive remodeling following irradiation damage.
      A crucial part of restoring homeostasis following irradiation is the ability of
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to home to and engraft specialized niches within 
      the BM through a remodeling BM vascular system. Here we show that a combination
      of ultra-high-field strength magnetic resonance imaging (17.6 T, MRI) coupled
      with fluorescent microscopy (FLM) serves as a powerful tool for the in vivo
      imaging of cell homing within the BM. Ultra-high-field MRI can achieve
      high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) images (28 x 28 x 60 mum(3)) of the BM in 
      live mice, sufficient to resolve anatomical changes in BM microstructures
      attributed to radiation damage. Following intra-arterial infusion with
      dsRed-expressing BM cells, labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxides, both FLM
      and MRI could be used to follow initial homing and engraftment of donor HSC to a 
      limited number of preferred sites within a few cell diameters of the calcified
      bone-the endosteal niche. Subsequent histology confirmed the fidelity and
      accuracy of MRI to create non-invasive, high-resolution 3D images of donor cell
      engraftment of the BM in living animals at the level of single-cell detection.

TI  - Development and clinical evaluation of a three-dimensional cone-beam computed
      tomography estimation method using a deformation field map.
PG  - 1584-93
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.02.002 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a three-dimensional (3D) cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)
      estimation method using a deformation field map, and to evaluate and optimize the
      efficiency and accuracy of the method for use in the clinical setting. METHODS
      AND MATERIALS: We propose a method to estimate patient CBCT images using prior
      information and a deformation model. Patients' previous CBCT data are used as the
      prior information, and the new CBCT volume to be estimated is considered as a
      deformation of the prior image volume. The deformation field map is solved by
      minimizing deformation energy and maintaining new projection data fidelity using 
      a nonlinear conjugate gradient method. This method was implemented in 3D form
      using hardware acceleration and multi-resolution scheme, and it was evaluated for
      different scan angles, projection numbers, and scan directions using liver, lung,
      and prostate cancer patient data. The accuracy of the estimation was evaluated by
      comparing the organ volume difference and the similarity between estimated CBCT
      and the CBCT reconstructed from fully sampled projections. RESULTS: Results
      showed that scan direction and number of projections do not have significant
      effects on the CBCT estimation accuracy. The total scan angle is the dominant
      factor affecting the accuracy of the CBCT estimation algorithm. Larger scan
      angles yield better estimation accuracy than smaller scan angles. Lung cancer
      patient data showed that the estimation error of the 3D lung tumor volume was
      reduced from 13.3% to 4.3% when the scan angle was increased from 60 degrees to
      360 degrees using 57 projections. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed estimation method is 
      applicable for 3D DTS, 3D CBCT, four-dimensional CBCT, and four-dimensional DTS
      image estimation. This method has the potential for significantly reducing the
      imaging dose and improving the image quality by removing the organ distortion
      artifacts and streak artifacts shown in images reconstructed by the conventional 
      Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm.

TI  - Data-driven optimization and evaluation of 2D EPI and 3D PRESTO for BOLD fMRI at 
      7 Tesla: I. Focal coverage.
PG  - 1034-43
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.12.086 [doi]
AB  - Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) is commonly performed using 2D single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI).
      However, single-shot EPI at 7 Tesla (T) often suffers from significant geometric 
      distortions (due to low bandwidth (BW) in the phase-encode (PE) direction) and
      amplified physiological noise. Recent studies have suggested that 3D multi-shot
      sequences such as PRESTO may offer comparable BOLD contrast-to-noise ratio with
      increased volume coverage and decreased geometric distortions. Thus, a four-way
      group-level comparison was performed between 2D and 3D acquisition sequences at
      two in-plane resolutions. The quality of fMRI data was evaluated via metrics of
      prediction and reproducibility using NPAIRS (Non-parametric Prediction,
      Activation, Influence and Reproducibility re-Sampling). Group activation maps
      were optimized for each acquisition strategy by selecting the number of principal
      components that jointly maximized prediction and reproducibility, and showed good
      agreement in sensitivity and specificity for positive BOLD changes.
      High-resolution EPI exhibited the highest z-scores of the four acquisition
      sequences; however, it suffered from the lowest BW in the PE direction (resulting
      in the worst geometric distortions) and limited spatial coverage, and also caused
      some subject discomfort through peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS). In
      comparison, PRESTO also had high z-scores (higher than EPI for a matched in-plane
      resolution), the highest BW in the PE direction (producing images with superior
      geometric fidelity), the potential for whole-brain coverage, and no reported PNS.
      This study provides evidence to support the use of 3D multi-shot acquisition
      sequences in lieu of single-shot EPI for ultra high field BOLD fMRI at 7T.

      stimuli. The potential for surface micro-electrodes closely spaced together to
      provide even higher fidelity in recording surface field potentials has been a
      topic of recent interest in the neural prosthetic community. This study describes
      the classification of spoken words from surface local field potentials (LFPs)
      recorded using grids of subdural, nonpenetrating high impedance micro-electrodes.
      Data recorded from these micro-ECoG electrodes supported accurate and rapid
      classification. Furthermore, electrodes spaced millimeters apart demonstrated
      varying classification characteristics, suggesting that cortical surface LFPs may
      be recorded with high temporal and spatial resolution to enable even more robust 
      algorithms for motor classification.

TI  - A digital lock-in upgrade of the motional Stark effect diagnostic on DIII-D.
PG  - 10D739
LID - 10.1063/1.3496989 [doi]
AB  - The use of lock-in amplifiers for phase sensitive detection of motional Stark
      effect (MSE) diagnostic signals is of critical importance to real-time internal
      current profile measurements in tokamak plasmas. A digital lock-in (DLI) upgrade 
      utilizing field programable gate array firmware has been installed on the MSE
      system of the DIII-D tokamak for the eventual replacement of largely obsolete
      analog units. While the new digital system has shown a small reduction in
      electronic noise over the analog, the main advantages are reduced cost, hardware 
      simplicity, compact size, and phase tracking during plasma operations. DLI
      recovery of MSE polarization angles was accomplished through use of reference
      processing to produce only photoelastic modulator (PEM) second harmonic
      frequencies and electronic signal processing to maximize the fidelity of the
      recovered signal. A simplified discrete analytical solution was found that
      accurately describes the new DLI hardware. The DLI algorithm was found to cause a
      prohibitively large oscillating artifact atop the demodulated signal. The
      artifact was caused by the accumulator interval not containing an exact integer
      number of PEM multiplier periods. Successful MSE measurements require the
      minimization of this oscillating artifact amplitude. The analytical solution was 
      used to select an appropriate accumulator interval that both reduces the artifact
      and maintains the greatest temporal resolution possible. Sample EFIT equilibria
      reconstructions and corresponding safety factor profiles showed very close
      agreement between the analog and digital lock-ins.

AB  - We describe the development of both multilevel two-dimensional and grid-based
      three-dimensional illumination systems for volumetric particle image velocimetry 
      (PIV) that uses a single camera and an arbitrary number of low powered lasers.
      This flexible system is robust and capable of capturing results over a range of
      spatiotemporal scales determined by the choice of camera, the depth of field of
      the lens, and the laser power. The system is demonstrated on a rotating spin-up
      experiment where we extract high fidelity velocity fields at up to 62 frames/s at
      a spatial resolution of 2352x1728 pixels. The flexibility and economy offered by 
      this system--approximately one-tenth that of a comparable commercial package--may
      make it attractive to many laboratory users.

TI  - Slowing the translocation of double-stranded DNA using a nanopore smaller than
      the double helix.
PG  - 395501
LID - 10.1088/0957-4484/21/39/395501 [doi]
AB  - It is now possible to slow and trap a single molecule of double-stranded DNA
      (dsDNA), by stretching it using a nanopore, smaller in diameter than the double
      helix, in a solid-state membrane. By applying an electric force larger than the
      threshold for stretching, dsDNA can be impelled through the pore. Once a current 
      blockade associated with a translocating molecule is detected, the electric field
      in the pore is switched in an interval less than the translocation time to a
      value below the threshold for stretching. According to molecular dynamics (MD)
      simulations, this leaves the dsDNA stretched in the pore constriction with the
      base-pairs tilted, while the B-form canonical structure is preserved outside the 
      pore. In this configuration, the translocation velocity is substantially reduced 
      from 1 bp/10 ns to approximately 1 bp/2 ms in the extreme, potentially
      facilitating high fidelity reads for sequencing, precise sorting, and high
      resolution (force) spectroscopy.

TI  - Single-atom-resolved fluorescence imaging of an atomic Mott insulator.
PG  - 68-72
LID - 10.1038/nature09378 [doi]
AB  - The reliable detection of single quantum particles has revolutionized the field
      of quantum optics and quantum information processing. For several years,
      researchers have aspired to extend such detection possibilities to larger-scale, 
      strongly correlated quantum systems in order to record in situ images of a
      quantum fluid in which each underlying quantum particle is detected. Here we
      report fluorescence imaging of strongly interacting bosonic Mott insulators in an
      optical lattice with single-atom and single-site resolution. From our images, we 
      fully reconstruct the atom distribution on the lattice and identify individual
      excitations with high fidelity. A comparison of the radial density and variance
      distributions with theory provides a precise in situ temperature and entropy
      measurement from single images. We observe Mott-insulating plateaus with
      near-zero entropy and clearly resolve the high-entropy rings separating them,
      even though their width is of the order of just a single lattice site.
      Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts with increasing temperature,
      owing to a proliferation of local defects. The ability to resolve individual
      lattice sites directly opens up new avenues for the manipulation, analysis and
      applications of strongly interacting quantum gases on a lattice. For example, one
      could introduce local perturbations or access regions of high entropy, a crucial 
      requirement for the implementation of novel cooling schemes.

TI  - Validation of high-resolution echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging vs.
      high-fidelity catheterization in experimental pulmonary hypertension.
PG  - L401-12
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00114.2010 [doi]
AB  - High-frequency echocardiography and high-field-strength magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) are new noninvasive methods for quantifying pulmonary arterial
      hypertension (PAH) and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy (RVH). We compared
      these noninvasive methods of assessing the pulmonary circulation to the gold
      standard, cardiac catheterization (micromanometer-tipped catheters), in rats with
      monocrotaline-induced PAH and normal controls. Closed-chest, Sprague-Dawley rats 
      were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane (25 monocrotaline, 6 age-matched
      controls). Noninvasive studies used 37.5-MHz ultrasound (Vevo 770; VisualSonics) 
      or a 9.4-T MRI (Bruker BioSpin). Catheterization used a 1.4-F
      micromanometer-tipped Millar catheter and a thermodilution catheter to measure
      cardiac output (CO). We compared noninvasive measures of pulmonary artery (PA)
      pressure (PAP) using PA acceleration time (PAAT) and CO, using the geometric PA
      flow method and RV free wall (RVFW) thickness/mass with cardiac catheterization
      and/or autopsy. Blinded operators performed comparisons using each method within 
      2 days of another. In a subset of rats with monocrotaline PAH, weekly
      echocardiograms, catheterization, and autopsy data assessed disease progression. 
      Heart rate was similar during all studies (>323 beats/min). PAAT shortened, and
      the PA flow envelope displayed systolic "notching," reflective of downstream
      vascular remodeling/stiffening, within 3 wk of monocrotaline. MRI and
      echocardiography measures of PAAT were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.87) and were
      inversely proportional to invasive mean PAP (r(2) = 0.72). Mean PAP by
      echocardiography was estimated as 58.7 - (1.21 x PAAT). Invasive and noninvasive 
      CO measurement correlated well (r(2) >or= 0.75). Noninvasive measures of RVFW
      thickness/mass correlated well with postmortem measurements. We conclude that
      high-resolution echocardiography and MRI accurately determine CO, PAP, and RV
      thickness/mass, offering similar results as high-fidelity right heart
      catheterization and autopsy, and that PAAT accurately estimates PAP and permits
      serial monitoring of experimental PAH. These tools are useful for assessment of
      the rodent pulmonary circulation and RVH.

TI  - Mirror lenses in light microscopy--theoretical considerations and practical
      implications.
PG  - 681-93
LID - 10.1002/jemt.20809 [doi]
AB  - Various types of mirror lenses were developed some decades ago designed for
      several special tasks in microscopy. When compared with high-end glass lenses,
      mirror lenses lead to an extraordinary image quality because of their
      supraapochromatic color fidelity and their high planarity; the working distances 
      are significantly longer, and in most cases, the depth of field and resolution
      are higher than in concurrent glass lenses. In this respect, the microscopic
      advantages of mirror lenses seem to be comparable with the advantages of mirror
      telescopes in astronomy; for in observations of celestial bodies, mirror
      telescopes lead to better results than refractors based on glass lenses. When
      mirror lenses are available in light microscopy, not only common illumination
      modes can be carried out in transmitted or incident light, but also new and
      specific axial illumination techniques can be utilized, which cannot be achieved 
      with normal glass lenses. This axial illumination, called "luminance contrast,"
      can be carried out in various modes, so that the resulting images can be compared
      with dark-field, phase or interference-contrast images. In all variants,
      especially, fine details within transparent specimens can be visible in maximized
      contrast and resolution, and blooming or haloing artifacts are significantly
      reduced or absent. These findings are based on theoretical consideration, and
      intensive practical tests carried out with several mirror lenses constructed in
      various optical designs. All in all, supramicroscopic image qualities could be
      expected if mirror lenses were produced based on the optimized manufacturing
      techniques available nowadays.

PG  - 12948-56
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2471-09.2009 [doi]
AB  - A fundamental organizational principle of the primate motor system is cortical
      control of contralateral limb movements. Motor areas also appear to play a role
      in the control of ipsilateral limb movements. Several studies in monkeys have
      shown that individual neurons in primary motor cortex (M1) may represent, on
      average, the direction of movements of the ipsilateral arm. Given the increasing 
      body of evidence demonstrating that neural ensembles can reliably represent
      information with a high temporal resolution, here we characterize the distributed
      neural representation of ipsilateral upper limb kinematics in both monkey and
      man. In two macaque monkeys trained to perform center-out reaching movements, we 
      found that the ensemble spiking activity in M1 could continuously represent
      ipsilateral limb position. Interestingly, this representation was more correlated
      with joint angles than hand position. Using bilateral electromyography
      recordings, we excluded the possibility that postural or mirror movements could
      exclusively account for these findings. In addition, linear methods could decode 
      limb position from cortical field potentials in both monkeys. We also found that 
      M1 spiking activity could control a biomimetic brain-machine interface reflecting
      ipsilateral kinematics. Finally, we recorded cortical field potentials from three
      human subjects and also consistently found evidence of a neural representation
      for ipsilateral movement parameters. Together, our results demonstrate the
      presence of a high-fidelity neural representation for ipsilateral movement and
      illustrates that it can be successfully incorporated into a brain-machine
      interface.

TI  - HARDI denoising: variational regularization of the spherical apparent diffusion
      coefficient sADC.
PG  - 515-27
AB  - We denoise HARDI (High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging) data arising in
      medical imaging. Diffusion imaging is a relatively new and powerful method to
      measure the 3D profile of water diffusion at each point. This can be used to
      reconstruct fiber directions and pathways in the living brain, providing detailed
      maps of fiber integrity and connectivity. HARDI is a powerful new extension of
      diffusion imaging, which goes beyond the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model:
      mathematically, intensity data is given at every voxel and at any direction on
      the sphere. However, HARDI data is usually highly contaminated with noise,
      depending on the b-value which is a tuning parameter preselected to collect the
      data. Larger b-values help to collect more accurate information in terms of
      measuring diffusivity, but more noise is generated by many factors as well. So
      large b-values are preferred, if we can satisfactorily reduce the noise without
      losing the data structure. We propose a variational method to denoise HARDI data 
      by denoising the spherical Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (sADC), a field of
      radial functions derived from the data. We use vectorial total variation
      regularization, an L1 data fidelity term and the logarithmic barrier function in 
      the minimization. We present experiments of denoising synthetic and real HARDI
      data.

TI  - Image analysis for denoising full-field frequency-domain fluorescence lifetime
      images.
PG  - 221-37
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03212.x [doi]
AB  - Video-rate fluorescence lifetime-resolved imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a
      quantitative imaging technique for measuring dynamic processes in biological
      specimens. FLIM offers valuable information in addition to simple fluorescence
      intensity imaging; for instance, the fluorescence lifetime is sensitive to the
      microenvironment of the fluorophore allowing reliable differentiation between
      concentration differences and dynamic quenching. Homodyne FLIM is a full-field
      frequency-domain technique for imaging fluorescence lifetimes at every pixel of a
      fluorescence image simultaneously. If a single modulation frequency is used,
      video-rate image acquisition is possible. Homodyne FLIM uses a gain-modulated
      image intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) detector, which unfortunately is a
      major contribution to the noise of the measurement. Here we introduce image
      analysis for denoising homodyne FLIM data. The denoising routine is fast,
      improves the extraction of the fluorescence lifetime value(s) and increases the
      sensitivity and fluorescence lifetime resolving power of the FLIM instrument. The
      spatial resolution (especially the high spatial frequencies not related to noise)
      of the FLIM image is preserved, because the denoising routine does not blur or
      smooth the image. By eliminating the random noise known to be specific to photon 
      noise and from the intensifier amplification, the fidelity of the spatial
      resolution is improved. The polar plot projection, a rapid FLIM analysis method, 
      is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the denoising routine with exemplary 
      data from both physical and complex biological samples. We also suggest broader
      impacts of the image analysis for other fluorescence microscopy techniques (e.g. 
      super-resolution imaging).

TI  - Advances in bioanalytical LC-MS using the Orbitrap mass analyzer.
PG  - 741-54
LID - 10.4155/bio.09.65 [doi]
AB  - The continuing desire to analyze complex biological samples with the minimum
      number of steps places high demands on increasing speed, dynamic signal range,
      quantitative capability and the facility with which the mass spectrometers can
      interface with chromatographic separation methods. Reliable identification of
      metabolites in complex mixtures requires robust mass spectrometers with high
      resolving power, mass accuracy, sensitivity and dynamic range, while tandem MS is
      an invaluable tool for further structural characterization. This review begins
      with a discussion of the key properties of the Orbitrap mass analyzer: mass
      accuracy, resolution, fidelity of isotope pattern abundancies and dynamic range. 
      The main objective is to provide an overview of Orbitrap applications in the
      field of bioanalysis. Specific areas of drug metabolism, doping control and food 
      contaminants are discussed in detail illustrating the performance and versatility
      of the Orbitrap mass analyzer.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of stereotactic target localization using 3-Tesla MRI for
      radiosurgery planning.
PG  - 1472-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.03.020 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Increasing the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) field strength can
      improve image resolution and quality, but concerns remain regarding the influence
      on geometric fidelity. The objectives of the present study were to spatially
      investigate the effect of 3-Tesla (3T) MRI on clinical target localization for
      stereotactic radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 39 patients were
      enrolled in a research ethics board-approved prospective clinical trial. Imaging 
      (1.5T and 3T MRI and computed tomography) was performed after stereotactic frame 
      placement. Stereotactic target localization at 1.5T vs. 3T was retrospectively
      analyzed in a representative cohort of patients with tumor (n = 4) and functional
      (n = 5) radiosurgical targets. The spatial congruency of the tumor gross target
      volumes was determined by the mean discrepancy between the average gross target
      volume surfaces at 1.5T and 3T. Reproducibility was assessed by the displacement 
      from an averaged surface and volume congruency. Spatial congruency and the
      reproducibility of functional radiosurgical targets was determined by comparing
      the mean and standard deviation of the isocenter coordinates. RESULTS: Overall,
      the mean absolute discrepancy across all patients was 0.67 mm (95% confidence
      interval, 0.51-0.83), significantly <1 mm (p < .010). No differences were found
      in the overall interuser target volume congruence (mean, 84% for 1.5T vs. 84% for
      3T, p > .4), and the gross target volume surface mean displacements were similar 
      within and between users. The overall average isocenter coordinate discrepancy
      for the functional targets at 1.5T and 3T was 0.33 mm (95% confidence interval,
      0.20-0.48), with no patient-specific differences between the mean values (p >.2) 
      or standard deviations (p >.1). CONCLUSION: Our results have provided clinically 
      relevant evidence supporting the spatial validity of 3T MRI for use in
      stereotactic radiosurgery under the imaging conditions used.

TI  - Electrophoretic chip for fractionation of selective DNA fragment.
PG  - 3959-63
LID - 10.1002/elps.200700904 [doi]
AB  - A microchannel chip has been used to fractionate selected segments from an
      electrophoretic flow of separated fragments. A sample, which covers the size from
      35 to 670 bp, was initially separated using an 8.8-cm-long channel at the
      electric field strength of 100 V/cm. The target fragment of 318 bp was selected
      and extracted from the separation channel. High-resolution fractionation was
      achieved by introducing new procedures for blocking, extraction, and segment
      transfer. Fractionation quality with and without blocking were compared using a
      310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The results show that no contamination
      was found in the sample, which was fractionated with blocking; however, a
      contamination by short segments was found in the sample, which was fractionated
      without blocking. Furthermore, fractionation by the chip was found to be of
      higher fidelity than that by the polyacrylamide slab gel, which displayed a small
      overlapped peak after the target peak. Compared with the traditional method, our 
      chips enable faster and high-fidelity fractionation, thus providing a new tool
      for bioanalysis and other applications.

TI  - High-fidelity numerical realization of multiple-step Fresnel propagation for the 
      reconstruction of digital holograms.
PG  - D12-20
AB  - A cascaded Fresnel algorithm for the flexible reconstruction of digital holograms
      is proposed. Since the fast-Fourier-transform-based numerical realization of the 
      Fresnel integral shows a dependency of its pixel resolution and its computation
      window size on the propagation distance different from that of the corresponding 
      physical system, the computation window can be smaller than the actual physical
      diffraction field in the intermediate plane. Consequently, distortions in the
      final reconstruction may occur. A method is proposed to eliminate such
      distortion. The validity of this method is shown by both numerical simulations
      and experimental results.

LID - 10.1016/j.jmr.2008.04.037 [doi]
AB  - Microfluidics has advanced to become a complete lab-on-a-chip platform with
      applications across many disciplines of scientific research. While optical
      techniques are primarily used as modes of detection, magnetic resonance (MR) is
      emerging as a potentially powerful and complementary tool because of its
      non-invasive operation and analytical fidelity. Two prevailing limitations
      currently inhibit MR techniques on microfluidic devices: poor sensitivity and the
      relatively slow time scale of dynamics that can be probed. It is commonly assumed
      that the time scale of observation of one variable limits the certainty with
      which one can measure the complementary variable. For example, short observation 
      times imply poor spectral resolution. In this article, we demonstrate a new
      methodology that overcomes this fundamental limit, allowing in principle for
      arbitrarily high temporal resolution with a sensitivity across the entire
      microfluidic device several orders of magnitude greater than is possible by
      direct MR measurement. The enhancement is evidenced by recording chemically
      resolved fluid mixing through a complex 3D microfluidic device at 500 frames per 
      second, the highest recorded in a magnetic resonance imaging experiment. The key 
      to this development is combining remote detection with a time 'slicing' of its
      spatially encoded counterpart. Remote detection circumvents the problem of
      insensitive direct MR detection on a microfluidic device where the direct
      sensitivity is less than 10(-5) relative to traditional NMR, while the time
      slicing eliminates the constraints of the limited observation time by converting 
      the time variable into a spatial variable through the use of magnetic field
      gradients. This method has implications for observing fast processes, such as
      fluid mixing, rapid binding, and certain classes of chemical reactions with sub
      millisecond time resolution and as a new modality for on-chip chromatography.

LID - 10.1186/1532-429X-10-29 [doi]
AB  - Accelerated imaging is highly relevant for many CMR applications as competing
      constraints with respect to spatiotemporal resolution and tolerable scan times
      are frequently posed. Three approaches, all involving data undersampling to
      increase scan efficiencies, are discussed in this review. Zonal imaging can be
      considered a niche but nevertheless has found application in coronary imaging and
      CMR flow measurements. Current work on parallel-transmit systems is expected to
      revive the interest in zonal imaging techniques. The second and main approach to 
      speeding up CMR sequences has been parallel imaging. A wide range of CMR
      applications has benefited from parallel imaging with reduction factors of two to
      three routinely applied for functional assessment, perfusion, viability and
      coronary imaging. Large coil arrays, as are becoming increasingly available, are 
      expected to support reduction factors greater than three to four in particular in
      combination with 3D imaging protocols. Despite these prospects, theoretical work 
      has indicated fundamental limits of coil encoding at clinically available
      magnetic field strengths. In that respect, alternative approaches exploiting
      prior knowledge about the object being imaged as such or jointly with parallel
      imaging have attracted considerable attention. Five to eight-fold scan
      accelerations in cine and dynamic CMR applications have been reported and image
      quality has been found to be favorable relative to using parallel imaging
      alone.With all acceleration techniques, careful consideration of the limits and
      the trade-off between acceleration and occurrence of artifacts that may arise if 
      these limits are breached is required. In parallel imaging the spatially varying 
      noise has to be considered when measuring contrast- and signal-to-noise ratios.
      Also, temporal fidelity in images reconstructed with prior knowledge driven
      methods has to be studied carefully.

TI  - Determination of peptide backbone torsion angles using double-quantum dipolar
      recoupling solid-state NMR spectroscopy.
PG  - 2202-12
LID - 10.1021/ja074244w [doi]
AB  - Several approaches for utilizing dipolar recoupling solid-state NMR (ssNMR)
      techniques to determine local structure at high resolution in peptides and
      proteins have been developed. However, many of these techniques measure only one 
      torsion angle or are accurate for only certain classes of secondary structure.
      Additionally, the efficiency with which these dipolar recoupling experiments
      suppress the deleterious effects of chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) at high
      magnetic field strengths varies. Dipolar recoupling with a windowless sequence
      (DRAWS) has proven to be an effective pulse sequence for exciting double-quantum 
      (DQ) coherences between adjacent carbonyl carbons along the peptide backbone. By 
      allowing this DQ coherence to evolve, it is possible to measure the relative
      orientations of the CSA tensors and subsequently use this information to
      determine the Ramachandran torsion angles phi and psi. Here, we explore the
      accuracies of the assumptions made in interpreting DQ-DRAWS data and demonstrate 
      their fidelity in measuring torsion angles corresponding to a variety of
      secondary structures irrespective of hydrogen-bonding patterns. It is shown how a
      simple choice of isotopic labels and experimental conditions allows accurate
      measurement of backbone secondary structures without any prior knowledge. This
      approach is considerably more sensitive for determining structure in helices and 
      has comparable accuracy for beta-sheet and extended conformations relative to
      other methods. We also illustrate the ability of DQ-DRAWS to distinguish between 
      structures in heterogeneous samples.

      beat-to-beat repolarization measurements.
PG  - 5-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: According to previous studies, the complex substrate of malignant
      arrhythmias needs a detailed spatio-temporal noninvasive characterization of
      low-amplitude dynamic changes in beat-to-beat cardiac repolarization. METHODS:
      Body surface potential map (BSPM) records were taken on 14 healthy male and
      female subjects (age 20-80 years) and on 6 ventricular arrhythmia patients, 4 of 
      them with implanted cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). Records were taken
      continuously, for 5 minutes, in resting, supine position. Beat-to-beat QRST
      integral maps, Karhunen-Loeve coefficient time-series (KLi, i=1-12), RR and
      nondipolarity index (NDI) time-series were computed. RESULTS: The first order
      statistical properties of the spatio-temporal variability of subsequent QRST
      integral maps were characterized by the box and whiskers plot of their KLi
      components. The SD2/M2 (KLi amplitude variance/mean signal energy) values of the 
      QRST integral maps in the normal group ranged between 0.0057 and 0.008 (i.e.
      0.075=or<SD/M=or<0.089). In ICD patients SD2/M2 values went up to 0.021-0.069
      (i.e: 0.14=or<SD/M=or<0.26). Autocorrelation functions revealed that while in
      normal subjects only 5-20% of the total power had white noise character, the rest
      was bandwidth-limited noise. In ICD patients the weight of white noise component 
      increased considerably. The higher the SD/M relative KL variability, the higher
      and more frequent NDI spikes were. CONCLUSIONS: Beat-to-beat dynamics of white
      noise components of high resolution BSPMs are able to stratify arrhythmia
      vulnerability. The temporal distribution of extreme NDI spike formations is
      random; the frequency is associated with the relative KL component noise levels.

TI  - Electrophoretic chip for high-fidelity fractionation of double-stranded DNA.
PG  - 1572-8
AB  - We report the high fidelity, on-chip fractionation of selected segments from an
      electrophoretic flow of separated fragments. dsDNA fragments (10-330 base pairs
      (bp)) were initially separated using a 6.5 cm long channel with an electric field
      strength of 150 V/cm. As an example of the fractionation process, a target
      fragment of 20 bp was selected and extracted from the separation channel. The
      extraction was confirmed and evaluated by fluorescence imaging. High resolution
      and extraction fidelity were achieved by introducing new procedures for (i)
      extraction channel-blocking and (ii) segment transfer with cleaning. These
      procedures are necessary for the development of a practical, fully automated
      multitarget fractionation electrophoretic chip. A kind of CCD image processing
      method was introduced to monitor, control, and evaluate the procedure of
      fractionation. The resolution limits of the separation and extraction are
      discussed.

TI  - Wavelet restoration of medical pulse-echo ultrasound images in an EM framework.
PG  - 550-68
AB  - The clinical utility of pulse-echo ultrasound images is severely limited by
      inherent poor resolution that impacts negatively on their diagnostic potential.
      Research into the enhancement of image quality has mostly been concentrated in
      the areas of blind image restoration and speckle removal, with little regard for 
      accurate modeling of the underlying tissue reflectivity that is imaged. The
      acoustic response of soft biological tissues has statistics that differ
      substantially from the natural images considered in mainstream image processing: 
      although, on a macroscopic scale, the overall tissue echogenicity does behave
      some-what like a natural image and varies piecewise-smoothly, on a microscopic
      scale, the tissue reflectivity exhibits a pseudo-random texture (manifested in
      the amplitude image as speckle) due to the dense concentrations of small, weakly 
      scattering particles. Recognizing that this pseudorandom texture is
      diagnostically important for tissue identification, we propose modeling tissue
      reflectivity as the product of a piecewise-smooth echogenicity map and a field of
      uncorrelated, identically distributed random variables. We demonstrate how this
      model of tissue reflectivity can be exploited in an expectation-maximization (EM)
      algorithm that simultaneously solves the image restoration problem and the
      speckle removal problem by iteratively alternating between Wiener filtering (to
      solve for the tissue reflectivity) and wavelet-based denoising (to solve for the 
      echogenicity map). Our simulation and in vitro results indicate that our EM
      algorithm is capable of producing restored images that have better image quality 
      and greater fidelity to the true tissue reflectivity than other restoration
      techniques based on simpler regularizing constraints.

TI  - Forensic visualization of foreign matter in human tissue by near-infrared
      spectral imaging: methodology and data mining strategies.
PG  - 888-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapidity of data acquisition, high image fidelity and large field of 
      view are of tremendous value when looking for chemical contaminants or for the
      proverbial "needle in the haystack" - in this case foreign inclusions in
      histologic sections of biopsy or autopsy tissues. Near infrared chemical imaging 
      is one of three chemical imaging techniques (NIR, MIR and Raman) based on
      vibrational spectroscopy, and provides distinct technical advantages for this
      application. METHODS: We have chosen to utilize and evaluate near infrared (NIR) 
      imaging for studies of foreign materials in tissue because the experimental
      configuration is relatively simple, data collection is rapid, and large sample
      areas can be screened with high image fidelity and spatial resolution. RESULTS:
      We have shown that NIR imaging can readily find and identify silicone gel
      inclusions in biological tissue samples. Additionally, preliminary results
      indicate that spectral signatures in the data set are also potentially sensitive 
      to structural changes in the surrounding tissue that may be induced by the
      foreign body. CONCLUSIONS: NIR chemical imaging is a powerful, non-destructive
      tool for localization and identifying foreign contaminants in biological tissue. 
      Preliminary results indicate that NIR imaging is also sensitive enough to
      differentiate tissue types (perhaps based on collagen structural differences),
      and provide data on the spatial localization of these components.

TI  - Comparison of 10 digital SLR cameras for orthodontic photography.
PG  - 223-30
AB  - Digital photography is now widely used to document orthodontic patients. High
      quality intra-oral photography depends on a satisfactory 'depth of field' focus
      and good illumination. Automatic 'through the lens' (TTL) metering is ideal to
      achieve both the above aims. Ten current digital single lens reflex (SLR) cameras
      were tested for use in intra- and extra-oral photography as used in orthodontics.
      The manufacturers' recommended macro-lens and macro-flash were used with each
      camera. Handling characteristics, colour-reproducibility, quality of the
      viewfinder and flash recharge time were investigated. No camera took acceptable
      images in factory default setting or 'automatic' mode: this mode was not present 
      for some cameras (Nikon, Fujifilm); led to overexposure (Olympus) or poor depth
      of field (Canon, Konica-Minolta, Pentax), particularly for intra-oral views. Once
      adjusted, only Olympus cameras were able to take intra- and extra-oral
      photographs without the need to change settings, and were therefore the easiest
      to use. All other cameras needed adjustments of aperture (Canon, Konica-Minolta, 
      Pentax), or aperture and flash (Fujifilm, Nikon), making the latter the most
      complex to use. However, all cameras produced high quality intra- and extra-oral 
      images, once appropriately adjusted. The resolution of the images is more than
      satisfactory for all cameras. There were significant differences relating to the 
      quality of colour reproduction, size and brightness of the viewfinders. The Nikon
      D100 and Fujifilm S 3 Pro consistently scored best for colour fidelity. Pentax
      and Konica-Minolta had the largest and brightest viewfinders.

TI  - Blood flow in major blood vessels-modeling and experiments.
PG  - 1710-3
AB  - Although primarily motivated by an interest in atherosclerosis, modeling of
      arterial blood flow is also important to an understanding of congenital effects
      and to improvements in therapeutics. A variety of methods are available to
      estimate the flow field in living arteries, each with its own advantages and
      limitations. Tradeoffs must be made among the realism of the technique, spatial
      resolution, geometric fidelity, and the reliability of assumed wall mechanical
      properties. Once the velocity field is obtained, each differentiation, to obtain 
      wall shear or its spatial or temporal derivatives, adds additional uncertainty
      into the results, demanding cautious interpretation. A distinction is made
      between "macro" and "micro" levels of flow structure detail: macro level
      structure is relatively coarse and more descriptive of the flow field, pressure, 
      and shear distribution than the cellular response; the micro approach tries to
      relate a more local hemodynamic description to vascular pathology. The
      applications of each, and the interactions between them, are described. Issues
      related to these approaches, including the use of clinical data, animal
      experimentation, the role of cell and organ culture, and in vivo flow
      measurement, are briefly discussed. The summary closes with a list of
      recommendations for future developments in this area.

TI  - High-resolution quantitative phase-contrast microscopy by digital holography.
PG  - 8693-8
AB  - Techniques of digital holography are improved in order to obtain high-resolution,
      high-fidelity images of quantitative phase-contrast microscopy. In particular,
      the angular spectrum method of calculating holographic optical field is seen to
      have significant advantages including tight control of spurious noise components.
      Holographic phase images are obtained with 0.5 mum diffraction-limited lateral
      resolution and largely immune from the coherent noise common in other holographic
      techniques. The phase profile is accurate to about 30 nm of optical thickness.
      Images of SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells display intracellular and intranuclear
      organelles with clarity and quantitative accuracy.

TI  - Fluorescence methods to detect phase boundaries in lipid bilayer mixtures.
PG  - 186-92
AB  - Phase diagrams of lipid mixtures can show several different regions of phase
      coexistence, which include liquid-disordered, liquid-ordered, and gel phases.
      Some phase regions are small, and some have sharp boundaries. The identity of the
      phases, their location in composition space, and the nature of the transitions
      between the phases are important for understanding the behavior of lipid
      mixtures. High fidelity phase boundary detection requires high compositional
      resolution, on the order of 2% compositional increments. Sample artifacts,
      especially the precipitation of crystals of anhydrous cholesterol, can occur at
      higher cholesterol concentrations unless precautions are taken. Fluorescence
      resonance energy transfer (FRET) can be used quantitatively to find the phase
      boundaries and even partition coefficients of the dyes between coexisting phases,
      but only if data are properly corrected for non-FRET contributions.
      Self-quenching of the dye fluorescence can be significant, distorting the data at
      dye concentrations that intuitively might be considered acceptable. Even more
      simple than FRET experiments, measurements of single-dye fluorescence can be used
      to find phase boundaries. Both FRET and single-dye fluorescence readily detect
      the formation of phase domains that are much smaller than the wavelength of
      light, i.e. "nanoscopic" domains.

TI  - User interface paradigms for patient-specific surgical planning: lessons learned 
      over a decade of research.
PG  - 203-22
AB  - This paper covers work in virtual reality-based, patient-specific surgical
      planning over the past decade. It aims to comprehensively examine the user
      interface paradigms and system designs during that period of time and to
      objectively analyze their effectiveness for the task. The goal is to provide
      useful feedback on these interface and implementation paradigms to aid other
      researchers in this field. First, specialized systems for specific clinical use
      were produced with a limited set of visualization tools. Later, through
      collaboration with NASA, an immersive virtual environment was created to produce 
      high-fidelity images for surgical simulation, but it underestimated the
      importance of collaboration. The next system, a networked, distributed virtual
      environment, provided immersion and collaboration, but the immersive paradigm was
      found to be of a disadvantage and the uniqueness of the framework unwieldy. A
      virtual model, workbench-style display was then created using a commercial
      package, but limitations of each were soon apparent. Finally, a specialized
      display, with an integrated visualization and simulation system is described and 
      evaluated. Lessons learned include: surgical planning is an abstract process
      unlike surgical simulation; collaboration is important, as is stereo
      visualization; and that high-resolution preoperative images from standard
      viewpoints are desirable, but interaction is truly the key to planning.

TI  - Zero- to low-field MRI with averaging of concomitant gradient fields.
PG  - 1840-2
AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) encounters fundamental limits in circumstances
      in which the static magnetic field is not sufficiently strong to truncate
      unwanted, so-called concomitant components of the gradient field. This limitation
      affects the attainable optimal image fidelity and resolution most prominently in 
      low-field imaging. In this article, we introduce the use of pulsed magnetic-field
      averaging toward relaxing these constraints. It is found that the image of an
      object can be retrieved by pulsed low fields in the presence of the full spatial 
      variation of the imaging encoding gradient field even in the absence of the
      typical uniform high-field time-independent contribution. In addition,
      error-compensation schemes can be introduced through the application of
      symmetrized pulse sequences. Such schemes substantially mitigate artifacts
      related to evolution in strong magnetic-field gradients, magnetic fields that
      vary in direction and orientation, and imperfections of the applied field pulses.

TI  - Detection sensitivity and temporal resolution of visual signals near absolute
      threshold in the salamander retina.
PG  - 318-30
AB  - Several studies have suggested that the visual system can detect dim lights with 
      a fidelity limited only by Poisson fluctuations in photon absorption and
      spontaneous activation of rhodopsin. If correct, this implies that neural
      processing of responses produced by rod photoreceptors is efficient and
      effectively noiseless. However, experimental uncertainty makes this conclusion
      tenuous. Furthermore, previous work provided no information about how accurately 
      stimulus timing is represented. Here, the detection sensitivity and temporal
      resolution of salamander rods and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are compared in
      nearly matched experimental conditions by using recorded responses to identify
      the time of a flash. At detection threshold, RGCs could reliably signal the
      absorption of 20-50 photons, but the rods within the RGC receptive field could
      signal stimuli 3-10 times weaker. For flash strengths 10 times higher than
      detection threshold, some RGCs could distinguish stimulus timing with a
      resolution finer than 100 msec, within a factor of 2 of the rod limit. The
      relationship between RGC and rod sensitivity could not be explained by added
      noise in the retinal circuitry but could be explained by a threshold acting after
      pooling of rod signals. Simulations of rod signals indicated that continuous
      noise, rather than spontaneous activation of rhodopsin or fluctuations in the
      single-photon response, limited temporal resolution. Thus, detection of dim
      lights was limited by retinal processing, but, at higher light levels, synaptic
      transmission, cellular integration of synaptic inputs, and spike generation in
      RGCs faithfully conveyed information about the time of photon absorption.

TI  - Weakly inhomogeneous media tomography.
PG  - 122-33
AB  - Our objective is to develop an ultrasonic scanner for breast imaging. High
      resolution is obtained by using wide-band spherical waves transmitted and
      measured in the near field zone (i.e., close to the skin) all around the organ.
      The tomographic approach that we adopt allows us to use low central frequency
      waves (3-7 MHz) that are suitable for good penetration while maintaining high
      resolution and contrast. The procedure is thus suitable for early detection of
      tumors and increases the chances of total recovery. The novelty of the present
      reconstruction procedure is that it associates the signals acquired in
      transmission to the data measured in reflection over a large aperture. This
      enables us to correct the phase aberration induced by weak inhomogeneities whose 
      sizes might be several wavelengths. Numerical tests based on Finite Difference
      Time Domain (FDTD) simulations demonstrate the greater fidelity of the
      reconstruction.

TI  - [Application of weighted minimum-norm estimation with Tikhonov regularization for
      neuromagnetic source imaging].
PG  - 157-61
AB  - In magnetoencepholography(MEG) inverse research, according to the point source
      model and distributed source model, the neuromagnetic source reconstruction
      methods are classified as parametric current dipole localization and
      nonparametric source imaging (or current density reconstruction). MEG source
      imaging technique can be formulated as an inherent ill-posed and highly
      underdetermined linear inverse problem. In order to yield a robust and plausible 
      neural current distribution image, various approaches have been proposed. Among
      those, the weighted minimum-norm estimation with Tikhonov regularization is a
      popular technique. The authors present a relatively overall theoretical framework
      Followed by a discussion of the development, several regularized minimum-norm
      algorithms have been described in detail, including the depth normalization, low 
      resolution electromagnetic tomography(LORETA), focal underdetermined system
      solver(FOCUSS), selective minimum-norm(SMN). In addition, some other imaging
      methods, e.g., maximum entropy method(MEM), the method incorporating other brain 
      functional information such as fMRI data and maximum a posteriori(MAP) method
      using Markov random field model, are explained as well. From the generalized
      point of view based on minimum-norm estimation with Tikhonov regularization, all 
      these algorithms are aiming to resolve the tradeoff between fidelity to the
      measured data and the constraints assumptions about the neural source
      configuration such as anatomical and physiological information. In conclusion,
      almost all the source imaging approaches can be consistent with the regularized
      minimum-norm estimation to some extent.

TI  - Three-dimensional localization of ultrasmall immuno-gold labels by HAADF-STEM
      tomography.
PG  - 58-62
AB  - The localization of scarce antigens in thin sections of biological material can
      be accomplished by pre-embedment labeling with ultrasmall immuno-gold labels.
      Moreover, with this method, labeling is not restricted to the section surface but
      occurs throughout the section volume. Thus, when combined with electron
      tomography, antigens can be localized in three dimensions in relation to the 3D
      (three-dimensional) ultrastructure of the cell. However, for visualization in a
      transmission electron microscope, these labels need to be enlarged by silver or
      gold enhancement. The increase in particle size reduces the resolution of the
      antigen detection and the large particles obscure ultrastructural details in the 
      tomogram. In this paper we show for the first time that these problems can be
      avoided and that ultrasmall gold labels can be localized in three dimensions
      without the need for gold or silver enhancement by using HAADF-STEM (high angular
      annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy) tomography. This
      method allowed us to three-dimensionally localize Aurion ultrasmall goat
      anti-rabbit immuno-gold labels on sections of Epon-embedded,
      osmium-uranium-lead-stained biological material. Calculations show that a 3D
      reconstruction obtained from HAADF-STEM projection images can be spatially
      aligned to one obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) projections
      with subpixel accuracy. We conclude that it is possible to combine the
      high-fidelity structural information of TEM tomograms with the ultrasmall label
      localization ability of HAADF-STEM tomograms.

TI  - Nucleotide excision repair "a legacy of creativity".
PG  - 23-36
AB  - The first half of the 20th century has seen an enormous growth in our knowledge
      of DNA repair, in no small part due to the work of Dirk Bootsma, Philip Hanawalt 
      and Bryn Bridges; those honored by this issue. For the new millennium, we have
      asked three general questions: (A) Do we know all possible strategies of
      nucleotide excision repair (NER) in all organisms? (B) How is NER integrated and 
      regulated in cells and tissues? (C) Does DNA replication represent a new frontier
      in the roles of DNA repair? We make some suggestions for the kinds of answers the
      next generation may provide. The kingdom of archea represents an untapped field
      for investigation of DNA repair in organisms with extreme lifestyles. NER appears
      to involve a similar strategy to the other kingdoms of prokaryotes and
      eukaryotes, but subtle differences suggest that individual components of the
      system may differ. NER appears to be regulated by several major factors,
      especially p53 and Rb which interact with transcription coupled repair and global
      genomic repair, respectively. Examples can be found of major regulatory changes
      in repair in testicular tissue and melanoma cells. Our understanding of
      replication of damaged DNA has undergone a revolution in recent years, with the
      discovery of multiple low-fidelity DNA polymerases that facilitate replicative
      bypass. A secondary mechanism of replication in the absence of NER or of one or
      more of these polymerases involves sister chromatid exchange and recombination
      (hMre11/hRad50/Nbs1). The relative importance of bypass and recombination is
      determined by the action of p53. We hypothesise that these polymerases may be
      involved in resolution of complex DNA structures during completion of replication
      and sister chromatid resolution. With these fascinating problems to investigate, 
      the field of DNA repair will surely not disappoint the next generation.

TI  - Telescopic myringotomy and tube application.
PG  - 581-3
AB  - Otoendoscopy is a new technique in otological surgery. The traditional surgery
      for otitis media with effusion (OME) is myringotomy and tube insertion using an
      operating microscope. In 45 children and five adults presenting to our department
      with otitis media with effusion, rigid endoscopic myringotomy and grommet tube
      insertion were performed using 2.7 mm diameter and 0 degree and 30 degrees angle 
      telescopes under general anaesthesia for children and local anaesthesia for
      adults. The use of rigid endoscopes provides a large field of view, that is of
      excellent resolution and fidelity of colour as well as giving good side views. It
      can be performed in the out-patient clinic with little inconvenience to the
      patient and minimal risks.

TI  - Partial-FOV reconstruction in dynamic spiral imaging.
PG  - 429-39
AB  - In many applications of dynamic MR imaging, only a portion of the field-of-view
      (FOV) exhibits considerable variations in time. In such cases, a prior knowledge 
      of the static part of the image allows a partial-FOV reconstruction of the
      dynamic section using only a fraction of the raw data. This method of
      reconstruction generally results in higher temporal resolution, because the scan 
      time for partial-FOV data is shorter. The fidelity of this reconstruction
      technique depends, among other factors, on the accuracy of the prior information 
      of the static section. This information is usually derived from the reconstructed
      images at previous time frames. This data, however, is normally corrupted by the 
      motion artifact Because the temporal frequency contents of the motion artifact is
      very similar to that of the dynamic section, a temporal low-pass filter can
      efficiently remove this artifact from the static data. The bandwidth of the
      filter can be obtained from the rate of variations inside and outside the dynamic
      area. In general, when the temporal bandwidth is not spatially uniform, a bank of
      low-pass filters can provide a proper suppression of the motion artifact outside 
      the dynamic section. This reconstruction technique is adapted for spiral
      acquisition and is successfully applied to cardiac fluoroscopy, doubling the
      temporal resolution.

TI  - Automatic image acquisition, calibration and montage assembly for biological
      X-ray microscopy.
PG  - 185-201
AB  - We describe a system for the automatic acquisition and processing of digital
      images in a high-resolution X-ray microscope, including the formation of
      large-field high-resolution image montages. A computer-controlled sample
      positioning stage provides approximate coordinates for each high-resolution
      subimage. Individual subimages are corrected to compensate for time-varying,
      non-uniform illumination and CCD-related artefacts. They are then automatically
      assembled into a montage. The montage assembly algorithm is designed to use the
      overlap between each subimage and multiple neighbours to improve the performance 
      of the registration step and the fidelity of the result. This is accomplished by 
      explicit use of recorded stage positions, optimized ordering of subimage
      insertion, and registration of subimages to the developing montage. Using this
      procedure registration errors are below the resolution limit of the microscope
      (43 nm). The image produced is a seamless, large-field montage at full
      resolution, assembled automatically without human intervention. Beyond this, it
      is also an accurate X-ray transmission map that allows the quantitative
      measurement of anatomical and chemical features of the sample. Applying these
      tools to a biological problem, we have conducted the largest X-ray microscopical 
      study to date.

TI  - Fidelity of three-dimensional-sound reproduction using a virtual auditory
      display.
PG  - 528-37
AB  - The fidelity of reproducing free-field sounds using a virtual auditory display
      was investigated in two experiments. In the first experiment, listeners directly 
      compared stimuli from an actual loudspeaker in the free field with those from
      small headphones placed in front of the ears. Headphone stimuli were filtered
      using head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), recorded while listeners were
      wearing the headphones, in order to reproduce the pressure signatures of the
      free-field sounds at the eardrum. Discriminability was investigated for six
      sound-source positions using broadband noise as a stimulus. The results show that
      the acoustic percepts of real and virtual sounds were identical. In the second
      experiment, discrimination between virtual sounds generated with measured and
      interpolated HRTFs was investigated. Interpolation was performed using HRTFs
      measured for loudspeaker positions with different spatial resolutions. Broadband 
      noise bursts with flat and scrambled spectra were used as stimuli. The results
      indicate that, for a spatial resolution of about 6 degrees, the interpolation
      does not introduce audible cues. For resolutions of 20 degrees or more, the
      interpolation introduces audible cues related to timbre and position. For
      intermediate resolutions (10 degrees - 15 degrees) the data suggest that only
      timbre cues were used.

TI  - The role and future of endoscopic imaging systems.
PG  - 557-62
AB  - Visual perception is the main sensory input from the environment in most
      situations of daily life. It is the only sensory input from the operating field
      in endoscopic surgery, and thus the qualities of the optical imaging system have 
      a considerable impact on the course of the surgical intervention. Significant
      improvements have been made recently in various fields of science and
      engineering, influencing endoscopic imaging systems in experimental and clinical 
      use. Among these are technologies that improve the endoscope itself in terms of
      providing new visual features, such as fogging prevention and plastic images,
      using new illumination techniques. Other developments concern the improvement of 
      image resolution and color fidelity through new charge-coupled device (CCD)
      sensors or alternative techniques for image creation. Finally, the combination of
      endoscopic technologies with robotics provides for intuitive and more efficient
      direction of the line of sight.

TI  - Video on the Internet: An introduction to the digital encoding, compression, and 
      transmission of moving image data.
PG  - 133-55
AB  - In this paper, we seek to provide an introduction to the fast-moving field of
      digital video on the Internet, from the viewpoint of the biological microscopist 
      who might wish to store or access videos, for instance in image databases such as
      the BioImage Database (http://www.bioimage.org). We describe and evaluate the
      principal methods used for encoding and compressing moving image data for digital
      storage and transmission over the Internet, which involve compromises between
      compression efficiency and retention of image fidelity, and describe the existing
      alternate software technologies for downloading or streaming compressed digitized
      videos using a Web browser. We report the results of experiments on video
      microscopy recordings and three-dimensional confocal animations of biological
      specimens to evaluate the compression efficiencies of the principal video
      compression-decompression algorithms (codecs) and to document the artefacts
      associated with each of them. Because MPEG-1 gives very high compression while
      yet retaining reasonable image quality, these studies lead us to recommend that
      video databases should store both a high-resolution original version of each
      video, ideally either uncompressed or losslessly compressed, and a separate
      edited and highly compressed MPEG-1 preview version that can be rapidly
      downloaded for interactive viewing by the database user.

PG  - 361-7
AB  - Cell biologists probing the physiologic movement of macromolecules and solutes
      across the fenestrated microvascular endothelial cell have used electron
      microscopy to locate the postulated pore within the fenestrae. Prior to the
      advent of in-lens field-emission high-resolution scanning electron microscopy
      (HRSEM) and ultrathin metal coating technology, quick-freeze, platinum-carbon
      replica and grazing thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods
      provided two-dimensional or indirect imaging methods. Wedge-shaped octagonal
      channels composed of fibrils interwoven in a central mesh were depicted as the
      filtering structures of fenestral diaphragms in images of platinum replicas
      enhanced by photographic augmentation. However, image accuracy was limited to
      replication of the cell surface. Subsequent to this, HRSEM technology was
      developed and provided a high-fidelity, three-dimensional topographic image of
      the fenestral surface directly from a fixed and dried bulk adrenal specimen
      coated with a 1 nm chromium film. First described from TEM replicas, the
      "flower-like" structure comprising the fenestral pores was readily visualized by 
      HRSEM. High-resolution images contained particulate ectodomains on the lumenal
      surface of the endothelial cell membrane. Particles arranged in a rough octagonal
      shape formed the fenestral rim. Digital acquisition of analog photographic
      recordings revealed a filamentous meshwork in the diaphragm, thus confirming and 
      extending observations from replica and grazing section TEM preparations.
      Endothelial cell pockets, first described in murine renal peritubular
      capillaries, were observed in rhesus and rabbit adrenocortical capillaries. This 
      report features recent observations of fenestral diaphragms and endothelial
      pockets fitted with multiple diaphragms utilizing a Schottky field-emission
      electron microscope. In-lens staging of bulk and thin section specimens allowed
      tandem imaging in HRSEM and scanning TEM modes at 25 kV.

TI  - Toroidal geometry: novel three-dimensional intracardiac imaging with a
      phased-array transducer.
PG  - 493-8
AB  - Recent advances in small, linear-array transducers have opened new avenues for
      three-dimensional image acquisition from an intracardiac approach. The purpose of
      this study was to introduce a novel method of image acquisition using toroidal
      geometry, explore its fidelity of reproduction of three-dimensional cardiac
      anatomy, and determine whether a whole-heart scan is achievable. Acquisition was 
      accomplished through 360-degree incremental rotation of a rigid endoscope with a 
      side-mounted ultrasound transducer. The procedure was first tested with the use
      of a gelatin model to define far-field slice resolution with 1.8-degree
      rotational increments. Comparison of three-dimensional scans of cardiac specimens
      with corresponding photographs confirmed that toroidal geometry can provide a
      high-quality display of structures from all sides. We conclude that whole-heart
      three-dimensional scanning from within the cardiac chambers is possible with
      toroidal geometry. The quality of depicted anatomy depends on transducer location
      within the heart, distance from the transducer, density of slices, and image
      resolution. The potential of intracardiac three-dimensional ultrasound imaging
      includes detailed spatial evaluation of cardiac morphology, determination of
      appropriate placement of investigative or therapeutic devices (catheters, closure
      devices, etc.), and assessment of cardiac function.

TI  - An overlapping tree approach to multiscale stochastic modeling and estimation.
PG  - 1517-29
AB  - Recently, a class of multiscale stochastic models has been introduced in which
      random processes and fields are described by scale-recursive dynamic trees. A
      major advantage of this framework is that it leads to an extremely efficient,
      statistically optimal algorithm for least-squares estimation. In certain
      applications, however, estimates based on the types of multiscale models
      previously proposed may not be adequate, as they have tended to exhibit a
      visually distracting blockiness. We eliminate this blockiness by discarding the
      standard assumption that distinct nodes on a given level of the multiscale
      process correspond to disjoint portions of the image domain; instead, we allow a 
      correspondence to overlapping portions of the image domain. We use these
      so-called overlapping-tree models for both modeling and estimation. In
      particular, we develop an efficient multiscale algorithm for generating sample
      paths of a random field whose second-order statistics match a prespecified
      covariance structure, to any desired degree of fidelity. Furthermore, we
      demonstrate that under easily satisfied conditions, we can "lift" a random field 
      estimation problem to one defined on an overlapped tree, resulting in an
      estimation algorithm that is computationally efficient, directly produces
      estimation error covariances, and eliminates blockiness in the reconstructed
      imagery without any sacrifice in the resolution of fine-scale detail.

TI  - Transfer characteristics of X LGN neurons in cats reared with early discordant
      binocular vision.
PG  - 2558-72
AB  - 1. The effects of early discordant binocular vision on the functional development
      of the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) were investigated by quantitatively
      comparing responses of individual LGN neurons with their direct retinal inputs.
      2. Unilateral convergent strabismus (esotropia) was surgically induced in 11
      kittens at the age of 3 wk. After the animals had reached 9 mo of age,
      extracellular microelectrode recordings were made from individual X LGN units in 
      lamina A and A1 of anesthetized and paralyzed cats. Responses were measured for
      drifting sinusoidal gratings. Within-unit comparisons of LGN action potentials
      (LGN output) and S potentials (retinal input) were performed to determine the
      nature of signal transfer in the units driven by the deviating (N = 42) or
      nondeviating eyes (N = 29) of strabismic cats. The results were compared with
      similar data (N = 29) obtained from nine normal control cats. 3. The spatial
      resolution of many individual LGN units in strabismic cats was abnormally reduced
      relative to their retinal inputs. These differences were more pronounced in units
      that received inputs from the nasal retina of the contralateral eye. The
      resolution loss was closely associated with a dramatic decrease in the strength
      of the receptive field center mechanism of LGN units relative to their retinal
      inputs. Moreover, the efficiency of signal transfer for high-spatial-frequency
      stimuli, determined by the transfer ratio (response amplitude of LGN action
      potentials/amplitude of S potentials), was significantly lower in strabismic cats
      compared with normal controls. 4. In strabismic cats, contrast thresholds for the
      action potentials of individual LGN units were significantly higher than those
      determined for the S potentials. In normal cats, the input-output differences in 
      contrast threshold were negligible. The observed contrast sensitivity loss was
      more pronounced for high-spatial-frequency stimuli. 5. The speed of signal
      transfer was significantly decreased in the LGNs of strabismic animals. The
      visual response latencies of many, but not all, X LGN cells in the strabismic
      cats were abnormally long when compared with those in normal control units,
      whereas SP latencies were virtually the same for strabismic and normal cats.
      Abnormal latencies were prevalent in units that exhibited contrast threshold
      deficits, and were more severe among the units receiving input from the
      contralateral nasal retina. 6. The deficits in strabismic cats were found in the 
      LGN units innervated by the deviating and nondeviating eyes. However, for the
      majority of response measures, the units innervated by the deviating eyes showed 
      notably larger deficits. 7. We conclude that the fidelity of signal transfer from
      the retina to the LGN is significantly reduced in cats reared with discordant
      binocular visual experience. Thus the adverse effects of early strabismus are not
      confined, at least in cats, to the visual cortex.

TI  - Site fidelity in foraging wood-ants Formica aquilonia yarrow and its influence on
      the distribution of foragers in a regenerating environment.
PG  - 309-21
LID - 10.1016/0376-6357(94)90016-7 [doi]
AB  - The proportions of the population of red wood-ants Formica aquilonia Yarrow,
      foraging for sucrose at two artificial feeding sites in the laboratory,
      approximated to those predicted by the ideal free distribution (Lamb and Ollason,
      1993). It was assumed that, for the foraging population to attain the ideal free 
      distribution, each individual would visit and assess the availability of food at 
      both feeding sites and distribute its foraging effort in proportion to the rate
      of regeneration of food. In order to demonstrate this, large samples of foragers 
      at each of the feeding sites were colour-marked according to site. It was
      expected that the marked sample of foragers would in time become distributed as
      predicted by the ideal free distribution; instead, the distribution of marked
      ants was biased toward the site where they had been marked. Hence some
      individuals are not continually visiting and feeding at both patches, and such
      individuals will not be able directly to assess their feeding rates at each
      patch. There is, in principle, no way that such individuals can distribute
      themselves as predicted by the ideal free distribution, and as the site-faithful 
      ants form a large proportion of the population, it appears that there is no way
      that the members of such a population can become so distributed. One resolution
      of this apparent paradox is provided by the behaviour of the mobile ants, the
      existence of which is demonstrated by observations of marked ants foraging at the
      site other than that at which they were marked. If the mobile members of the
      population assess the quality of both patches and distribute themselves to
      maximise their rates of feeding, the whole population will become distributed as 
      predicted by the ideal free distribution. A modification of Ollason's (1987)
      model shows how this distribution could develop. It emerges that there is a
      minimum proportion of mobile ants in a population, below which the ideal free
      distribution will not develop, and that the distribution of foragers will depart 
      from the ideal free distribution increasingly as the discrepancy between the
      regeneration rates of the patches of food increases.

TI  - Sensitive techniques for the detection of genetic variation in human isozymes.
PG  - 101-24
AB  - The principal means by which genetic variation of enzyme proteins has been
      revealed is the physicochemical separation of isozymes in an electrical field
      followed by their specific detection. This approach is widely applicable to all
      types of species and almost every conceivable kind of tissue homogenate or
      protein secretion. In the human organism alone the products of more than 200
      enzyme loci have been investigated by this means and more than 40 genetically
      determined human isozyme polymorphisms have been identified. Much of this
      progress has been achieved by the use of conventional gel electrophoresis methods
      and isozyme detection schemes that depend on enzyme-catalyzed conversion of
      substrate into chromogens or other types of visible product. However, the
      functional isozyme detection systems are often of limited sensitivity and are
      dependent on the good condition of the biological material under analysis and the
      retention of adequate enzyme activity. Also in some cases, especially where the
      final product of the detection reaction is not an insoluble compound, the
      staining may be so diffuse as to offset the high resolving power of the most
      effective protein separation methods such as isoelectric focusing in ultranarrow 
      pH gradients. The recent development of alternative protein detection methods
      based on immunoblotting offers a new general approach to isozyme analysis and
      overcomes some of the limitations of isozyme detection by functional staining
      methods. The immunoblot methodology is applicable to proteins separated
      electrophoretically on denaturing gels and on native gels, including proteins
      separated by isoelectric focusing, and the fidelity of the high-resolution
      separation techniques appears to be preserved for most proteins by passive or
      electroblot transfer to nitro-cellulose filters. Furthermore this approach
      provides considerable flexibility in the sensitivity and the nature of the final 
      reporter signal that is employed. For example, the reporter signal can be
      amplified by the use of appropriate intermediate reagents to provide a level of
      detection sensitivity for isozyme proteins which should, even with the present
      procedures, be far in excess of that which is obtained even by the best
      functional isozyme staining system. Also the use of an evanescent reporter system
      such as chemiluminescence may allow multiple analyses of the same immunoblot and 
      hence examination of several different isozyme systems by sequentially using
      different primary antibodies.

TI  - Optimal control solutions to the magnetic resonance selective excitation problem.
PG  - 106-15
AB  - Most magnetic resonance imaging sequences employ field gradients and amplitude
      modulated RF pulses to excite only those spins lying in a specific plane. The
      fidelity of the resulting magnetization distribution is crucial to overall image 
      resolution. Conventional RF-pulse design techniques rely on the small tip-angle
      approximation to Bloch's equation, which is inadequate for the design of 90
      degrees and 180 degrees pulses. This paper demonstrates the existence of a
      selective pulse, and provides a sound mathematical and computational basis for
      pulse design. It is shown that the pulses are optimal in the class of piecewise
      continuous functions of duration T. An optimal pulse is defined as the pulse on
      the interval that achieves a magnetization profile "closest" to the desired
      distribution. Optimal control theory provides the mathematical basis for the new 
      pulse design technique. Computer simulations have verified the efficacy of the 90
      degrees and the 180 degrees inversion and "pancake-flip" optimal pulses.

TI  - THE VISUAL ACUITY OF THE HONEY BEE.
PG  - 727-60
AB  - 1. Bees respond by a characteristic reflex to a movement in their visual field.
      By confining the field to a series of parallel dark and luminous bars it is
      possible to determine the size of bar to which the bees respond under different
      conditions and in this way to measure the resolving power or visual acuity of the
      eye. The maximum visual acuity of the bee is lower than the lowest human visual
      acuity. Under similar, maximal conditions the fineness of resolution of the human
      eye is about 100 times that of the bee. 2. The eye of the bee is a mosaic
      composed of hexagonal pyramids of variable apical angle. The size of this angle
      determines the angular separation between adjacent ommatidia and therefore sets
      the structural limits to the resolving power of the eye. It is found that the
      visual angle corresponding to the maximum visual acuity as found experimentally
      is identical with the structural angular separation of adjacent ommatidia in the 
      region of maximum density of ommatidia population. When this region of maximum
      ommatidia population is rendered non-functional by being covered with an opaque
      paint, the maximum visual acuity then corresponds to the angular separation of
      those remaining ommatidia which now constitute the maximum density of population.
      3. The angular separation of adjacent ommatidia is much smaller in the vertical
      (dorso-ventral) axis than in the horizontal (anterio-posterior) axis. The
      experimentally found visual acuity varies correspondingly. From this and other
      experiments as well as from the shape of the eye itself, it is shown that the
      bee's eye is essentially an instrument for uni-directional visual resolution,
      functional along the dorso-ventral axis. The resolution of the visual pattern is 
      therefore determined by the vertical angular separation of those ocular elements 
      situated in the region of maximum density of ommatidia population. 4. The visual 
      acuity of the bee varies with the illumination in much the same way that it does 
      for the human eye. It is low at low illuminations; as the intensity of
      illumination increases it increases at first slowly and then rapidly; and finally
      at high intensities it becomes constant. The resolving power of a structure like 
      the bee's eye depends on the distance which separates the discrete receiving
      elements. The data then mean that at low illuminations the distance between
      receiving elements is large and that this distance decreases as the illumination 
      increases. Since such a moving system cannot be true anatomically it must be
      interpreted functionally. It is therefore proposed that the threshold of the
      various ommatidia are not the same but that they vary as any other characteristic
      of a population. The visual acuity will then depend on the distance apart of
      those elements whose thresholds are such that they are functional at the
      particular illumination under investigation. Taking due consideration of the
      angular separation of ommatidia it is possible to derive a distribution curve for
      the thresholds of the ommatidia which resembles the usual probability curves, and
      which describes the data with complete fidelity.
