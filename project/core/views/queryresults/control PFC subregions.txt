TI  - Functional and Neuroanatomic Specificity of Episodic Memory Dysfunction in
      Schizophrenia: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of the Relational
      and Item-Specific Encoding Task.
PG  - 909-16
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0276 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Individuals with schizophrenia can encode item-specific information
      to support familiarity-based recognition but are disproportionately impaired
      encoding interitem relationships (relational encoding) and recollecting
      information. The Relational and Item-Specific Encoding (RiSE) paradigm has been
      used to disentangle these encoding and retrieval processes, which may depend on
      specific medial temporal lobe (MTL) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) subregions.
      Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging during RiSE task performance could
      help to specify dysfunctional neural circuits in schizophrenia that can be
      targeted for interventions to improve memory and functioning in the illness.
      OBJECTIVES: To use fMRI to test the hypothesis that schizophrenia
      disproportionately affects MTL and PFC subregions during relational encoding and 
      retrieval relative to item-specific memory processes, and to use fMRI results
      from healthy individuals serving as controls to establish neural construct
      validity for RiSE. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multisite,
      case-control, cross-sectional fMRI study was conducted between November 1, 2010, 
      and May 30, 2012, at 5 Cognitive Neuroscience Test Reliability and Clinical
      Applications for Schizophrenia sites. The final sample included 52 outpatients
      with clinically stable schizophrenia and 57 demographically matched healthy
      control participants. Data analysis was performed between February 1, 2013, and
      May 30, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Behavioral performance speed and
      accuracy (d') on item recognition and associative recognition tasks. Voxelwise
      statistical parametric maps for a priori MTL and PFC regions of interest to test 
      activation differences between relational and item-specific memory during
      encoding and retrieval. RESULTS: Item recognition was disproportionately impaired
      in patients with schizophrenia relative to healthy control participants following
      relational encoding (F1,107 = 4.7; P = .03). The differential deficit was
      accompanied by reduced dorsolateral PFC activation during relational encoding in 
      patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy control participants (z > 2.3; 
      P < .05 corrected). Retrieval success (hits > misses) was associated with
      hippocampal activation in healthy control participants during relational item
      recognition and associative recognition conditions, and hippocampal activation
      was specifically reduced in schizophrenia for recognition of relational but not
      item-specific information (z > 2.3; P < .05 corrected). CONCLUSIONS AND
      RELEVANCE: In this unique, multisite fMRI study, results in the healthy control
      group supported RiSE construct validity by revealing expected memory effects in
      PFC and MTL subregions during encoding and retrieval. Comparison of schizophrenic
      and healthy control participants revealed disproportionate memory deficits in
      schizophrenia for relational vs item-specific information, accompanied by
      regionally and functionally specific deficits in dorsolateral PFC and hippocampal
      activation.

      seeking.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex plays an important role in shaping cognition and behavior. 
      Many studies have shown that medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in 
      seeking, extinction, and reinstatement of cocaine seeking in rodent models of
      relapse. Subregions of mPFC appear to play distinct roles in these behaviors,
      such that the prelimbic cortex (PL) is proposed to drive cocaine seeking and the 
      infralimbic cortex (IL) is proposed to suppress cocaine seeking after extinction.
      This dichotomy of mPFC function may be a general attribute, as similar
      dorsal-ventral distinctions exist for expression vs. extinction of fear
      conditioning. However, other results indicate that the role of mPFC neurons in
      reward processing is more complex than a simple PL-seek vs. IL-extinguish
      dichotomy. Both PL and IL have been shown to drive and inhibit drug seeking (and 
      other types of behaviors) depending on a range of factors including the
      behavioral context, the drug-history of the animal, and the type of drug
      investigated. This heterogeneity of findings may reflect multiple subcircuits
      within each of these PFC areas supporting unique functions. It may also reflect
      the fact that the mPFC plays a multifaceted role in shaping cognition and
      behavior, including those overlapping with cocaine seeking and extinction. Here
      we discuss research leading to the hypothesis that dorsal and ventral mPFC
      differentially control drug seeking and extinction. We also present recent
      results calling the absolute nature of a PL vs. IL dichotomy into question.
      Finally, we consider alternate functions for mPFC that correspond less to
      response execution and inhibition and instead incorporate the complex cognitive
      behavior for which the mPFC is broadly appreciated. This article is part of a
      Special Issue entitled Addiction circuits.

AB  - Globally, over 25% of all children under the age of 5 years experience
      malnutrition leading to cognitive and emotional impairments that can persist into
      adulthood and beyond. We use a rodent model to determine the impact of prenatal
      protein malnutrition on executive functions in an attentional set-shifting task
      and metabolic activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) subregions critical to these
      behaviors. Long-Evans dams were provided with a low (6% casein) or adequate (25% 
      casein) protein diet 5 weeks before mating and during pregnancy. At birth, the
      litters were culled to 8 pups and fostered to control dams on the 25% casein
      diet. At postnatal day 90, prenatally malnourished rats were less able to shift
      attentional set and reverse reward contingencies than controls, demonstrating
      cognitive rigidity. Naive same-sexed littermates were assessed for regional brain
      activity using the metabolic marker (14)C-2-deoxyglucose (2DG). The prenatally
      malnourished rats had lower metabolic activity than controls in prelimbic,
      infralimbic, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortices, but had comparable
      activity in the nearby piriform cortex and superior colliculus. This study
      demonstrates that prenatal protein malnutrition in a well-described animal model 
      produces cognitive deficits in tests of attentional set shifting and reversal
      learning, similar to findings of cognitive inflexibility reported in humans
      exposed to early childhood malnutrition.

TI  - Prefrontal dopamine D1 receptors and working memory in schizotypal personality
      disorder: a PET study with [(1)(1)C]NNC112.
PG  - 4231-40
LID - 10.1007/s00213-014-3566-6 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is associated with working
      memory (WM) impairments that are similar to those observed in schizophrenia.
      Imaging studies have suggested that schizophrenia is associated with alterations 
      in dopamine D1 receptor availability in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that may be
      related to the WM impairments that characterize this disorder. OBJECTIVES: The
      aim of this study was to characterize prefrontal D1 receptor availability and its
      relation to WM performance in SPD. METHODS: We used positron emission tomography 
      (PET) and the radiotracer [(11)C]NNC112 with 18 unmedicated SPD and 21 healthy
      control participants; as an index of D1 receptor availability, binding potential 
      (BP) measures (BPF, BPND, and BPP) were calculated for prefrontal and striatal
      subregions. To assess WM, SPD participants completed the 2-back and Paced
      Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). RESULTS: There were no significant group
      differences in PFC BP. BPF and BPP in the medial PFC were significantly
      negatively related to PASAT performance (r s = -0.551, p = .022 and r s = -0.488,
      p = .047, respectively), but BP was not related to 2-back performance.
      CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to what has been found in schizophrenia, SPD was not
      associated with significant alterations in prefrontal D1 receptor availability.
      Similar to previous schizophrenia findings, however, higher prefrontal D1
      receptor availability was associated with poorer WM performance (as measured by
      the PASAT) in SPD. These findings suggest that schizophrenia and SPD may share a 
      common pathophysiological feature related to prefrontal dopamine functioning that
      contributes to WM dysfunction, but that in SPD, alterations in D1 may occur only 
      in a subset of individuals and/or to an extent that is minor relative to what
      occurs in schizophrenia.

PG  - 605-12
LID - 10.1037/neu0000057 [doi]
AB  - Empathy refers to our ability to recognize and share emotions by another human
      being. Impairment may underlie many of the emotional deficits commonly associated
      with a range of neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. The prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) has long been implicated in these processes, but the specific
      contribution of subregions of the PFC remain unclear. Studies regarding the role 
      of subregions of the prefrontal cortex such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
      (vmPFC)-in facial emotion recognition have yielded inconsistent results. The
      present study aimed to investigate the capacity to recognize nonverbal emotional 
      facial expressions in a group of patients with the following: (a) perfusion
      deficits in the vmPFC (vmPFC group; N = 13), (b) hypoperfusions sparing the vmPFC
      (nonvmPFC group; N = 12), and in (c) a control group of healthy volunteers
      (control group; N = 17). Regions of hypoperfusion were identified by means of
      Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). Participants were asked to
      recognize facial expressions of the 7 basic emotions (happiness, fear, surprise, 
      anger, disgust, sadness, or neutral). Detection of facial expressions of fear,
      disgust, and surprise was affected after functional disruption of the vmPFC. The 
      present study confirms the role of the vmPFC in recognizing emotional facial
      expressions.

LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00608 [doi]
AB  - The abilities of switching between and maintaining task rules are fundamental
      aspects of goal-oriented behavior. The PFC is thought to implement the cognitive 
      processes underling such rule-based behavior, but the specific contributions of
      the several cytoarchitecturally distinct subfields of PFC remain poorly
      understood. Here, we used bilateral cryogenic deactivation to investigate the
      relative contributions of two regions of the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC)--the
      inferior dlPFC (idlPFC) area, consisting of the cortex lining the caudal
      principal sulcus, and the dorsally adjacent superior dlPFC (sdlPFC)--to different
      aspects of rule-based behavior. Macaque monkeys performed two variants of a task 
      that required them to alternate unpredictably between eye movements toward
      (prosaccade) or away from (antisaccade) a visual stimulus. In one version of the 
      task, the current rule was overtly cued. In the second, the task rule was uncued,
      and successful performance required the animals to detect rule changes on the
      basis of reward outcome and subsequently maintain the current task rule within
      working memory. Deactivation of the idlPFC impaired the monkeys' ability to
      perform pro- and antisaccades in the uncued task only. In contrast, deactivation 
      of the sdlPFC had no effect on performance in either task. Combined deactivation 
      of idlPFC and sdlPFC impaired performance on antisaccade, but not prosaccade,
      trials in both task variants. These results suggest that the idlPFC is required
      for mnemonic processes involved in maintenance of task rules, whereas both idlPFC
      and sdlPFC together are necessary for the deployment of the cognitive control
      required to perform antisaccades. Together, these data support the concept of a
      functional specialization of subregions within the dlPFC for rule-guided
      behavior.

AB  - The human capacity to maintain an overarching control over mental states and
      behavior relies on multiple, distributed and dynamically interacting brain
      networks, in which prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role. PFC exerts
      top-down executive control over subcortical and posterior cortical areas via
      extensive reciprocal connections. The orbital, lateral, and medial PFC
      subdivisions are associated with distinct executive functions, but their precise 
      roles in large-scale neural networks remain to be determined. The main objective 
      of our research program is to specify cognitive and neural mechanisms that govern
      executive control functions. We study effects of focal PFC lesions on behavioral 
      and electrophysiological correlates of attention and action control utilizing
      experiments that relate to real-life requirements for executive control. We
      provide a selective review of studies on the impact of lesions to PFC subregions 
      on novelty processing, anticipatory attention, and action preparation and motor
      inhibition. The studies provide evidence for the contribution of both lateral,
      dorsomedial and orbital PFC in novelty processing and dynamic contextual
      updating. We also report evidence for a role of lateral PFC in motor preparation 
      and anticipatory attention. In contrast to the common view that orbitofrontal
      cortex plays a general role in inhibitory control, we report findings indicating 
      an involvement in action outcome monitoring rather than in behavioral inhibition 
      as such. We argue that improved understanding of how basic aspects of attentional
      control and inhibition is regulated in the brain, will shed light on the complex 
      behavioral, cognitive and emotional problems experienced by patients with
      executive dysfunction.

AB  - Perseveration is the repetition of a previously appropriate response in a manner,
      or context, which is detrimental to the individual. Although both cocaine
      exposure and prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunctions have been implicated in
      perseverative-like behaviours, the underlying nature of the impairments has been 
      debated. The current study tested whether chronic cocaine exposure and PFC
      lesions induce perseverative-like behaviours by causing insensitivity to
      punishment. Food-restricted male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to respond for 
      sucrose on concurrent schedules of reinforcement. After initial training, rats
      received either a sensitizing regimen of cocaine exposure, or excitotoxic lesions
      to subregions of the PFC. The test of perseveration involved a choice of
      responding between two levers associated with fixed ratio and progressive ratio
      (PR) schedules. Responding on the PR lever was punished by a 1 min timeout
      period. It was found that, unlike control subjects, those exposed to chronic
      cocaine, or with lesions to the medial prefrontal cortex, were significantly
      slower in adapting their responding to avoid punishment. The current study
      provides evidence that both cocaine exposure and lesions to the prefrontal cortex
      can increase perseverative-like responding, although the magnitude and permanence
      of these effects are contingent on the nature of the task.

AB  - Previous neuroimaging research has established that the left ventrolateral
      prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) is involved in long-term memory (LTM) encoding for
      individual items. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is implicated less
      frequently, and one theory that has gained support to explain this discrepancy is
      that DLPFC is involved in forming item-item relational but not item LTM. Given
      that neuroimaging results are correlational, complimentary methods such as
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been used to test causal 
      hypotheses generated from imaging data. Most TMS studies of LTM encoding have
      found that disruption of lateral PFC activity impairs subsequent memory. However 
      these studies have lacked methods to precisely localize and directly compare TMS 
      effects from frontal subregions implicated by the neuroimaging literature. Here, 
      we target specific subregions of lateral PFC with TMS to test the prediction from
      the item/relational framework that temporary disruption of VLPFC during encoding 
      will impair subsequent memory whereas TMS to DLPFC during item encoding will not.
      Frontal TMS was administered prior to a LTM encoding task in which participants
      were presented with a list of individual nouns and asked to judge whether each
      noun was concrete or abstract. After a 40 min delay period, item recognition
      memory was tested. Results indicate that VLPFC and DLPFC TMS have differential
      effects on subsequent item memory. VLPFC TMS reliably disrupted subsequent item
      memory whereas DLPFC TMS led to numerical enhancement in item memory, relative to
      TMS to a control region.

TI  - Social play behavior in adolescent rats is mediated by functional activity in
      medial prefrontal cortex and striatum.
PG  - 1899-909
LID - 10.1038/npp.2013.83 [doi]
AB  - Social play behavior is a characteristic, vigorous form of social interaction in 
      young mammals. It is highly rewarding and thought to be of major importance for
      social and cognitive development. The neural substrates of social play are
      incompletely understood, but there is evidence to support a role for the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum in this behavior. Using pharmacological
      inactivation methods, ie, infusions of GABA receptor agonists (baclofen and
      muscimol; B&M) or the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist
      6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H,4H)-dione (DNQX), we investigated the involvement
      of several subregions of the medial PFC and striatum in social play. Inactivation
      of the prelimbic cortex, infralimbic cortex, and medial/ventral orbitofrontal
      cortex using B&M markedly reduced frequency and duration of social play behavior.
      Local administration of DNQX into the dorsomedial striatum increased the
      frequency and duration of social play, whereas infusion of B&M tended to have the
      same effect. Inactivation of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) core using B&M
      increased duration but not frequency of social play, whereas B&M infusion into
      the NAcc shell did not influence social play behavior. Thus, functional integrity
      of the medial PFC is important for the expression of social play behavior.
      Glutamatergic inputs into the dorsomedial striatum exert an inhibitory influence 
      on social play, and functional activity in the NAcc core acts to limit the length
      of playful interactions. These results highlight the importance of prefrontal and
      striatal circuits implicated in cognitive control, decision making, behavioral
      inhibition, and reward-associated processes in social play behavior.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity confers environmental adaptability through modification of
      the connectivity between neurons and neuronal circuits. This is achieved through 
      changes to synapse-associated signaling systems and supported by complementary
      changes to cellular morphology and metabolism within the tripartite synapse.
      Mounting evidence suggests region-specific changes to synaptic form and function 
      occur as a result of chronic stress and in depression. Within subregions of the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus structural and synapse-related findings
      seem consistent with a deficit in long-term potentiation (LTP) and facilitation
      of long-term depression (LTD), particularly at excitatory pyramidal synapses.
      Other brain regions are less well-studied; however the amygdala may feature a
      somewhat opposite synaptic pathology including reduced inhibitory tone. Changes
      to synaptic plasticity in stress and depression may correlate those to several
      signal transduction pathways (e.g. NOS-NO, cAMP-PKA, Ras-ERK, PI3K-Akt, GSK-3,
      mTOR and CREB) and upstream receptors (e.g. NMDAR, TrkB and p75NTR). Deficits in 
      synaptic plasticity may further correlate disrupted brain redox and
      bioenergetics. Finally, at a functional level region-specific changes to synaptic
      plasticity in depression may relate to maladapted neurocircuitry and parallel
      reduced cognitive control over negative emotion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that people with cocaine
      addiction retain some degree of control over drug craving that correlates with
      neural activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we report similar
      findings in a rat model of inhibitory control of cocaine seeking. METHODS: Rats
      actively responding for cocaine were trained to stop responding when presented
      with a discriminative stimulus that signaled lack of reinforcement. Rats were
      then tested for inhibitory control of cocaine seeking in novel behavioral
      contexts and in circumstances when cocaine seeking is particularly intense (e.g.,
      following drug priming). The role of neuronal activity in different subregions of
      the PFC was assessed using local pharmacologic inactivation and c-Fos
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Rats progressively acquired the ability to stop
      cocaine seeking, even during drug intoxication and after a long history of
      cocaine self-administration. Inhibitory control of cocaine seeking was flexible, 
      sufficiently strong to block cocaine-primed reinstatement, and selectively
      depended on increased neuronal activity within the prelimbic PFC, which is
      considered the rodent functional homolog of the human lateral PFC. CONCLUSIONS:
      Parallel evidence in both animal models and humans indicate that recruitment of
      prefrontal inhibitory control of drug seeking is still functional after prolonged
      cocaine use. Preclinical investigation of the mechanisms underlying this capacity
      may contribute to designing new behavioral and/or pharmacologic strategies to
      promote its use for the prevention of relapse in addiction.

AB  - Memory operations such as encoding and retrieval require the coordinated
      interplay of cortical regions with distinct functional contributions. The
      mechanistic nature of these interactions, however, remains unspecified. During
      the performance of a face memory task during fMRI scanning, we measured the
      magnitude (a measure of the strength of coupling between areas) and phase (a
      measure of the relative timing across areas) of coherence between regions of
      interest and the rest of the brain. The fusiform face area (FFA) showed robust
      coherence with a distributed network of subregions in the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), precuneus, and hippocampus across both
      memory operations. While these findings reveal significant overlap in the
      cortical networks underlying mnemonic encoding and retrieval, coherence phase
      analyses revealed context-dependent differences in cortical dynamics. During both
      encoding and retrieval, PFC and PPC exhibited earlier activity than in the FFA
      and hippocampus. Also, during retrieval, PFC activity preceded PPC activity.
      These findings are consistent with prior physiology studies suggesting an early
      contribution of PFC and PPC in mnemonic control. Together, these findings
      contribute to the growing literature exploring the spatio-temporal dynamics of
      basic memory operations.

LID - 10.1098/rstb.2011.0417 [doi]
AB  - Ability in various cognitive domains is often assessed by measuring task
      performance, such as the accuracy of a perceptual categorization. A similar
      analysis can be applied to metacognitive reports about a task to quantify the
      degree to which an individual is aware of his or her success or failure. Here, we
      review the psychological and neural underpinnings of metacognitive accuracy,
      drawing on research in memory and decision-making. These data show that
      metacognitive accuracy is dissociable from task performance and varies across
      individuals. Convergent evidence indicates that the function of the rostral and
      dorsal aspect of the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) is important for the
      accuracy of retrospective judgements of performance. In contrast, prospective
      judgements of performance may depend upon medial PFC. We close with a discussion 
      of how metacognitive processes relate to concepts of cognitive control, and
      propose a neural synthesis in which dorsolateral and anterior prefrontal cortical
      subregions interact with interoceptive cortices (cingulate and insula) to promote
      accurate judgements of performance.

AB  - The P300 is a known ERP component assessing stimulus value, including the value
      of a monetary reward. In parallel, the incentive value of reinforcers relies on
      the PFC, a major cortical projection region of the mesocortical reward pathway.
      Here we show a significant positive correlation between P300 response to money
      (vs. no money) with PFC gray matter volume in the OFC, ACC, and dorsolateral and 
      ventrolateral PFC in healthy control participants. In contrast, individuals with 
      cocaine use disorders showed compromises in both P300 sensitivity to money and
      PFC gray matter volume in the ventrolateral PFC and OFC and their
      interdependence. These results document for the first time the importance of gray
      matter structural integrity of subregions of PFC to the reward-modulated P300
      response.

TI  - An analysis of rat prefrontal cortex in mediating executive function.
PG  - 417-31
LID - 10.1016/j.nlm.2011.07.002 [doi]
AB  - While it is acknowledged that species specific differences are an implicit
      condition of comparative studies, rodent models of prefrontal function serve a
      significant role in the acquisition of converging evidence on prefrontal function
      across levels of analysis and research techniques. The purpose of the present
      review is to examine whether the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in rats supports a
      variety of processes associated with executive function including working memory,
      temporal processing, planning (prospective coding), flexibility, rule learning,
      and decision making. Therefore, in this review we examined changes associated
      with working memory processes for spatial locations, visual objects, odors,
      tastes, and response domains or attributes, temporal processes including temporal
      order, sequence learning, prospective coding, behavioral flexibility associated
      with reversal learning and set shifting, paired associate learning, and decision 
      making based on effort, time discounting, and uncertainty following damage to the
      PFC in rats. In addition, potential parallel processes of executive function in
      monkeys and humans based on several theories of subregional differentiation
      within the PFC will be presented. Specifically, theories based on domain or
      attribute specificity (Goldman-Rakic, 1996), level of processing (Petrides,
      1996), rule learning based on complexity (Wise, Murray, & Gerfen, 1996),
      executive functions based on connectivity with other brain regions associated
      with top-down control (Miller & Cohen, 2001), are presented and applied to PFC
      function in rats with the aim of understanding subregional specificity in the rat
      PFC. The data suggest that there is subregional specificity within the PFC of
      rats, monkey and humans and there are parallel cognitive functions of the
      different subregions of the PFC in rats, monkeys and humans.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.1013287108 [doi]
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is assumed to contribute to goal-directed episodic
      encoding by exerting cognitive control on medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory
      processes. However, it is thus far unclear to what extent the contribution of
      PFC-MTL interactions to memory manifests at a structural anatomical level. We
      combined functional magnetic resonance imaging and fiber tracking based on
      diffusion tensor imaging in 28 young, healthy adults to quantify the density of
      white matter tracts between PFC regions that were activated during the encoding
      period of a verbal free-recall task and MTL subregions. Across the cohort, the
      strength of fiber bundles linking activated ventrolateral PFC regions and the
      rhinal cortex (comprising the peri- and entorhinal cortices) of the MTL
      correlated positively with free-recall performance. These direct white matter
      connections provide a basis through which activated regions in the PFC can
      interact with the MTL and contribute to interindividual differences in human
      episodic memory.

TI  - A gateway system in rostral PFC? Evidence from biasing attention to perceptual
      information and internal representations.
PG  - 1666-76
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.056 [doi]
AB  - Some situations require us to be highly sensitive to information in the
      environment, whereas in other situations, our attention is mainly focused on
      internally represented information. It has been hypothesized that a control
      system located in the rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC) acts as gateway between
      these two forms of attention. Here, we examined the neural underpinnings of this 
      'gateway system' using fMRI and functional connectivity analysis. We designed
      different tasks, in which the demands for attending to external or internal
      information were manipulated, and tested 1) whether there is a functional
      specialization within the rostral PFC along a medial-lateral dimension, and 2)
      whether these subregions can influence attentional weighting processes by
      specifically interacting with other parts of the brain. Our results show that
      lateral aspects of the rostral PFC are preferentially activated when attention is
      directed to internal representations, whereas anterior medial aspects are
      activated when attention is directed to sensory events. Furthermore, the
      rostrolateral subregion was preferentially connected to regions in the prefrontal
      and parietal cortex during internal attending, whereas the rostromedial subregion
      was connected to the basal ganglia, thalamus, and sensory association cortices
      during external attending. Finally, both subregions interacted with another
      important prefrontal region involved in cognitive control, the inferior frontal
      junction, in a task-specific manner, depending on the current attentional
      demands. These findings suggest that the rostrolateral and rostromedial part of
      the anterior PFC have dissociable roles in attentional control, and that they
      might, as part of larger networks, be involved in dynamically adjusting the
      contribution of internal and external information to current cognition.

TI  - Improved modulation of rostrolateral prefrontal cortex using real-time fMRI
      training and meta-cognitive awareness.
PG  - 1298-305
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.12.016 [doi]
AB  - Recent real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) training studies have demonstrated that subjects 
      can achieve improved control over localized brain regions by using real-time
      feedback about the level of fMRI signal in these regions. It has remained
      unknown, however, whether subjects can gain control over anterior prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) regions that support some of the most complex forms of human
      thought. In this study, we used rt-fMRI training to examine whether subjects can 
      learn to regulate the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC), or the lateral
      part of the anterior PFC, by using a meta-cognitive awareness strategy. We show
      that individuals can achieve improved regulation over the level of fMRI signal in
      their RLPFC by turning attention towards or away from their own thoughts. The
      ability to achieve improved modulation was contingent on observing veridical
      real-time feedback about the level of RLPFC activity during training; a
      sham-feedback control group demonstrated no improvement in modulation ability and
      neither did control subjects who received no rt-fMRI feedback but underwent
      otherwise identical training. Prior to training, meta-cognitive awareness was
      associated with recruitment of anterior PFC subregions, including both RLPFC and 
      medial PFC, as well as a number of other midline and posterior cortical regions. 
      Following training, however, regulation improvement was specific to RLPFC and was
      not observed in other frontal, midline, or parietal cortical regions. These
      results demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring control over high-level

TI  - Prefrontal cortex and drug abuse vulnerability: translation to prevention and
      treatment interventions.
PG  - 124-49
LID - 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2010.09.001 [doi]
AB  - Vulnerability to drug abuse is related to both reward seeking and impulsivity,
      two constructs thought to have a biological basis in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
      This review addresses similarities and differences in neuroanatomy,
      neurochemistry and behavior associated with PFC function in rodents and humans.
      Emphasis is placed on monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitter systems located
      in anatomically distinct subregions: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); lateral
      prefrontal cortex (lPFC); anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); and orbitofrontal
      cortex (OFC). While there are complex interconnections and overlapping functions 
      among these regions, each is thought to be involved in various functions related 
      to health-related risk behaviors and drug abuse vulnerability. Among the various 
      functions implicated, evidence suggests that mPFC is involved in reward
      processing, attention and drug reinstatement; lPFC is involved in
      decision-making, behavioral inhibition and attentional gating; ACC is involved in
      attention, emotional processing and self-monitoring; and OFC is involved in
      behavioral inhibition, signaling of expected outcomes and reward/punishment
      sensitivity. Individual differences (e.g., age and sex) influence functioning of 
      these regions, which, in turn, impacts drug abuse vulnerability. Implications for
      the development of drug abuse prevention and treatment strategies aimed at
      engaging PFC inhibitory processes that may reduce risk-related behaviors are
      discussed, including the design of effective public service announcements,
      cognitive exercises, physical activity, direct current stimulation, feedback
      control training and pharmacotherapies. A major challenge in drug abuse
      prevention and treatment rests with improving intervention strategies aimed at
      strengthening PFC inhibitory systems among at-risk individuals.

TI  - Separable prefrontal cortex contributions to free recall.
PG  - 10967-76
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2611-10.2010 [doi]
AB  - In everyday life, we often must remember the past in the absence of helpful cues 
      in the environment. In these cases, the brain directs retrieval by relying on
      internally maintained cues and strategies. Free recall is a widely used
      behavioral paradigm for studying retrieval with minimal cue support. During free 
      recall, individuals often recall semantically related items consecutively--an
      effect termed semantic clustering--and previous studies have sought to understand
      clustering to gain leverage on the basic mechanisms supporting strategic recall. 
      Successful recall and semantic clustering depend on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). 
      However, as a result of methodological limitations, few functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have assessed the neural mechanisms at encoding 
      that support subsequent recall, and none have tested the event-related correlates
      of recall itself. Thus, it remains open whether one or several frontal control
      mechanisms operate during encoding and recall. Here, we applied a recently
      developed method (Oztekin et al., 2010) to assess event-related fMRI signal
      changes during free recall. During encoding, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) activation was predictive of subsequent semantic clustering. In contrast,
      subregions of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) were predictive of
      subsequent recall, whether clustered or nonclustered, and were inversely
      associated with clustering during recall. These results suggest that DLPFC
      supports relational processes at encoding that are sufficient to produce category
      clustering effects during recall. Conversely, controlled retrieval mechanisms
      supported by VLPFC support item-specific search during recall.

TI  - Specialization of the rostral prefrontal cortex for distinct analogy processes.
PG  - 2647-59
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhq012 [doi]
AB  - Analogical reasoning is central to learning and abstract thinking. It involves
      using a more familiar situation (source) to make inferences about a less familiar
      situation (target). According to the predominant cognitive models, analogical
      reasoning includes 1) generation of structured mental representations and 2)
      mapping based on structural similarities between them. This study used functional
      magnetic resonance imaging to specify the role of rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      in these distinct processes. An experimental paradigm was designed that enabled
      differentiation between these processes, by temporal separation of the
      presentation of the source and the target. Within rostral PFC, a lateral
      subregion was activated by analogy task both during study of the source (before
      the source could be compared with a target) and when the target appeared. This
      may suggest that this subregion supports fundamental analogy processes such as
      generating structured representations of stimuli but is not specific to one
      particular processing stage. By contrast, a dorsomedial subregion of rostral PFC 
      showed an interaction between task (analogy vs. control) and period (more
      activated when the target appeared). We propose that this region is involved in
      comparison or mapping processes. These results add to the growing evidence for
      functional differentiation between rostral PFC subregions.

TI  - Prefrontal organization of cognitive control according to levels of abstraction.
PG  - 94-105
LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2009.05.096 [doi]
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a crucial role in cognitive control and higher 
      mental functions by maintaining working memory representations of currently
      relevant information, thereby inducing a mindset that facilitates the processing 
      of such information. Using fMRI, we examined how the human PFC implements
      mindsets for information at varying levels of abstraction. Subjects solved
      anagrams grouped into three kinds of blocks (concrete, moderately abstract, and
      highly abstract) according to the degree of abstraction of their solutions.
      Mindsets were induced by cuing subjects at the beginning of every block as to the
      degree of abstraction of solutions they should look for. Different levels of
      abstraction were matched for accuracy and reaction time, allowing us to examine
      the effects of varying abstraction in the absence of variations in cognitive
      complexity. Mindsets for concrete, moderately abstract, and highly abstract
      information were associated with stronger relative recruitment of ventrolateral, 
      dorsolateral, and rostrolateral PFC regions, respectively, suggesting a
      functional topography whereby increasingly anterior regions are preferentially
      associated with representations of increasing abstraction. Rather than being a
      structural property of the neurons in different prefrontal subregions, this
      relative specialization may reflect one of the principles according to which
      lateral PFC adaptively codes and organizes task-relevant information.

TI  - Dynamic neural responses to cue-reactivity paradigms in heroin-dependent users:
      an fMRI study.
PG  - 766-75
LID - 10.1002/hbm.20542 [doi]
AB  - Neuroimaging methods have been employed to study cue-reactivity-induced neural
      correlates in the human brain. However, very few studies have focused on
      characterizing the dynamic neural responses to the factorial interactions between
      the cues and the subjects. Fifteen right-handed heroin-dependent subjects and 12 
      age-matched nondrug using subjects participated in this study. Cue-reactivity
      paradigms were employed, while changes in blood oxygenation level-dependent
      (BOLD) signals were acquired by functional MRI (fMRI). The fMRI datasets were
      analyzed with AFNI software and repeated two-way ANOVA was employed for factorial
      analyses. Neural correlates of factorial interactions between cue-factor and
      subject-factor were identified in the regions of the ventral tegmental area
      (VTA), the left and right amygdala, the left and right fusiform cortex, and the
      precuneus in the mesocorticolimbic system, and in the superior frontal, dorsal
      lateral prefrontal, and orbitofrontal cortices in the prefrontal cortex system.
      The neural response patterns in the prefrontal systems are dynamic: decreased
      response to neutral-cues and increased response to heroin-cues. Further,
      heroin-cue-induced neural responses within the subregions in the PFC system are
      significantly intercorrelated. In conclusion, the cue-reactivity paradigms
      significantly activated the dynamic neural activations in the prefrontal system. 
      It is suggested that the dynamic response patterns in the PFC system characterize
      the impaired brain control functions in heroin-dependent subjects.

TI  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging evidence for a hierarchical organization of
      the prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 2082-99
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is central to flexible and organized action. Recent
      theoretical and empirical results suggest that the rostro-caudal axis of the
      frontal lobes may reflect a hierarchical organization of control. Here, we test
      whether the rostro-caudal axis of the PFC is organized hierarchically, based on
      the level of abstraction at which multiple representations compete to guide
      selection of action. Four functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      experiments parametrically manipulated the set of task-relevant (a) responses,
      (b) features, (c) dimensions, and (d) overlapping cue-to-dimension mappings. A
      systematic posterior to anterior gradient was evident within the PFC depending on
      the manipulated level of representation. Furthermore, across four fMRI
      experiments, activation in PFC subregions was consistent with the sub- and
      superordinate relationships that define an abstract representational hierarchy.
      In addition to providing further support for a representational hierarchy account
      of the rostro-caudal gradient in the PFC, these data provide important empirical 
      constraints on current theorizing about control hierarchies and the PFC.

TI  - Apathy and the basal ganglia.
PG  - VII54-61
AB  - We should like to emphasize the following points: 1. Apathy is defined here as a 
      quantified and observable behavioral syndrome consisting in a quantitative
      reduction of voluntary (or goal-directed) behaviors; 2. Therefore, apathy occurs 
      when the systems that generate and control voluntary actions are altered; 3.
      These systems are mostly represented by the different subregions embedded in the 
      Prefrontal cortex (PFC) and in the basal ganglia regions that are closely
      connected with the PFC; 4. In consequence, clinically, apathy is a prefrontal
      syndrome either due to direct lesions of the PFC or to lesions of basal ganglia
      areas that are closely related to the PFC; 5. Apathy is not a single entity but
      rather heterogeneous. Several different mechanisms may lead to apathy; Because
      there are several anatomical-functional prefrontal-basal ganglia circuits, the
      underlying mechanisms responsible for apathy may differ according to which
      prefrontal-basal ganglia circuit is affected; 6. In this context, apathy is the
      macroscopic results of the disruption of one or several elementary steps
      necessary for goal-directed behavior that are subserved by different
      prefrontal-basal ganglia circuits; 7. Intense apathy is related to caudate
      nucleus and GPi, disrupting associative and limbic pathways from/to the PFC; 8.
      in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and focal lesions (caudate nuclei, GPi), 
      apathy may be due to a loss of PFC activation; 9. In Parkinson's disease (PD),
      apathy may be due to a loss of signal focalization; 10. More globally, we propose
      that apathy may be explained by the impact of lesions or dysfunctions of the BG, 
      because these lesions or dysfunctions lead to a loss of amplification of the
      relevant signal and/or to a loss of temporal and spatial focalization, both of
      which result in a diminished extraction of the relevant signal within the frontal
      cortex, thereby inhibiting the capacity of the frontal cortex to select,
      initiate, maintain and shift programs of action.

TI  - Levels-of-processing effects in first-degree relatives of individuals with
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 1141-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: First-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia show
      cognitive impairments that are similar to but less severe than their ill
      relatives. We have shown that memory impairments can be improved and prefrontal
      cortical (PFC) activity increased in individuals with schizophrenia by providing 
      beneficial encoding strategies. The current study used a similar paradigm to
      determine whether siblings of individuals with schizophrenia (SIBs) also show
      increases in brain activity when presented with beneficial encoding strategies.
      METHODS: Twenty-one SIBs and 38 siblings of healthy comparison subjects underwent
      functional magnetic resonance imaging scans while engaged in deep
      (abstract/concrete judgments) and shallow (orthographic judgments) encoding.
      Subjects were then given a recognition memory test. RESULTS: The groups did not
      differ on encoding or recognition accuracy, and the SIBs benefited from deep
      encoding to a similar degree as control subjects. The SIBs showed deep
      encoding-related activity in a number of PFC regions typically activated during
      semantic processing. However, SIBs showed more activity than control subjects in 
      three subregions of PFC (left BA 44 & BA 47 bilaterally). CONCLUSIONS: Siblings
      of individuals with schizophrenia benefit from supportive verbal encoding
      conditions. Like individuals with schizophrenia, SIBs also show increased
      task-related activity in a larger number of PFC subregions than control subjects 
      during deep verbal encoding.

TI  - Organization of mnemonic and response operations within prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 133-41
AB  - There is mounting evidence that prefrontal cortex (PFC) is activated during
      mnemonic operations such as working memory maintenance and also during
      response-related operations. In the current study, we examine the neural
      organization of mnemonic and response operations with respect to each other
      within PFC. Stimulus-evoked and sustained functional MRI activity was recorded
      during performance of a mental calculation task. The presence or absence of
      mnemonic and response demands was manipulated in a 2 x 2 factorial design with
      conditions requiring: (1) memory encoding and maintenance (M+); (2) response
      selection and execution (R+); (3) encoding, maintenance, and response execution
      (M+R+); (4) neither mnemonic nor response-related processes (M-R-). The first
      step of the analyses identified PFC voxels exhibiting differential activity
      during (M+) vs. (R+) trials. Within these voxels, we then examined activity
      during multiple phases of (M+R+) trials. Greater stimulus-evoked and sustained
      activity was observed within the anterior extent of dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (BA 46) during R+ vs. M+ trials. In contrast, greater activity was
      observed in the posterior extent of dorsolateral PFC during M+ vs. R+ trials.
      Importantly, both regions were activated during (M+R+) trials. Activity levels
      during all of these conditions exceeded levels observed during (M-R-) control
      trials. These results suggest that integrative functions of PFC that allow past
      information to guide future actions may emerge from communication between
      discrete subregions supporting mnemonic and response operations.

TI  - Differential functions of lateral and medial rostral prefrontal cortex (area 10) 
      revealed by brain-behavior associations.
PG  - 1783-9
AB  - We analyzed the behavioral data from 104 neuroimaging studies using positron
      emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging that reported
      activation peaks in rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC), approximating Brodmann's
      area 10. The distribution of absolute x coordinates of activation peaks (i.e., x 
      coordinate regardless of hemisphere) differed significantly from a unimodal
      normal distribution, reflecting distinct clusters of activation in lateral and
      medial subregions. These 2 clusters were associated with different patterns of
      behavioral data. Lateral activations were associated with contrasts between
      experimental and control conditions where response times (RTs) were slower in the
      experimental condition. Medial activations were associated with contrasts where
      RTs were, if anything, faster in experimental than control conditions. These
      findings place important constraints on theories of rostral PFC functions.

TI  - Regional differences of the prefrontal cortex in pediatric PTSD: an MRI study.
PG  - 17-25
AB  - Previous studies have revealed altered structural development of the frontal
      lobes and prefrontal cortex (PFC) in children with symptoms of posttraumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD). This study is the first to provide a detailed structural 
      analysis of the PFC in children with and without PTSD symptoms. We compared gray 
      and white matter volume in four subregions of the PFC between said groups, then
      explored whether volume was associated with PTSD symptom severity and functional 
      impairment. PFC measurements were extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      data from a sample of 23 children (ages 7-14) with a history of trauma and
      symptoms of PTSD, who had undergone assessment for PTSD symptoms and functional
      impairment using the Child and Adolescent version of the Clinician-Administered
      PTSD Scale (CAPS-CA). These measurements were compared to data from an
      age-equivalent control group of 24 healthy children. Children with PTSD symptoms 
      showed a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the delineated
      middle-inferior and ventral regions of the PFC than did control children.
      Decreased volume of gray matter in the dorsal PFC correlated with increased
      functional impairment scores. Results indicate that increased volume of the
      middle-inferior and ventral PFC may be associated with trauma and PTSD symptoms
      in children. Furthermore, the neuroanatomy of the dorsal PFC may influence the
      degree of functional impairment experienced by children with PTSD symptoms.

PG  - 1042-51
AB  - Acquisition of odor-guided or visually-guided delayed win-shift behavior was
      evaluated in rats after lidocaine-induced inactivation within the agranular
      insular area of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) or the prelimbic area of the PFC.
      Additional sites and tasks were used to control for neuroanatomical and
      behavioral specificity of lidocaine inactivation of the agranular insular and
      prelimbic areas. Results showed that acquisition of the odor-guided delayed
      win-shift task was dependent on the agranular insular area, whereas acquisition
      of the visually-guided version was dependent on the prelimbic area. This
      dissociation suggests that the stimulus modality used is critical for revealing
      working memory functions of different PFC subregions. The described methods
      provide a complementary means to study working memory in PFC subregions using a
      radial-arm maze.

TI  - The contributions of lesion laterality and lesion volume to decision-making
      impairment following frontal lobe damage.
PG  - 1474-83
AB  - Lesions to prefrontal cortex (PFC) in humans can severely disrupt everyday
      decision-making, with concomitant effects on social and occupational functioning.
      Forty-six patients with unilateral lesions to prefrontal cortex and 21 healthy
      control subjects were administered three neuropsychological measures of
      decision-making: the Iowa Gambling Task, the Cambridge Gamble Task, and the Risk 
      Task. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 40 patients, with
      region of interest (ROI) mapping of prefrontal subregions. The frontal patients
      showed only limited damage in medial and orbital prefrontal cortex, but greater
      damage in lateral prefrontal regions of interest. Patients with right frontal
      lesions preferred the risky decks on the Iowa Gambling Task, and differed
      significantly from left frontal and control subjects. Within the right frontal
      group, the preference for the risky decks was correlated with the total lesion
      volume and the volume of damage outside of the ventromedial prefrontal region.
      Right and left frontal groups did not differ significantly on the Cambridge
      Gamble Task or the Risk Task, and performance was not associated with lesion
      volume. The results indicate a laterality effect on the Iowa Gambling Task, and
      the contribution of prefrontal regions outside the ventromedial region to task
      performance. The Cambridge Gamble Task and Risk Task were less sensitive to the
      effects of unilateral frontal lobe lesions, and may be more selectively
      associated with ventral prefrontal damage.

TI  - Prefrontal contributions to executive control: fMRI evidence for functional
      distinctions within lateral Prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 1337-47
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a fundamental role in internally guided
      behavior. Although it is generally accepted that PFC subserves working memory and
      executive control operations, it remains unclear whether the subregions within
      lateral PFC support distinct executive control processes. An event-related fMRI
      study was implemented to test the hypothesis that ventrolateral and dorsolateral 
      PFC are functionally distinct, as well as to assess whether functional
      specialization exists within ventrolateral PFC. Participants performed two
      executive control tasks that differed in the types of control processes required.
      During rote rehearsal, participants covertly rehearsed three words in the order
      presented, thus requiring phonological access and maintenance. During elaborative
      rehearsal, participants made semantic comparisons between three words held in
      working memory, reordering them from least to most desirable. Thus, in addition
      to maintenance, elaborative rehearsal required goal-relevant coding of items in
      working memory ("monitoring") and selection from among the items to implement
      their reordering. Results revealed that left posterior ventrolateral PFC was
      active during performance of both tasks, whereas right dorsolateral PFC was
      differentially engaged during elaborative rehearsal. The temporal characteristics
      of the hemodynamic responses further suggested that dorsolateral activation
      lagged ventrolateral activation. Finally, differential activation patterns were
      observed within left ventrolateral PFC, distinguishing between posterior and
      anterior regions. These data suggest that anatomically separable subregions
      within lateral PFC may be functionally distinct and are consistent with models
      that posit a hierarchical relationship between dorsolateral and ventrolateral
      regions such that the former monitors and selects goal-relevant representations
      being maintained by the latter.

TI  - Repeated amphetamine administration alters AMPA receptor subunit expression in
      rat nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 119-31
AB  - Glutamate is critical for the induction and maintenance of behavioral
      sensitization and associated neuroadaptations in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine
      (DA) system. We have shown previously [Lu et al. (1997) Synapse 26:269-280] that 
      repeated amphetamine administration alters AMPA receptor subunit mRNA levels in
      rat nucleus accumbens (NAc) and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC). The present study
      determined if amphetamine elicits corresponding changes in AMPA receptor subunit 
      immunolabeling. Rats were injected with amphetamine sulphate (5 mg/kg/day) or
      saline for 5 days and perfused 3 or 14 days after the last injection. AMPA
      receptor subunit immunolabeling was quantified using autoradiographic
      immunocytochemistry. In the NAc, GluR1 and GluR2 immunolabeling were unchanged
      after 3 days of withdrawal, but both were decreased significantly after 14 days
      of withdrawal (GluR1, 85.5+/-2.6% of control group, P<0.01; GluR2, 79.2+/-3.2%,
      P<0.01). Analysis of core and shell subregions at the 14-day withdrawal time
      indicated that GluR1 immunolabeling decreased significantly in shell, while GluR2
      immunolabeling decreased significantly in both core and shell. No changes in
      GluR2/3, GluR2/4, or GluR4 immunolabeling in NAc were found at either withdrawal 
      time. In the PFC, GluR1 immunolabeling increased after 3 days of withdrawal
      (115.3+/-7.0%, P<0.01) but returned to control levels after 14 days. The present 
      results correspond well with our previous findings at the mRNA level. These
      alterations in AMPA receptor expression may account for previously described
      changes in the electrophysiological responsiveness of NAc and PFC neurons to
      glutamate and AMPA. Along with alterations in DA function, they may contribute to
      drug-induced dysregulation of reward-related neurotransmission.

TI  - Genetic control of specific immune suppression. III. Mapping of H-2 complex
      complementing genes controlling immune suppression by the random copolymer
      L-glutamic acid50-L-tyrosine50 (GT).
PG  - 272-6
AB  - Earlier studies from our laboratory demonstrated that the terpolymer of
      L-glutamic acid, L-alanine, and L-tyrpsine (GAT) stimulated the development of T 
      cells capable of specifically suppressing the antibody responses in vivo and in
      vitro of nonresponder strains (bearing the H-2(s), H-2(q), and H-2(p) haplotypes)
      to GAT complexed with an immunogenic carrier, methylated bovine serum albumin,
      MBSA (1,2). We then extended these findings to another antigen, the copolymer of 
      L-glutamic acid and L-tyrosine (GT). None of 19 inbred or congenic resistant
      mouse strains developed antibody responses to GT after immunization with this
      synthetic polypeptide in adjuvants. All the strains investigated, however,
      developed IgG plaque-forming cells (PFC) primary responses to GT complexed with
      MBSA (3). This permitted us to determine that: (a) preimmunization with GT
      suppressed the response to GT-MBSA in certain but not in all strains; (b) the
      suppression could be transferred by thymocytes and spleen cells from GT-primed
      animals; (c) the development of GT-specific suppressor cells is under dominant
      control of H-2- linked gene(s) which have been designated specific immune
      suppressor genes (Is genes); (d) the Is genes are antigen specific since GAT-MBSA
      responses are suppressed by GAT in strains carrying the H-2(q) haplotype, while
      GT-MBSA responses are not suppressed by the related polymer GT in these same
      strains (3,4). The experiments reported in this study map the Is genes
      responsible for GT-specific suppression within the H-2 complex. The data indicate
      that the K and D loci are not concerned with GT-specific suppression, and that
      this phenomenon is controlled by complementing or interacting genes which map on 
      either side of cross-over events between the IB and IC subregions.
