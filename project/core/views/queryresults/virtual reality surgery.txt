TI  - Guidance value of intracranial venous circulation evaluation to parasagittal
      meningioma operation.
PG  - 13508-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is to investigate the value of intracranial venous
      circulation evaluation in guiding the surgery for parasagittal meningioma.
      METHODS: A total of 44 parasagittal meningioma (PSM) patients received 3D CE-MRV 
      scanning. The obtained images were reconstructed by virtual reality (VR)
      technology. Venous collateral circulation was evaluated. Postoperative follow-up 
      was carried out. RESULTS: Among 44 PSM patients, 41 cases were with resection of 
      Simpson grade I/II (93.18%) and 6 cases were with permanent neurological
      dysfunction (13.64%). Venous sinus thrombosis occurred in the remaining 3
      patients (6.82%), with 2 cases cured and 1 case died. The mortality rate was
      2.27%. Recurrence occurred in one case (2.27%) after discharge. In 9 cases, tumor
      adjacent SSS was transected and the poor prognosis rate was 33.33%. SSS was
      opened in 3 cases and after removal of the tumor the broken end was sutured
      directly. The poor prognosis occurred in one case (33.33%). Electrocoagulation
      was carried out to the SSS wall in 32 cases without opening venous sinus and 2
      cases were with poor prognosis (6.25%). The three different venous sinus
      treatment methods had no significantly difference on the prognosis of patients (P
      > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative evaluation of intracranial venous circulation 
      with VR technology and 3D CE-MRV may help making individual surgical plans,
      reduce venous injury and improve the prognosis of PSM patients.

TI  - Effectiveness of a Novel Augmented Reality-Based Navigation System in Treatment
      of Orbital Hypertelorism.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Augmented reality (AR) technology can superimpose the virtual image
      generated by computer onto the real operating field to present an integral image 
      to enhance surgical safety. The purpose of our study is to develop a novel
      AR-based navigation system for craniofacial surgery. We focus on orbital
      hypertelorism correction, because the surgery requires high preciseness and is
      considered tough even for senior craniofacial surgeon. METHODS: Twelve patients
      with orbital hypertelorism were selected. The preoperative computed tomography
      data were imported into 3-dimensional platform for preoperational design. The
      position and orientation of virtual information and real world were adjusted by
      image registration process. The AR toolkits were used to realize the integral
      image. Afterward, computed tomography was also performed after operation for
      comparing the difference between preoperational plan and actual operational
      outcome. RESULTS: Our AR-based navigation system was successfully used in these
      patients, directly displaying 3-dimensional navigational information onto the
      surgical field. They all achieved a better appearance by the guidance of
      navigation image. The difference in interdacryon distance and the dacryon point
      of each side appear no significant (P > 0.05) between preoperational plan and
      actual surgical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports on an effective
      visualized approach for guiding orbital hypertelorism correction. Our AR-based
      navigation system may lay a foundation for craniofacial surgery navigation. The
      AR technology could be considered as a helpful tool for precise osteotomy in
      craniofacial surgery.

AB  - A distorted body representation is a core symptom in eating disorders (EDs),
      though its mechanism is unclear. Allocentric lock theory, emphasising the role of
      reference frame processing in body image, suggests that ED patients may be
      (b)locked to an (allocentric) representation of their own body stored in
      long-term memory (e.g., my body is fat) that is not updated (modified) by the
      (real-time egocentric) perception-driven experience of the physical body.
      Employing a well-validated virtual reality-based procedure, relative to healthy
      controls, ED patients showed deficits in the ability to refer to and update a
      long-term stored (allocentric) representation with (egocentric) perceptual-driven
      inputs.

TI  - Virtual reality robotic surgery simulation curriculum to teach robotic suturing: 
      a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 179-86
LID - 10.1007/s11701-015-0513-4 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this randomized, controlled trial was to assess whether
      voluntary participation in a proctored, proficiency-based, virtual reality
      robotic suturing curriculum using the da Vinci((R)) Skills Simulator improves
      robotic suturing performance. Residents and attending surgeons were randomized to
      participation or non-participation during a 5 week training curriculum. Robotic
      suturing skills were evaluated before and after training using an inanimate
      vaginal cuff model, which participants sutured for 10 min using the da Vinci((R))
      Surgical System. Performances were videotaped, anonymized, and subsequently
      graded independently by three robotic surgeons. 27 participants were randomized. 
      23 of the 27 completed both the pre- and post-test, 13 in the training group and 
      10 in the control group. Mean training time in the intervention group was 238 +/-
      136 min (SD) over the 5 weeks. The primary outcome (improvement in GOALS+ score) 
      and the secondary outcomes (improvement in GEARS, total knots, satisfactory
      knots, and the virtual reality suture sponge 1 task) were significantly greater
      in the training group than the control group in unadjusted analysis. After
      adjusting for lower baseline scores in the training group, improvement in the
      suture sponge 1 task remained significantly greater in the training group and a
      trend was demonstrated to greater improvement in the training group for the
      GOALS+ score, GEARS score, total knots, and satisfactory knots.

TI  - Virtual Reality Body Swapping: A Tool for Modifying the Allocentric Memory of the
      Body.
AB  - An increasing amount of evidence has shown that embodiment of a virtual body via 
      visuo-tactile stimulation can lead to an altered perception of body and object
      size. The current study aimed to investigate whether virtual reality (VR) body
      swapping can be an effective tool for modifying the enduring memory of the body. 
      The experimental sample included 21 female participants who were asked to
      estimate the width and circumference of different body parts before any kind of
      stimulation and after two types of body swapping illusions ("synchronous
      visuo-tactile stimulation" and "asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation").
      Findings revealed that after participants embodied a virtual body with a skinny
      belly (independently of the type of visuo-tactile stimulation), there was an
      update of the stored representation of the body: participants reported a decrease
      in the ratio between estimated and actual body measures for most of the body
      parts considered. Based on the Allocentric Lock Theory, these findings provide
      first evidence that VR body swapping is able to induce a change in the memory of 
      the body. This knowledge may be potentially useful for patients suffering from
      eating and weight disorders.

TI  - Laparoscopic simulation training in gynaecology: Current provision and staff
      attitudes - a cross-sectional survey.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - The objectives of this study were to explore current provision of laparoscopic
      simulation training, and to determine attitudes of trainers and trainees to the
      role of simulators in surgical training across the UK. An anonymous
      cross-sectional survey with cluster sampling was developed and circulated. All
      Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Training Programme
      Directors (TPD), College Tutors (RCT) and Trainee representatives (TR) across the
      UK were invited to participate. One hundred and ninety-six obstetricians and
      gynaecologists participated. Sixty-three percent of hospitals had at least one
      box trainer, and 14.6% had least one virtual-reality simulator. Only 9.3% and
      3.6% stated that trainees used a structured curriculum on box and virtual-reality
      simulators, respectively. Respondents working in a Large/Teaching hospital (p =
      0.008) were more likely to agree that simulators enhance surgical training.
      Eighty-nine percent agreed that simulators improve the quality of training, and
      should be mandatory or desirable for junior trainees. Consultants (p = 0.003) and
      respondents over 40 years (p = 0.011) were more likely to hold that a simulation 
      test should be undertaken before live operation. Our data demonstrated,
      therefore, that availability of laparoscopic simulators is inconsistent, with
      limited use of mandatory structured curricula. In contrast, both trainers and
      trainees recognise a need for greater use of laparoscopic simulation for surgical
      training.

TI  - Face and content validity of a virtual-reality simulator for myringotomy with
      tube placement.
PG  - 40
LID - 10.1186/s40463-015-0094-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myringotomy with tube insertion can be challenging for junior
      Otolaryngology residents as it is one of the first microscopic procedures they
      encounter. The Western myringotomy simulator was developed to allow trainees to
      practice microscope positioning, myringotomy, and tube placement. This
      virtual-reality simulator is viewed in stereoscopic 3D, and a haptic device is
      used to manipulate the digital ear model and surgical tools. OBJECTIVE: To assess
      the face and content validity of the Western myringotomy simulator. METHODS: The 
      myringotomy simulator was integrated with new modules to allow speculum
      placement, manipulation of an operative microscope, and insertion of the
      ventilation tube through a deformable tympanic membrane. A questionnaire was
      developed in consultation with instructing surgeons. Fourteen face validity
      questions focused on the anatomy of the ear, simulation of the operative
      microscope, appearance and movement of the surgical instruments, deformation and 
      cutting of the eardrum, and myringotomy tube insertion. Six content validity
      questions focused on training potential on surgical tasks such as speculum
      placement, microscope positioning, tool navigation, ear anatomy, myringotomy
      creation and tube insertion. A total of 12 participants from the Department of
      Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery were recruited for the study. Prior to
      completing the questionnaire, participants were oriented to the simulator and
      given unlimited time to practice until they were comfortable with all of its
      aspects. RESULTS: Responses to 12 of the 14 questions on face validity were
      predominantly positive. One issue of concern was with contact modeling related to
      tube insertion into the eardrum, and the second was with the movement of the
      blade and forceps. The former could be resolved by using a higher resolution
      digital model for the eardrum to improve contact localization. The latter could
      be resolved by using a higher fidelity haptic device. With regard to content
      validity, 64% of the responses were positive, 21% were neutral, and 15% were
      negative. CONCLUSIONS: The Western myringotomy simulator appears to have
      sufficient face and content validity. Further development with automated metrics 
      and skills transference testing is planned.

TI  - Cognitive Load in Mastoidectomy Skills Training: Virtual Reality Simulation and
      Traditional Dissection Compared.
LID - S1931-7204(15)00232-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jsurg.2015.09.010 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The cognitive load (CL) theoretical framework suggests that working
      memory is limited, which has implications for learning and skills acquisition.
      Complex learning situations such as surgical skills training can potentially
      induce a cognitive overload, inhibiting learning. This study aims to compare CL
      in traditional cadaveric dissection training and virtual reality (VR) simulation 
      training of mastoidectomy. DESIGN: A prospective, crossover study. Participants
      performed cadaveric dissection before VR simulation of the procedure or vice
      versa. CL was estimated by secondary-task reaction time testing at baseline and
      during the procedure in both training modalities. SETTING: The national Danish
      temporal bone course. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 40 novice otorhinolaryngology
      residents. RESULTS: Reaction time was increased by 20% in VR simulation training 
      and 55% in cadaveric dissection training of mastoidectomy compared with baseline 
      measurements. Traditional dissection training increased CL significantly more
      than VR simulation training (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: VR simulation training
      imposed a lower CL than traditional cadaveric dissection training of
      mastoidectomy. Learning complex surgical skills can be a challenge for the novice
      and mastoidectomy skills training could potentially be optimized by employing VR 
      simulation training first because of the lower CL. Traditional dissection
      training could then be used to supplement skills training after basic
      competencies have been acquired in the VR simulation.

TI  - Towards immersive virtual reality (iVR): a route to surgical expertise.
LID - 2 [pii]
AB  - Surgery is characterized by complex tasks performed in stressful environments. To
      enhance patient safety and reduce errors, surgeons must be trained in
      environments that mimic the actual clinical setting. Rasmussen's model of human
      behavior indicates that errors in surgical procedures may be skill-, rule-, or
      knowledge-based. While skill-based behavior and some rule-based behavior may be
      taught using box trainers and ex vivo or in vivo animal models, we posit that
      multimodal immersive virtual reality (iVR) that includes high-fidelity visual as 
      well as other sensory feedback in a seamless fashion provides the only means of
      achieving true surgical expertise by addressing all three levels of human
      behavior. While the field of virtual reality is not new, realization of the goals
      of complete immersion is challenging and has been recognized as a Grand Challenge
      by the National Academy of Engineering. Recent technological advances in both
      interface and computational hardware have generated significant enthusiasm in
      this field. In this paper, we discuss convergence of some of these technologies
      and possible evolution of the field in the near term.

TI  - Indocyanine Green Fluorescence for Free-Flap Perfusion Imaging Revisited:
      Advanced Decision Making by Virtual Perfusion Reality in Visionsense Fusion
      Imaging Angiography.
LID - 1553350615610651 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Near-infrared indocyanine green video angiography (ICG-NIR-VA) has
      been introduced for free-flap surgery and may provide intraoperative flap
      designing as well as postoperative monitoring. Nevertheless, the technique has
      not been established in clinical routine because of controversy over benefits.
      Improved technical features of the novel Visionsense ICG-NIR-VA surgery system
      are promising to revisit the field of application. It features a unique real-time
      fusion image of simultaneous NIR and white light visualization, with highlighted 
      perfusion, including a color-coded perfusion flow scale for optimized anatomical 
      understanding. METHODS: In a feasibility study, the Visionsense ICG-NIR-VA system
      was applied during 10 free-flap surgeries in 8 patients at our center.
      Indications included anterior lateral thigh (ALT) flap (n = 4), latissimus dorsi 
      muscle flap (n = 1), tensor fascia latae flap (n = 1), and two bilateral deep
      inferior epigastric artery perforator flaps (n = 4). The system was used
      intraoperatively and postoperatively to investigate its impact on surgical
      decision making and to observe perfusion patterns correlated to clinical
      monitoring. RESULTS: Visionsense ICG-NIR-VA aided assessing free-flap design and 
      perfusion patterns in all cases and correlated with clinical observations.
      Additional interventions were performed in 2 cases (22%). One venous anastomosis 
      was revised, and 1 flap was redesigned. Indicated by ICG-NIR-VA, 1 ALT flap
      developed partial flap necrosis (11%). CONCLUSIONS: The Visionsense ICG-NIR-VA
      system allowed a virtual view of flap perfusion anatomy by fusion imaging in
      real-time. The system improved decision making for flap design and surgical
      decisions. Clinical and ICG-NIR-VA parameters correlated. Its future
      implementation may aid in improving outcomes for free-flap surgery, but
      additional experience is needed to define its final role.

TI  - [Risk awareness and training for prevention of complications in minimally
      invasive surgery].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive surgery (MIC) requires surgeons to have a
      different set of skills and capabilities from that of open surgery. The indirect 
      camera view, lack of a three-dimensional view, restricted haptic feedback with
      lack of tissue feeling and difficult instrument coordination with fulcrum and
      pivoting effects result in an additional learning curve compared to open surgery.
      The prolonged learning curve leads to a higher risk of complications and special 
      awareness of these risks is therefore mandatory. Training of special laparoscopic
      skills outside the operating room is needed to optimize patient outcome and to
      minimize the ocurrence of complications related to the learning curve. RESULTS
      AND DISCUSSION: Training modalities for laparoscopic surgery include simple box
      trainers, computer simulation with virtual reality, the use of artificial and
      cadaver organs, as well as live animal models and cadaver training. These
      training modalities have been proven in studies to have a beneficial effect on
      the learning curve for acquisition of laparoscopic skills and for improving
      operative performance as well as avoidance of complications. Laparoscopic
      training is currently gaining a more and more important role for official
      education and accreditation purposes. In some countries the participation in
      laparoscopic training courses has become mandatory prior to participation in
      laparoscopic operations. Future research will include the optimization of
      multimodal training curricula, the development of individualized training
      approaches that allow both trainee and patient-specific preparation, as well as
      the use of novel devices to facilitate the collection and transfer of expertise
      between the generations and schools of surgeons.

TI  - A review of simulation platforms in surgery of the temporal bone.
LID - 10.1111/coa.12560 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgery of the temporal bone is a high-risk activity in an
      anatomically complex area. Simulation enables rehearsal of such surgery. The
      traditional simulation platform is the cadaveric temporal bone, but in recent
      years other simulation platforms have been created, including plastic and virtual
      reality platforms. OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: To undertake a review of simulation
      platforms for temporal bone surgery, specifically assessing their educational
      value in terms of validity and in enabling transition to surgery. TYPE OF REVIEW:
      Systematic qualitative review. SEARCH STRATEGY: Search of the Pubmed, CINAHL, BEI
      and ERIC databases. EVALUATION METHOD: Assessment of reported outcomes in terms
      of educational value. RESULTS: 49 articles were included, covering cadaveric,
      animal, plastic, and virtual simulation platforms. Cadaveric simulation is highly
      rated as an educational tool, but there may be a ceiling effect on educational
      outcomes after drilling 8-10 temporal bones. Animal models show significant
      anatomical variation from man. Plastic temporal bone models offer much potential,
      but at present lack sufficient anatomical or haptic validity. Similarly, virtual 
      reality platforms lack sufficient anatomical or haptic validity, but with
      technological improvements they are advancing rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: At present
      cadaveric simulation remains the best platform for training in temporal bone
      surgery. Technological advances enabling improved materials or modelling mean
      that in the future plastic or virtual platforms may become comparable to
      cadaveric platforms, and also offer additional functionality including
      patient-specific simulation from CT data. This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - The effect of self-directed virtual reality simulation on dissection training
      performance in mastoidectomy.
LID - 10.1002/lary.25710 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To establish the effect of self-directed virtual reality
      (VR) simulation training on cadaveric dissection training performance in
      mastoidectomy and the transferability of skills acquired in VR simulation
      training to the cadaveric dissection training setting. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective 
      study. METHODS: Two cohorts of 20 novice otorhinolaryngology residents received
      either self-directed VR simulation training before cadaveric dissection training 
      or vice versa. Cadaveric and VR simulation performances were assessed using
      final-product analysis with three blinded expert raters. RESULTS: The group
      receiving VR simulation training before cadaveric dissection had a mean
      final-product score of 14.9 (95 % confidence interval [CI] [12.9-16.9]) compared 
      with 9.8 (95% CI [8.4-11.1]) in the group not receiving VR simulation training
      before cadaveric dissection. This 52% increase in performance was statistically
      significantly (P < 0.0001). A single dissection mastoidectomy did not increase VR
      simulation performance (P = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Two hours of self-directed VR
      simulation training was effective in increasing cadaveric dissection
      mastoidectomy performance and suggests that mastoidectomy skills are transferable
      from VR simulation to the traditional dissection setting. Virtual reality
      simulation training can therefore be employed to optimize training, and can spare
      the use of donated material and instructional resources for more advanced
      training after basic competencies have been acquired in the VR simulation
      environment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA. Laryngoscope, 2015.

TI  - The role of simulation in neurosurgery.
AB  - PURPOSE: In an era of residency duty-hour restrictions, there has been a recent
      effort to implement simulation-based training methods in neurosurgery teaching
      institutions. Several surgical simulators have been developed, ranging from
      physical models to sophisticated virtual reality systems. To date, there is a
      paucity of information describing the clinical benefits of existing simulators
      and the assessment strategies to help implement them into neurosurgical
      curricula. Here, we present a systematic review of the current models of
      simulation and discuss the state-of-the-art and future directions for simulation 
      in neurosurgery. METHODS: Retrospective literature review. RESULTS: Multiple
      simulators have been developed for neurosurgical training, including those for
      minimally invasive procedures, vascular, skull base, pediatric, tumor resection, 
      functional neurosurgery, and spine surgery. The pros and cons of existing systems
      are reviewed. CONCLUSION: Advances in imaging and computer technology have led to
      the development of different simulation models to complement traditional surgical
      training. Sophisticated virtual reality (VR) simulators with haptic feedback and 
      impressive imaging technology have provided novel options for training in
      neurosurgery. Breakthrough training simulation using 3D printing technology holds
      promise for future simulation practice, proving high-fidelity patient-specific
      models to complement residency surgical learning.

LID - 10.1016/j.eururo.2015.09.021 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: No single large published randomized controlled trial (RCT) has
      confirmed the efficacy of virtual simulators in the acquisition of skills to the 
      standard required for safe clinical robotic surgery. This remains the main
      obstacle for the adoption of these virtual simulators in surgical residency
      curricula. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the level of evidence in published studies on
      the efficacy of training on virtual simulators for robotic surgery. EVIDENCE
      ACQUISITION: In April 2015 a literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of
      Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, the Clinical Trials Database (US) and the Meta
      Register of Controlled Trials. All publications were scrutinized for relevance to
      the review and for assessment of the levels of evidence provided using the
      classification developed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.
      EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The publications included in the review consisted of one RCT 
      and 28 cohort studies on validity, and seven RCTs and two cohort studies on
      skills transfer from virtual simulators to robot-assisted surgery. Simulators
      were rated good for realism (face validity) and for usefulness as a training tool
      (content validity). However, the studies included used various simulation
      training methodologies, limiting the assessment of construct validity. The review
      confirms the absence of any consensus on which tasks and metrics are the most
      effective for the da Vinci Skills Simulator and dV-Trainer, the most widely
      investigated systems. Although there is consensus for the RoSS simulator, this is
      based on only two studies on construct validity involving four exercises. One
      study on initial evaluation of an augmented reality module for partial
      nephrectomy using the dV-Trainer reported high correlation (r=0.8) between in
      vivo porcine nephrectomy and a virtual renorrhaphy task according to the overall 
      Global Evaluation Assessment of Robotic Surgery (GEARS) score. In one RCT on
      skills transfer, the experimental group outperformed the control group, with a
      significant difference in overall GEARS score (p=0.012) during performance of
      urethrovesical anastomosis on an inanimate model. Only one study included
      assessment of a surgical procedure on real patients: subjects trained on a
      virtual simulator outperformed the control group following traditional training. 
      However, besides the small numbers, this study was not randomized. CONCLUSIONS:
      There is an urgent need for a large, well-designed, preferably multicenter RCT to
      study the efficacy of virtual simulation for acquisition competence in and safe
      execution of clinical robotic-assisted surgery. PATIENT SUMMARY: We reviewed the 
      literature on virtual simulators for robot-assisted surgery. Validity studies
      used various simulation training methodologies. It is not clear which exercises
      and metrics are the most effective in distinguishing different levels of
      experience on the da Vinci robot. There is no reported evidence of skills
      transfer from simulation to clinical surgery on real patients.

LID - 10.4240/wjgs.v7.i9.185 [doi]
AB  - The dissemination of laparoscopic colorectal surgery (LCS) has been slow despite 
      increasing evidence for the clinical benefits, with a prolonged learning curve
      being one of the main restrictions for a prompt uptake. Performing advanced
      laparoscopic procedures requires dedicated surgical skills and new simulation
      methods designed precisely for LCS have been established: These include virtual
      reality simulators, box trainers, animal and human tissue and synthetic
      materials. Studies have even demonstrated an improvement in trainees'
      laparoscopic skills in the actual operating room and a staged approach to
      surgical simulation with a combination of various training methods should be
      mandatory in every colorectal training program. The learning curve for LCS could 
      be reduced through practice and skills development in a riskfree setting.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review to
      determine the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) training in orthopaedic
      surgery. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic review was performed of articles of 
      VR training in orthopaedic surgery published up to November 2014 from MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases.
      RESULTS: We included 10 relevant trials of 91 identified articles, which all
      reported on training in arthroscopic surgery (shoulder, n = 5; knee, n = 4;
      undefined, n = 1). A total of 303 participants were involved. Assessment after
      training was made on a simulator in 9 of the 10 studies, and in one study it took
      place in the operating room (OR) on a real patient. A total of 32 different
      outcomes were extracted; 29 of them were about skills assessment. None involved a
      patient-related outcome. One study focused on anatomic learning, and the other
      evaluated technical task performance before and after training on a VR simulator.
      Five studies established construct validity. Three studies reported a
      statistically significant improvement in technical skills after training on a VR 
      simulator. CONCLUSIONS: VR training leads to an improvement of technical skills
      in orthopaedic surgery. Before its widespread use, additional trials are needed
      to clarify the transfer of VR training to the OR. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Systematic
      review of Level I through Level IV studies.

TI  - Face, Content, and Construct Validity of Brain Tumor Microsurgery Simulation
      Using a Human Placenta Model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain tumors are complex 3-dimensional lesions. Their resection
      involves training and the use of the multiple microsurgical techniques available 
      for removal. Simulation models, with haptic and visual realism, may be useful for
      improving the bimanual technical skills of neurosurgical residents and
      neurosurgeons, potentially decreasing surgical errors and thus improving patient 
      outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe and assess an ex vivo placental model for brain 
      tumor microsurgery using a simulation tool in neurosurgical psychomotor teaching 
      and assessment. METHODS: Sixteen human placentas were used in this research
      project. Intravascular blood remnants were removed by continuous saline solution 
      irrigation of the 2 placental arteries and placental vein. Brain tumors were
      simulated using silicone injections in the placental stroma. Eight neurosurgeons 
      and 8 neurosurgical residents carried out the resection of simulated tumors using
      the same surgical instruments and bimanual microsurgical techniques used to
      perform human brain tumor operations. Face and content validity was assessed
      using a subjective evaluation based on a 5-point Likert scale. Construct validity
      was assessed by analyzing the surgical performance of the neurosurgeon and
      resident groups. RESULTS: The placenta model simulated brain tumor surgical
      procedures with high fidelity. Results showed face and content validity.
      Construct validity was demonstrated by statistically different surgical
      performances among the evaluated groups. CONCLUSION: Human placentas are useful
      haptic models to simulate brain tumor microsurgical removal. Results using this
      model demonstrate face, content, and construct validity. ABBREVIATION: VR,
      virtual reality.

PG  - 1091-6
LID - 10.1017/S0022215115002364 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality surgical simulation of mastoidectomy is a promising
      training tool for novices. Final-product analysis for assessing novice
      mastoidectomy performance could be limited by a peak or ceiling effect. These may
      be countered by simulator-integrated tutoring. METHODS: Twenty-two participants
      completed a single session of self-directed practice of the mastoidectomy
      procedure in a virtual reality simulator. Participants were randomised for
      additional simulator-integrated tutoring. Performances were assessed at 10-minute
      intervals using final-product analysis. RESULTS: In all, 45.5 per cent of
      participants peaked before the 60-minute time limit. None of the participants
      achieved the maximum score, suggesting a ceiling effect. The tutored group
      performed better than the non-tutored group but tutoring did not eliminate the
      peak or ceiling effects. CONCLUSION: Timing and adequate instruction is important
      when using final-product analysis to assess novice mastoidectomy performance.
      Improved real-time feedback and tutoring could address the limitations of final
      product based assessment.

TI  - Virtual reality training for improving the skills needed for performing surgery
      of the ear, nose or throat.
PG  - CD010198
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010198.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality simulation uses computer-generated imagery to present
      a simulated training environment for learners. This review seeks to examine
      whether there is evidence to support the introduction of virtual reality surgical
      simulation into ear, nose and throat surgical training programmes. OBJECTIVES: 1.
      To assess whether surgeons undertaking virtual reality simulation-based training 
      achieve surgical ('patient') outcomes that are at least as good as, or better
      than, those achieved through conventional training methods.2. To assess whether
      there is evidence from either the operating theatre, or from controlled
      (simulation centre-based) environments, that virtual reality-based surgical
      training leads to surgical skills that are comparable to, or better than, those
      achieved through conventional training. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Ear, Nose
      and Throat Disorders Group (CENTDG) Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the
      CENTDG Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015,
      Issue 6); PubMed; EMBASE; ERIC; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP
      and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the
      search was 27 July 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised
      controlled trials and controlled trials comparing virtual reality training and
      any other method of training in ear, nose or throat surgery. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane
      Collaboration. We evaluated both technical and non-technical aspects of skill
      competency. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine studies involving 210 participants.
      Out of these, four studies (involving 61 residents) assessed technical skills in 
      the operating theatre (primary outcomes). Five studies (comprising 149 residents 
      and medical students) assessed technical skills in controlled environments
      (secondary outcomes). The majority of the trials were at high risk of bias. We
      assessed the GRADE quality of evidence for most outcomes across studies as 'low'.
      Operating theatre environment (primary outcomes) In the operating theatre, there 
      were no studies that examined two of three primary outcomes: real world patient
      outcomes and acquisition of non-technical skills. The third primary outcome
      (technical skills in the operating theatre) was evaluated in two studies
      comparing virtual reality endoscopic sinus surgery training with conventional
      training. In one study, psychomotor skill (which relates to operative technique
      or the physical co-ordination associated with instrument handling) was assessed
      on a 10-point scale. A second study evaluated the procedural outcome of
      time-on-task. The virtual reality group performance was significantly better,
      with a better psychomotor score (mean difference (MD) 1.66, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.81; 
      10-point scale) and a shorter time taken to complete the operation (MD -5.50
      minutes, 95% CI -9.97 to -1.03). Controlled training environments (secondary
      outcomes) In a controlled environment five studies evaluated the technical skills
      of surgical trainees (one study) and medical students (three studies). One study 
      was excluded from the analysis. Surgical trainees: One study (80 participants)
      evaluated the technical performance of surgical trainees during temporal bone
      surgery, where the outcome was the quality of the final dissection. There was no 
      difference in the end-product scores between virtual reality and cadaveric
      temporal bone training. Medical students: Two other studies (40 participants)
      evaluated technical skills achieved by medical students in the temporal bone
      laboratory. Learners' knowledge of the flow of the operative procedure
      (procedural score) was better after virtual reality than conventional training
      (SMD 1.11, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.79). There was also a significant difference in
      end-product score between the virtual reality and conventional training groups
      (SMD 2.60, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.49). One study (17 participants) revealed that
      medical students acquired anatomical knowledge (on a scale of 0 to 10) better
      during virtual reality than during conventional training (MD 4.3, 95% CI 2.05 to 
      6.55). No studies in a controlled training environment assessed non-technical
      skills. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence to support the inclusion 
      of virtual reality surgical simulation into surgical training programmes, on the 
      basis that it can allow trainees to develop technical skills that are at least as
      good as those achieved through conventional training. Further investigations are 
      required to determine whether virtual reality training is associated with better 
      real world outcomes for patients and the development of non-technical skills.
      Virtual reality simulation may be considered as an additional learning tool for

TI  - Virtual Interactive Presence in Global Surgical Education: International
      Collaboration through Augmented Reality.

LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2015.08.053 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Technology allowing a remote, experienced surgeon to provide
      real-time guidance to local surgeons has great potential for training and
      capacity building in medical centers worldwide. Virtual interactive presence and 
      augmented reality (VIPAR), an iPad(R)-based tool, allows surgeons to provide
      long-distance virtual assistance wherever a wireless internet connection is
      available. Local and remote surgeons view a composite image of video feeds at
      each station, allowing for intraoperative telecollaboration in real time.
      METHODS: Local and remote stations were established in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam,
      and Birmingham, Alabama, as part of ongoing neurosurgical collaboration.
      Endoscopic third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus coagulation (ETV/CPC)
      utilizing VIPAR was used for subjective and objective evaluation of system
      performance. RESULTS: VIPAR allowed both surgeons to engage in complex visual and
      verbal communication during the procedure. Analysis of five video clips revealed 
      video delay of 237msec (range: 93-391msec) relative to the audio signal.
      Excellent image resolution allowed the remote neurosurgeon to visualize all
      critical anatomy. The remote neurosurgeon could gesture to structures with no
      detectable difference in accuracy between stations, allowing for sub-millimeter
      precision. Fifteen ETV/CPC procedures have been performed utilizing VIPAR between
      Vietnam and the United States, with no significant complications. 80% of these
      patients remain shunt-free. CONCLUSION: Evolving technologies allowing
      long-distance, intra-operative guidance and knowledge transfer hold great
      potential for highly efficient international neurosurgical education. VIPAR is
      one example of an inexpensive, scalable platform for increasing global
      neurosurgical capacity. Efforts to create a network of Vietnamese neurosurgeons
      using VIPAR for collaboration are underway.

TI  - Preoperative preparation for otologic surgery: temporal bone simulation.
PG  - 355-9
LID - 10.1097/MOO.0000000000000181 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The field of temporal bone simulation (TBS) has largely
      focused on the development and validation of simulators as training and
      assessment tools. As technology has progressed over the years, researchers have, 
      however, envisioned new clinical applications for simulators extending to
      preoperative surgical planning and case rehearsal. The purpose of this article
      was to review the current state of the art in TBS and to highlight recent
      advancements in the field. Because of space limitations, we will limit our
      discussion to computer-based virtual reality simulators. RECENT FINDINGS: A
      review of the recent literature on TBS revealed very limited application of
      virtual reality simulators for preoperative preparation. Current evidence
      suggests limitations in fidelity preclude successful patient-specific case
      rehearsal using virtual reality simulation. Further investigation and clinical
      evaluation are required to validate its use outside of training and skill
      assessment. SUMMARY: This article provides an overview of the current use of
      virtual reality simulators with emphasis on preoperative planning. We evaluate
      the limitations of the technology, and discuss potential areas of improvement for
      the future. More studies are necessary to assess the value of virtual reality
      simulation for preoperative preparation.

TI  - Learning Curves of Virtual Mastoidectomy in Distributed and Massed Practice.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1001/jamaoto.2015.1563 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Repeated and deliberate practice is crucial in surgical skills
      training, and virtual reality (VR) simulation can provide self-directed training 
      of basic surgical skills to meet the individual needs of the trainee. Assessment 
      of the learning curves of surgical procedures is pivotal in understanding skills 
      acquisition and best-practice implementation and organization of training.
      Objective: To explore the learning curves of VR simulation training of
      mastoidectomy and the effects of different practice sequences with the aim of
      proposing the optimal organization of training. Design, Setting, and
      Participants: A prospective trial with a 2 x 2 design was conducted at an
      academic teaching hospital. Participants included 43 novice medical students. Of 
      these, 21 students completed time-distributed practice from October 14 to
      November 29, 2013, and a separate group of 19 students completed massed practice 
      on May 16, 17, or 18, 2014. Data analysis was performed from June 6, 2014, to
      March 3, 2015. Interventions: Participants performed 12 repeated virtual
      mastoidectomies using a temporal bone surgical simulator in either a distributed 
      (practice blocks spaced in time) or massed (all practice in 1 day) training
      program with randomization for simulator-integrated tutoring during the first 5
      sessions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Performance was assessed using a modified
      Welling Scale for final product analysis by 2 blinded senior otologists. Results:
      Compared with the 19 students in the massed practice group, the 21 students in
      the distributed practice group were older (mean age, 25.1 years), more often male
      (15 [62%]), and had slightly higher mean gaming frequency (2.3 on a 1-5 Likert
      scale). Learning curves were established and distributed practice was found to be
      superior to massed practice, reported as mean end score (95% CI) of 15.7
      (14.4-17.0) in distributed practice vs 13.0 (11.9-14.1) with massed practice (P =
      .002). Simulator-integrated tutoring accelerated the initial performance, with
      mean score for tutored sessions of 14.6 (13.9-15.2) vs 13.4 (12.8-14.0) for
      corresponding nontutored sessions (P < .01) but at the cost of a drop in
      performance once tutoring ceased. The performance drop was less with distributed 
      practice, suggesting a protective effect when acquired skills were consolidated
      over time. The mean performance of the nontutored participants in the distributed
      practice group plateaued on a score of 16.0 (15.3-16.7) at approximately the
      ninth repetition, but the individual learning curves were highly variable.
      Conclusions and Relevance: Novices can acquire basic mastoidectomy competencies
      with self-directed VR simulation training. Training should be organized with
      distributed practice, and simulator-integrated tutoring can be useful to
      accelerate the initial learning curve. Practice should be deliberate and toward a
      standard set level of proficiency that remains to be defined rather than toward
      the mean learning curve plateau.

TI  - Current state of virtual reality simulation in robotic surgery training: a
      review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the annual number of robotic surgical procedures continues
      to increase. Robotic surgical skills are unique from those used in either open or
      laparoscopic surgery. The acquisition of a basic robotic surgical skill set may
      be best accomplished in the simulation laboratory. We sought to review the
      current literature pertaining to the use of virtual reality (VR) simulation in
      the acquisition of robotic surgical skills on the da Vinci Surgical System.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted between December 2014 and
      January 2015 utilizing the following keywords: virtual reality, robotic surgery, 
      da Vinci, da Vinci skills simulator, SimSurgery Educational Platform, Mimic
      dV-Trainer, and Robotic Surgery Simulator. Articles were included if they were
      published between 2007 and 2015, utilized VR simulation for the da Vinci Surgical
      System, and utilized a commercially available VR platform. RESULTS: The initial
      search criteria returned 227 published articles. After all inclusion and
      exclusion criteria were applied, a total of 47 peer-reviewed manuscripts were
      included in the final review. CONCLUSIONS: There are many benefits to utilizing
      VR simulation for robotic skills acquisition. Four commercially available
      simulators have been demonstrated to be capable of assessing robotic skill. Three
      of the four simulators demonstrate the ability of a VR training curriculum to
      improve basic robotic skills, with proficiency-based training being the most
      effective training style. The skills obtained on a VR training curriculum are
      comparable with those obtained on dry laboratory simulation. The future of VR
      simulation includes utilization in assessment for re-credentialing purposes,
      advanced procedural-based training, and as a warm-up tool prior to surgery.

TI  - [THE ROLE OF SIMULATION IN SURGICAL TRAINING--A NEW ERA].
PG  - 398-403
AB  - Surgical training, which was traditionally based on the apprentice model, is
      undergoing a fundamental change since the introduction of virtual reality
      simulators into the training program of surgical residents. With the introduction
      of these simulators we can expect to see an improvement in the surgical abilities
      of new surgeons and a decrease in costs--as seen in the aviation world. Virtual
      reality simulators include a visual and tactile interface which is meant to train
      young surgeons in full procedure before the actual surgery. The available
      operation encompasses a multitude of surgical disciplines--gynecology, urology,
      orthopedics, vascular surgery, general surgery and more. The simulator allows the
      surgeon to practice complicated procedures and to be exposed to emergency
      situations without risking the patient's life. We opened in the Carmel Medical
      Center a multi disciplinary simulation center 18 months ago. The center includes 
      simulators for gynecology, orthopedics, urology, general surgery, vascular
      surgery and advanced cardiac life support. The center cooperates with the Faculty
      of Medicine at the Technion in order to train young surgeons in all surgical
      disciplines. In this period of time we followed the improvement in the endoscopic
      abilities of the basic skills course participants.

AB  - In recent years, due to reduced training opportunities, the major shift in
      surgical training is towards the use of simulation and animal laboratories.
      Despite the merits of Virtual Reality Simulators, they are far from representing 
      the real challenges encountered in theatres. We introduce the "Cattle Uterus
      Model" in the hope that it will be adopted in training courses as a low cost and 
      easy-to-set-up tool. It adds new dimensions to the advanced hysteroscopic surgery
      training experience by providing tactile sensation and simulating intraoperative 
      difficulties. It complements conventional surgical training, aiming to maximise
      clinical exposure and minimise patients' harm.

AB  - Recognizing clinical style is essential for generating intelligent guidance in
      virtual reality simulators for dental skill acquisition. The aim of this study
      was to determine the potential of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in matching novices'
      tooth cutting sequences with those of experts. Forty dental students and four
      expert dentists were enrolled to perform access opening to the root canals with a
      simulator. Four experts performed in manners that differed widely in the tooth
      preparation sequence. Forty students were randomly allocated into four groups and
      were trained following each expert. DTW was performed between each student's
      sequence and all the expert sequences to determine the best match. Overall, the
      accuracy of the matching was high (95%). The current results suggest that the DTW
      is a useful technique to find the best matching expert for a student so that
      feedback based on that expert's performance can be given to the novice in
      clinical skill training.

TI  - Notes From the Field: Secondary Task Precision for Cognitive Load Estimation
      During Virtual Reality Surgical Simulation Training.
LID - 0163278715597962 [pii]
AB  - Cognitive load (CL) theory suggests that working memory can be overloaded in
      complex learning tasks such as surgical technical skills training, which can
      impair learning. Valid and feasible methods for estimating the CL in specific
      learning contexts are necessary before the efficacy of CL-lowering instructional 
      interventions can be established. This study aims to explore secondary task
      precision for the estimation of CL in virtual reality (VR) surgical simulation
      and also investigate the effects of CL-modifying factors such as
      simulator-integrated tutoring and repeated practice. Twenty-four participants
      were randomized for visual assistance by a simulator-integrated tutor function
      during the first 5 of 12 repeated mastoidectomy procedures on a VR temporal bone 
      simulator. Secondary task precision was found to be significantly lower during
      simulation compared with nonsimulation baseline, p < .001. Contrary to
      expectations, simulator-integrated tutoring and repeated practice did not have an
      impact on secondary task precision. This finding suggests that even though
      considerable changes in CL are reflected in secondary task precision, it lacks
      sensitivity. In contrast, secondary task reaction time could be more sensitive,
      but requires substantial postprocessing of data. Therefore, future studies on the
      effect of CL modifying interventions should weigh the pros and cons of the
      various secondary task measurements.

TI  - Virtual Reality in Health System: Beyond Entertainment. A Mini-Review on the
      Efficacy of VR During Cancer Treatment.
PG  - 275-87

AB  - Virtual reality (VR), a computer-generated virtual environment, has been
      increasingly used in the entertainment world becoming a very new evolving field, 
      but VR technology has also found a variety of applications in the biomedical
      field. VR can offer to subjects a safe environment within which to carry on
      different interventions ranging from the rehabilitation of discharged patients
      directly at home, to the support of hospitalized patients during different
      procedures and also of oncological inpatient subjects. VR appears as a promising 
      tool for support and monitoring treatments in cancer patients influencing
      psychological and physiological functions. The aim of this systematic review is
      to provide an overview of all the studies that used VR intervention on cancer
      patients and analyze their main findings. Nineteen studies across nearly a
      thousand articles were identified that explored effects of VR interventions on
      cancer patients. Although these studies varied greatly in setting and design,
      this review identified some overarching themes. Results found that VR improved
      patients' emotional well-being, and diminished cancer-related psychological
      symptoms. The studies explored various relevant variables including different
      types of settings (i.e., during chemotherapy, during pain procedures, during
      hospitalization). Here, we point to the need of a global and multi-disciplinary
      approach aimed at analyzing the effects of VR taking advantage of the new
      technology systems like biosensors as well as electroencephalogram monitoring
      pre, during, and after intervention. Devoting more attention to bio-physiological
      variables, standardized procedures, extending duration to longitudinal studies
      and adjusting for motion sickness related to VR treatment need to become standard
      of this research field. J. Cell. Physiol. 231: 275-287, 2016. (c) 2015 Wiley

TI  - Computer-assisted surgical planning and intraoperative guidance in fetal surgery:
      a systematic review.
LID - 10.1002/pd.4660 [doi]
AB  - Fetal surgery has become a clinical reality, with interventions for twin-to-twin 
      transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and spina bifida demonstrated to improve outcome.
      Fetal imaging is evolving, with the use of 3D ultrasound and fetal MRI becoming
      more common in clinical practise. Medical imaging analysis is also changing, with
      technology being developed to assist surgeons by creating 3D virtual models that 
      improve understanding of complex anatomy, and prove powerful tools in surgical
      planning and intraoperative guidance. We introduce the concept of
      computer-assisted surgical planning, and present the results of a systematic
      review of image reconstruction for fetal surgical planning that identified six
      articles using such technology. Indications from other specialities suggest a
      benefit of surgical planning and guidance to improve outcomes. There is therefore
      an urgent need to develop fetal-specific technology in order to improve fetal
      surgical outcome. (c) 2015 The Authors. Prenatal Diagnosis published by John

AB  - Gait variability measures have been linked to fall risk in older adults. However,
      challenging walking tasks may be required to elucidate increases in variability
      that arise from subtle age-related changes in cognitive processing and
      sensorimotor function. Hence, the study objective was to investigate the effects 
      of visual perturbations, increased cognitive load, and narrowed step width on
      gait variability in healthy old and young adults. Eleven old (OA, 71.2+/-4.2
      years) and twelve young (YA, 23.6+/-3.9 years) adults walked on a treadmill while
      watching a speed-matched virtual hallway. Subjects walked: (1) normally, (2) with
      mediolateral visual perturbations, (3) while performing a cognitive task (serial 
      seven subtractions), and (4) with narrowed step width. We computed the mean and
      variability of step width (SW and SWV, respectively) and length (SL, SLV) over
      one 3-min trial per condition. Walking normally, old and young adults exhibited
      similar SWV and SLV. Visual perturbations significantly increased gait
      variability in old adults (by more than 100% for both SWV and SLV), but not young
      adults. The cognitive task and walking with narrowed step width did not show any 
      effect on SWV or SLV in either group. The dramatic increase in step width
      variability when old adults were subjected to mediolateral visual perturbations
      was likely due to increased reliance on visual feedback for assessing whole-body 
      position. Further work is needed to ascertain whether these findings may reflect 
      sub-clinical balance deficits that could contribute to the increased fall risk
      seen with advancing age.

TI  - Designing a Standardized Laparoscopy Curriculum for Gynecology Residents: A
      Delphi Approach.
PG  - 197-202
LID - 10.4300/JGME-D-14-00548.1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that simulation leads to improved operative skill, 
      shorter operating room time, and better patient outcomes. Currently, no
      standardized laparoscopy curriculum exists for gynecology residents. OBJECTIVE:
      To design a structured laparoscopy curriculum for gynecology residents using
      Delphi consensus methodology. METHODS: This study began with Delphi methodology
      to determine expert consensus on the components of a gynecology laparoscopic
      skills curriculum. We generated a list of cognitive content, technical skills,
      and nontechnical skills for training in laparoscopic surgery, and asked 39
      experts in gynecologic education to rate the items on a Likert scale (1-5) for
      inclusion in the curriculum. Consensus was predefined as Cronbach alpha of
      >/=0.80. We then conducted another Delphi survey with 9 experienced users of
      laparoscopic virtual reality simulators to delineate relevant curricular tasks.
      Finally, a cross-sectional design defined benchmark scores for all identified
      tasks, with 10 experienced gynecologic surgeons performing the identified tasks
      at basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. RESULTS: Consensus (Cronbach
      alpha=0.85) was achieved in the first round of the curriculum Delphi, and after 2
      rounds (Cronbach alpha=0.80) in the virtual reality curriculum Delphi. Consensus 
      was reached for cognitive, technical, and nontechnical skills as well as for 6
      virtual reality tasks. Median time and economy of movement scores defined
      benchmarks for all tasks. CONCLUSIONS: This study used Delphi consensus to
      develop a comprehensive curriculum for teaching gynecologic laparoscopy. The
      curriculum conforms to current educational standards of proficiency-based
      training, and is suggested as a standard in residency programs.

LID - S1553-4650(15)00538-5 [pii]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To validate the Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer
      (VBLaST-PT; the peg transfer task) for concurrent validity based on its ability
      to differentiate between novice, intermediate, and expert groups of
      gynecologists, and the gynecologists' subjective preference between the physical 
      Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) system and the virtual reality system.
      DESIGN: Prospective study (Canadian Task Force II-2). SETTING: Academic medical
      center. PARTICIPANTS: Obstetrics and gynecology residents (n = 18) and attending 
      gynecologists (n = 9). INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-seven subjects were divided into 3
      groups: novices (n = 9), intermediates (n = 9), and experts (n = 9). All subjects
      performed 10 trials of the peg transfer on each simulator. Assessment of
      laparoscopic performance was based on FLS scoring, whereas a questionnaire was
      used for subjective evaluation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The performance
      scores in the 2 simulators were nearly identical. Experts performed better than
      intermediates and novices in both the FLS trainer and the VBLAST, and
      intermediates performed better than novices in both simulators. The results also 
      show a significant learning effect on both trainers for all subgroups; however,
      the greatest learning effect was in the novice group for both trainers.
      Subjectively, 74% participants preferred the FLS over the VBLaST for training
      laparoscopic surgical skills. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the peg
      transfer task was reproduced well in the VBLaST in gynecologic surgeons and
      trainees. The VBLaST has the potential to be a valuable tool in laparoscopic
      training for gynecologic surgeons.

TI  - Laparoscopic skill improvement after virtual reality simulator training in
      medical students as assessed by augmented reality simulator.
LID - 10.1111/ases.12209 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Definitive assessment of laparoscopic skill improvement after
      virtual reality simulator training is best obtained during an actual operation.
      However, this is impossible in medical students. Therefore, we developed an
      alternative assessment technique using an augmented reality simulator. METHODS:
      Nineteen medical students completed a 6-week training program using a virtual
      reality simulator (LapSim). The pretest and post-test were performed using an
      object-positioning module and cholecystectomy on an augmented reality
      simulator(ProMIS). The mean performance measures between pre- and post-training
      on the LapSim were compared with a paired t-test. RESULTS: In the
      object-positioning module, the execution time of the task (P < 0.001), left and
      right instrument path length (P = 0.001), and left and right instrument economy
      of movement (P < 0.001) were significantly shorter after than before the LapSim
      training. With respect to improvement in laparoscopic cholecystectomy using a
      gallbladder model, the execution time to identify, clip, and cut the cystic duct 
      and cystic artery as well as the execution time to dissect the gallbladder away
      from the liver bed were both significantly shorter after than before the LapSim
      training (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our training curriculum using a virtual reality
      simulator improved the operative skills of medical students as objectively
      evaluated by assessment using an augmented reality simulator instead of an actual
      operation. We hope that these findings help to establish an effective training
      program for medical students.

AB  - This review investigates the available literature that addresses the impact
      simulator training has on patient outcomes. The authors conducted a comprehensive
      literature search of studies reporting outcomes of simulation training and
      categorized studies based on the Kirkpatrick model of training evaluation.
      Kirkpatrick level 4 studies reporting patient outcomes were identified and
      included in this review. Existing evidence is promising, demonstrating patient
      benefits as a result of simulation training for central line placement, obstetric
      emergencies, cataract surgery, laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, and team
      training.

AB  - The use of simulation in Graduate Medical Education has evolved significantly
      over time, particularly during the past decade. The applications of simulation
      include introductory and basic technical skills, more advanced technical skills, 
      and nontechnical skills, and simulation is gaining acceptance in high-stakes
      assessments. Simulation-based training has also brought about paradigm shifts in 
      the medical and surgical education arenas and has borne new and exciting national
      and local consortia that will ensure that the scope and impact of simulation will
      continue to broaden.

TI  - Virtual-Reality Simulator System for Double Interventional Cardiac
      Catheterization Using Fractional-Order Vascular Access Tracker and Haptic Force
      Producer.
PG  - 697569
LID - 10.1155/2015/697569 [doi]
AB  - This study proposes virtual-reality (VR) simulator system for double
      interventional cardiac catheterization (ICC) using fractional-order vascular
      access tracker and haptic force producer. An endoscope or a catheter for
      diagnosis and surgery of cardiovascular disease has been commonly used in
      minimally invasive surgery. It needs specific skills and experiences for young
      surgeons or postgraduate year (PGY) students to operate a Berman catheter and a
      pigtail catheter in the inside of the human body and requires avoiding damaging
      vessels. To improve the training in inserting catheters, a double-catheter
      mechanism is designed for the ICC procedures. A fractional-order vascular access 
      tracker is used to trace the senior surgeons' consoled trajectories and transmit 
      the frictional feedback and visual feedback during the insertion of catheters.
      Based on the clinical feeling through the aortic arch, vein into the ventricle,
      or tortuous blood vessels, haptic force producer is used to mock the elasticity
      of the vessel wall using voice coil motors (VCMs). The VR establishment with
      surgeons' consoled vessel trajectories and hand feeling is achieved, and the
      experimental results show the effectiveness for the double ICC procedures.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial to Assess the Effects of Competition on the
      Development of Laparoscopic Surgical Skills.
LID - S1931-7204(15)00157-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jsurg.2015.06.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serious games have demonstrated efficacy in improving participation
      in surgical training activities, but studies have not yet demonstrated the effect
      of serious gaming on performance. This study investigated whether competitive
      training (CT) affects laparoscopic surgical performance. METHODS: A total of 20
      novices were recruited, and 18 (2 dropouts) were randomized into control or CT
      groups to perform 10 virtual reality laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LCs).
      Competitiveness of each participant was assessed. The CT group members were
      informed they were competing to outperform one another for a prize; performance
      ranking was shown before each session. The control group did not compete.
      Performance was assessed on time, movements, and instrument path length. Quality 
      of performance was assessed with a global rating scale score. RESULTS: There were
      no significant intergroup differences in baseline skill or measured
      competitiveness. Time and global rating scale score, at final LC, were not
      significantly different between groups; however, the CT group was significantly
      more dexterous than control and had significantly lower variance in number of
      movements and instrument path length at the final LC (p = 0.019). Contentiousness
      was inversely related to time in the CT group. CONCLUSION: This was the first
      randomized controlled trial to investigate if CT can enhance performance in
      laparoscopic surgery. CT may lead to improved dexterity in laparoscopic surgery
      but yields otherwise similar performance to that of standard training in novices.
      Competition may have different effects on novices vs experienced surgeons, and
      subsequent research should investigate CT in experienced surgeons as well.

TI  - A new possibility in thoracoscopic virtual reality simulation training:
      development and testing of a novel virtual reality simulator for video-assisted
      thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy.
PG  - 420-6
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivv183 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to develop virtual reality simulation
      software for video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy, to explore the
      opinions of thoracic surgeons concerning the VATS lobectomy simulator and to test
      the validity of the simulator metrics. METHODS: Experienced VATS surgeons worked 
      with computer specialists to develop a VATS lobectomy software for a virtual
      reality simulator. Thoracic surgeons with different degrees of experience in VATS
      were enrolled at the 22nd meeting of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons
      (ESTS) held in Copenhagen in June 2014. The surgeons were divided according to
      the number of performed VATS lobectomies: novices (0 VATS lobectomies),
      intermediates (1-49 VATS lobectomies) and experienced (>50 VATS lobectomies). The
      participants all performed a lobectomy of a right upper lobe on the simulator and
      answered a questionnaire regarding content validity. Metrics were compared
      between the three groups. RESULTS: We succeeded in developing the first version
      of a virtual reality VATS lobectomy simulator. A total of 103 thoracic surgeons
      completed the simulated lobectomy and were distributed as follows: novices n =
      32, intermediates n = 45 and experienced n = 26. All groups rated the overall
      user realism of the VATS lobectomy scenario to a median of 5 on a scale 1-7, with
      7 being the best score. The experienced surgeons found the graphics and movements
      realistic and rated the scenario high in terms of usefulness as a training tool
      for novice and intermediate experienced thoracic surgeons, but not very useful as
      a training tool for experienced surgeons. The metric scores were not
      statistically significant between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to
      describe a commercially available virtual reality simulator for a VATS lobectomy.
      More than 100 thoracic surgeons found the simulator realistic, and hence it
      showed good content validity. However, none of the built-in simulator metrics
      could significantly distinguish between novice, intermediate experienced and
      experienced surgeons, and further development of the simulator software is
      necessary to develop valid metrics.

      learner-centered model.
PG  - S1-S14
LID - 10.1002/lary.25434 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Work-hour restrictions, increased workload, and subjective
      assessment of competency are major threats to the efficacy of the traditional
      apprenticeship model of surgical training in modern surgical practice. In
      response, medical educators are developing time- and resource-efficient
      competency-based models of surgical training. The purpose of our project was to
      develop, implement, and measure the outcomes of such objective and structured
      programs in otolaryngology. We also investigated factors affecting the learning
      curve, especially deliberate practice, formative feedback, and learners'
      autonomy. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal study. METHODS: To measure the 
      surgical skills of residents, we first developed and tested objective tools for
      otolaryngology procedures. Based on these instruments, we identified milestones
      of the procedures. Training on a virtual-reality simulator was validated to
      shorten the learning curve. We also studied a learner-centered approach of
      training, factors affecting the learning curve, and barriers to a
      competency-based model. RESULTS: The objective tools were found to be a feasible,
      reliable, and valid opportunity for measuring competency in both the laboratory
      and operating room. With the formative assessment from these tools, residents had
      a remediation target to be achieved by deliberate practice. The milestones helped
      identify the threshold of competency, and deliberate practice on the simulator
      gave an opportunity for improving skills. The learner-centered approach allowed
      flexibility and personalized learning by shifting the responsibility of the
      learning process to the learners. CONCLUSION: The competency-based model of
      residency, based on the principles of deliberate practice and a learner-centered 
      approach, is a feasible model of residency training that allows development of
      competent surgeons and hence improves patient outcomes. Despite these advantages,
      challenges to this model require a concerted effort to overcome and fully
      implement these principles of training beyond just technical skills, ultimately
      creating well-rounded medical professionals and leaders in the surgical field.

      in virtual reality (VR) mastoidectomy simulation. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective
      trial. METHODS: Forty novice medical students performed 12 repeated virtual
      mastoidectomy procedures in the Visible Ear Simulator: 21 completed distributed
      practice with practice blocks spaced in time and 19 participants completed massed
      practice (all practices performed in 1 day). Participants were randomized for
      tutoring with the simulator-integrated tutor function. Cognitive load was
      estimated by measuring reaction time in a secondary task. Data were analyzed
      using linear mixed models for repeated measurements. RESULTS: The mean reaction
      time increased by 37% during the procedure compared with baseline, demonstrating 
      that the procedure placed substantial cognitive demands. Repeated practice
      significantly lowered CL in the distributed practice group but not in massed
      practice group. In addition, CL was found to be further increased by 10.3% in the
      later and more complex stages of the procedure. The simulator-integrated tutor
      function did not have an impact on CL. CONCLUSION: Distributed practice decreased
      CL in repeated VR mastoidectomy training more consistently than was seen in
      massed practice. This suggests a possible effect of skills and memory
      consolidation occurring over time. To optimize technical skills learning,
      training should be organized as time-distributed practice rather than as a massed
      block of practice, which is common in skills-training courses. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:

TI  - Evaluation of Sensory and Motor Skills in Neurosurgery Applicants Using a Virtual
      Reality Neurosurgical Simulator: The Sensory-Motor Quotient.

LID - 10.1016/j.jsurg.2015.04.030 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Manual skill is an important attribute for any surgeon. Current
      methods to evaluate sensory-motor skills in neurosurgical residency applicants
      are limited. We aim to develop an objective multifaceted measure of sensory-motor
      skills using a virtual reality surgical simulator. DESIGN: A set of 3 tests of
      sensory-motor function was performed using a 3-dimensional surgical simulator
      with head and arm tracking, collocalization, and haptic feedback. (1) Trajectory 
      planning: virtual reality drilling of a pedicle. Entry point, target point, and
      trajectory were scored-evaluating spatial memory and orientation. (2) Motor
      planning: sequence, timing, and precision: hemostasis in a postresection cavity
      in the brain. (3) Haptic perception: touching virtual spheres to determine which 
      is softest of the group, with progressive difficulty. Results were analyzed
      individually and for a combined score of all the tasks. SETTING: The University
      of Chicago Hospital's tertiary care academic center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 95 
      consecutive applicants interviewed at a neurosurgery residency program over 2
      years were offered anonymous participation in the study; in 2 cohorts, 36
      participants in year 1 and 27 participants in year 2 (validation cohort) agreed
      and completed all the tasks. We also tested 10 first-year medical students and 4 
      first- and second-year neurosurgery residents. RESULTS: A cumulative score was
      generated from the 3 tests. The mean score was 14.47 (standard deviation = 4.37),
      median score was 13.42, best score was 8.41, and worst score was 30.26. Separate 
      analysis of applicants from each of 2 years yielded nearly identical results.
      Residents tended to cluster on the better performance side, and first-year
      students were not different from applicants. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Our cumulative
      score measures sensory-motor skills in an objective and reproducible way. (2)
      Better performance by residents hints at validity for neurosurgery. (3) We were
      able to demonstrate good psychometric qualities and generate a proposed
      sensory-motor quotient distribution in our tested population.

TI  - Augmented reality visualization of deformable tubular structures for surgical
      simulation.
LID - 10.1002/rcs.1681 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical simulation based on augmented reality (AR), mixing the
      benefits of physical and virtual simulation, represents a step forward in
      surgical training. However, available systems are unable to update the virtual
      anatomy following deformations impressed on actual anatomy. METHODS: A
      proof-of-concept solution is described providing AR visualization of hidden
      deformable tubular structures using nitinol tubes sensorized with electromagnetic
      sensors. This system was tested in vitro on a setup comprised of sensorized
      cystic, left and right hepatic, and proper hepatic arteries. In the trial
      session, the surgeon deformed the tubular structures with surgical forceps in 10 
      positions. RESULTS: The mean, standard deviation, and maximum misalignment
      between virtual and real arteries were 0.35, 0.22, and 0.99 mm, respectively.
      CONCLUSION: The alignment accuracy obtained demonstrates the feasibility of the
      approach, which can be adopted in advanced AR simulations, in particular as an
      aid to the identification and isolation of tubular structures. Copyright (c) 2015

TI  - The Relationship of Endoscopic Proficiency to Educational Expense for Virtual
      Reality Simulator Training Amongst Surgical Trainees.
PG  - 747-52
AB  - With the introduction of Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery, training methods in 
      flexible endoscopy are being augmented with simulation-based curricula. The
      investment for virtual reality simulators warrants further research into its
      training advantage. Trainees were randomized into bedside or simulator training
      groups (BED vs SIM). SIM participated in a proficiency-based virtual reality
      curriculum. Trainees' endoscopic skills were rated using the Global Assessment of
      Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Skills (GAGES) in the patient care setting. The
      number of cases to reach 90 per cent of the maximum GAGES score and calculated
      costs of training were compared. Nineteen residents participated in the study.
      There was no difference in the average number of cases required to achieve 90 per
      cent of the maximum GAGES score for esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 13 (SIM) versus11
      (BED) (P = 0.63), or colonoscopy 21 (SIM) versus 4 (BED) (P = 0.34). The average 
      per case cost of training for esophagogastroduodenoscopy was $35.98 (SIM) versus 
      $39.71 (BED) (P = 0.50), not including the depreciation costs associated with the
      simulator ($715.00 per resident over six years). Use of a simulator appeared to
      increase the cost of training without accelerating the learning curve or
      decreasing faculty time spent in instruction. The importance of simulation in
      endoscopy training will be predicated on more cost-effective simulators.

TI  - Validity evidence for a new portable, lower-cost platform for the fundamentals of
      endoscopic surgery skills test.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The fundamentals of endoscopic surgery (FES) examination measures the
      knowledge and skills required to perform safe flexible endoscopy. A potential
      limitation of the FES skills test is the size and cost of the simulator on which 
      it was developed (GI Mentor II virtual reality endoscopy simulator; Simbionix
      LTD, Israel). A more compact and lower-cost alternative (GI Mentor Express) was
      developed to address this issue. The purpose of this study was to obtain evidence
      for the validity of scores obtained on the Express platform, so that it can be
      used for testing. STUDY DESIGN: General surgery residents at various levels of
      training and practicing endoscopists at five institutions participated. Each
      completed the five FES tasks on both simulator platforms in random order, with
      3-14 days between tests. Scores were calculated using the same standardized
      computer-generated algorithm and compared using Pearson's correlation
      coefficient. RESULTS: There were 58 participants (mean age 32; 76 % male) with a 
      broad range of endoscopic experience. The mean (95 % confidence interval) FES
      scores were 72 (67:77) on the GI Mentor II and 66 (60:71) on the Express. The
      correlation between scores on the two platforms was 0.86 (0.77:0.91; p < 0.0001).
      CONCLUSION: There is a high correlation between FES manual skills scores measured
      on the original platform and the new Express, providing evidence to support the
      use of the GI Mentor Express for FES testing.

      assessment.
PG  - 63
LID - 10.1186/s12894-015-0051-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We performed a pilot study using a single virtual-simulation suturing
      module as an objective measurement to determine functional use of the robotic
      system. This study will assist in designing a study for an objective, adjunctive 
      test for use by a surgical proctor. METHODS: After IRB approval, subjects were
      recruited at a robotic renal surgery course to perform two attempts of the
      "Tubes" module without warm-up using the Da Vinci(R) Surgical Skills Simulator.
      The overall MScore (%) from the simulator was compared among various skill levels
      to provide construct validity. Correlation with MScore and number of robotic
      cases was performed and pre-determined skill groups were tested. Nine metrics
      that make up the overall score were also tested via paired t test and subsequent 
      logistic regression to determine which skills differed among experienced and
      novice robotic surgeons. RESULTS: We enrolled 38 subjects with experience ranging
      from 0- < 200 robotic cases. Median time to complete both tasks was less than 10 
      min. The MScore on the first attempt was correlated to the number of previous
      robotic cases (R(2) = 0.465; p = 0.003). MScore was different between novice and 
      more experienced robotic surgeons on the first (44.7 vs. 63.9; p = 0.005) and
      second attempt (56.0 vs. 69.9; p = 0.037). CONCLUSION: A single virtual simulator
      exercise can provide objective information in determining proficient use of the
      robotic surgical system.

TI  - Assessing Arthroscopic Skills Using Wireless Elbow-Worn Motion Sensors.
PG  - 1119-27
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.N.01043 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of surgical skill is a critical component of surgical
      training. Approaches to assessment remain predominantly subjective, although more
      objective measures such as Global Rating Scales are in use. This study aimed to
      validate the use of elbow-worn, wireless, miniaturized motion sensors to assess
      the technical skill of trainees performing arthroscopic procedures in a simulated
      environment. METHODS: Thirty participants were divided into three groups on the
      basis of their surgical experience: novices (n = 15), intermediates (n = 10), and
      experts (n = 5). All participants performed three standardized tasks on an
      arthroscopic virtual reality simulator while wearing wireless wrist and elbow
      motion sensors. Video output was recorded and a validated Global Rating Scale was
      used to assess performance; dexterity metrics were recorded from the simulator.
      Finally, live motion data were recorded via Bluetooth from the wireless wrist and
      elbow motion sensors and custom algorithms produced an arthroscopic performance
      score. RESULTS: Construct validity was demonstrated for all tasks, with Global
      Rating Scale scores and virtual reality output metrics showing significant
      differences between novices, intermediates, and experts (p < 0.001). The
      correlation of the virtual reality path length to the number of hand movements
      calculated from the wireless sensors was very high (p < 0.001). A comparison of
      the arthroscopic performance score levels with virtual reality output metrics
      also showed highly significant differences (p < 0.01). Comparisons of the
      arthroscopic performance score levels with the Global Rating Scale scores showed 
      strong and highly significant correlations (p < 0.001) for both sensor locations,
      but those of the elbow-worn sensors were stronger and more significant (p <
      0.001) than those of the wrist-worn sensors. CONCLUSIONS: A new wireless
      assessment of surgical performance system for objective assessment of surgical
      skills has proven valid for assessing arthroscopic skills. The elbow-worn sensors
      were shown to achieve an accurate assessment of surgical dexterity and
      performance. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The validation of an entirely objective
      assessment of arthroscopic skill with wireless elbow-worn motion sensors
      introduces, for the first time, a feasible assessment system for the live
      operating theater with the added potential to be applied to other surgical and
      interventional specialties.

TI  - Usefulness of a Virtual Reality Percutaneous Trigeminal Rhizotomy Simulator in
      Neurosurgical Training.
PG  - 420-5; discussion 425

AB  - BACKGROUND: Simulation-based training may be incorporated into neurosurgery in
      the future. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of a novel haptics-based virtual 
      reality percutaneous trigeminal rhizotomy simulator. METHODS: A real-time
      augmented reality simulator for percutaneous trigeminal rhizotomy was developed
      using the ImmersiveTouch platform. Ninety-two neurosurgery residents tested the
      simulator at American Association of Neurological Surgeons Top Gun 2014.
      Postgraduate year (PGY), number of fluoroscopy shots, the distance from the ideal
      entry point, and the distance from the ideal target were recorded by the system
      during each simulation session. Final performance score was calculated
      considering the number of fluoroscopy shots and distances from entry and target
      points (a lower score is better). The impact of PGY level on residents'
      performance was analyzed. RESULTS: Seventy-one residents provided their PGY-level
      and simulator performance data; 38% were senior residents and 62% were junior
      residents. The mean distance from the entry point (9.4 mm vs 12.6 mm, P = .01),
      the distance from the target (12.0 mm vs 15.2 mm, P = .16), and final score (31.1
      vs 37.7, P = .02) were lower in senior than in junior residents. The mean number 
      of fluoroscopy shots (9.8 vs 10.0, P = .88) was similar in these 2 groups. Linear
      regression analysis showed that increasing PGY level is significantly associated 
      with a decreased distance from the ideal entry point (P = .001), a shorter
      distance from target (P = .05), a better final score (P = .007), but not number
      of fluoroscopy shots (P = .52). CONCLUSION: Because technical performance of
      percutaneous rhizotomy increases with training, we proposed that the skills in
      performing the procedure in our virtual reality model would also increase with
      PGY level, if our simulator models the actual procedure. Our results confirm this
      hypothesis and demonstrate construct validity.

PG  - 564-70.e3
LID - 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2015.02.024 [doi]
LID - S1072-7515(15)00177-5 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The influence of fatigue on residents' performance in laparoscopy was
      prospectively assessed through a computer-based virtual reality simulation (VRS) 
      model. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-six residents (14 novices, 12 experienced) were
      recruited. In the first stage, each participant was initially tested on 8
      VRS-based tasks. In the second, run-in stage, each resident had 8 hours of
      hands-on practice of the specific tasks chosen. Finally, participants were
      evaluated before and after 24 hours on call. For each task, a set of parameters
      reflecting proficiency, efficacy, and safety were documented. RESULTS: In most of
      the tasks assessed, sleep deprivation had a significant deleterious effect on the
      performance of residents, both in terms of efficiency (time to complete the
      task), and safety (errors). These observations were more pronounced among
      novices. For example, in camera manipulation at a 30-degree angle, the total time
      to complete the task was slower after sleep deprivation (novices: sleep
      deprivation = 136 seconds, control = 119 seconds; experienced: sleep deprivation 
      = 112 seconds, control = 103 seconds; p = 0.03). Moreover, accuracy rates were
      lower after sleep deprivation: in the "grasping and clipping" task, a lower
      accuracy rate after sleep deprivation was noted (novices: sleep deprivation =
      82.8%, control = 87.9%; experienced: sleep deprivation = 87.6%, control = 90.8%; 
      p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospectively controlled study we observed
      reduced efficiency and safety in the performance of residents after sleep
      deprivation. Using an innovative study design, we eliminated the learning curve
      bias. Compared with novices, experienced residents performed relatively better
      after a night shift, and this may be attributed to better adaptation to sleep
      deprivation.

TI  - Wii Fit exercise therapy for the rehabilitation of ankle sprains: Its effect
      compared with physical therapy or no functional exercises at all.
LID - 10.1111/sms.12509 [doi]
AB  - Lateral ankle sprains represent the most common sports-related injuries. The
      Nintendo Wii Fit could be useful in the treatment of ankle sprains. The aim of
      this study was to compare the effectiveness of exercise training using the Wii
      Fit in ankle sprain patients: (a) with physical therapy; and (b) a control group 
      not receiving any treatment. Ninety lateral ankle sprain patients were randomized
      to a Wii Fit, physical therapy, or control group. We assessed the following
      outcome measures before, and 6 weeks after starting the allocated treatment: Foot
      and Ankle Ability Measure, pain during rest and walking, delay before return to
      sport, patient satisfaction, and effectiveness of the allocated treatment. Six
      weeks after the baseline measures, foot and ankle ability scores had improved in 
      all groups, and pain had decreased during walking (P < 0.050). No between-group
      differences were detected between Wii Fit treatment, and both other groups (P >
      0.050). In conclusion, the Wii Fit could be used as an exercise therapy to treat 
      ankle sprain patients. However, Wii Fit was not more effective than only physical
      therapy, or no exercise therapy at all. Patients who did not receive treatment
      showed similar results as people who got any kind of exercise therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Simulation-based training (SBT) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCCY)
      provides an opportunity for junior residents to learn the procedure in a safe,
      nonthreatening environment. Mental rehearsal (MR) has the potential of augmenting
      skill acquisition. This project investigated the correlation between MR of LCCY
      with performance on 2 different types of simulators: a procedural task (PT)
      training model and virtual reality (VR) machine. DESIGN: Prospective,
      quasi-experimental design with purposeful sampling. Postgraduate years (PGYs) 1
      through 3 general surgical residents underwent standardized, distributed SBT in
      LCCY on either a PT trainer or a VR machine with group-based MR undertaken before
      2 SBT sessions. Participants completed a pre-MR and post-MR session mental
      imagery questionnaire (MIQ) containing 8-items using a 7-point Likert-type scale.
      Data related to VR objective measures and PT video-based performances were also
      collected. Total scale mean scores were calculated for the first MR session and
      the second MR session and were compared using the t test. Pearson correlation
      analysis of MIQ scores with performance scores was determined. SETTING: Louisiana
      State University Health New Orleans Health Sciences Center in New Orleans,
      Louisiana. This health sciences center is a tertiary care, academic state
      institution located in the Southeastern United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of
      21 PGYs 1 through 3 general surgery residents participated. They were
      purposefully divided into the PT and VR training groups to allow for even PGY
      distribution. Of the 21 participants, 19 completed both training sessions (n = 10
      for PT [PGY1 = 4, PGY2 = 4, PGY3 = 2] and n = 9 for VR [PGY1 = 4, PGY2 = 3, PGY3 
      = 2]). RESULTS: After the Bonferroni adjustment, significant gains in the MIQ
      items related to confidence, visual imagery, and knowledge of the procedure were 
      found. VR performance data demonstrated some statistically significant
      improvements. A significant negative correlation was present between the
      two-handed clip-and-cut VR task and MIQ gains. CONCLUSIONS: Group MR in LCCY
      before SBT on a VR machine is related to improved performance time for the VR
      two-handed clip-and-cut task. MR may be a useful adjunct to SBT LCCY. Future work
      will look at the translation of these skills to clinical practice.

TI  - The next evolution in radioguided surgery: breast cancer related sentinel node
      localization using a freehandSPECT-mobile gamma camera combination.
PG  - 233-45
AB  - Accurate pre- and intraoperative identification of the sentinel node (SN) forms
      the basis of the SN biopsy procedure. Gamma tracing technologies such as a gamma 
      probe (GP), a 2D mobile gamma camera (MGC) or 3D freehandSPECT (FHS) can be used 
      to provide the surgeon with radioguidance to the SN(s). We reasoned that
      integrated use of these technologies results in the generation of a "hybrid"
      modality that combines the best that the individual radioguidance technologies
      have to offer. The sensitivity and resolvability of both 2D-MGC and 3D-FHS-MGC
      were studied in a phantom setup (at various source-detector depths and using
      varying injection site-to-SN distances), and in ten breast cancer patients
      scheduled for SN biopsy. Acquired 3D-FHS-MGC images were overlaid with the
      position of the phantom/patient. This augmented-reality overview image was then
      used for navigation to the hotspot/SN in virtual-reality using the GP. Obtained
      results were compared to conventional gamma camera lymphoscintigrams. Resolution 
      of 3D-FHS-MGC allowed identification of the SNs at a minimum injection site (100 
      MBq)-to-node (1 MBq; 1%) distance of 20 mm, up to a source-detector depth of 36
      mm in 2D-MGC and up to 24 mm in 3D-FHS-MGC. A clinically relevant dose of
      approximately 1 MBq was clearly detectable up to a depth of 60 mm in 2D-MGC and
      48 mm in 3D-FHS-MGC. In all ten patients at least one SN was visualized on the
      lymphoscintigrams with a total of 12 SNs visualized. 3D-FHS-MGC identified 11 of 
      12 SNs and allowed navigation to all these visualized SNs; in one patient with
      two axillary SNs located closely to each other (11 mm), 3D-FHS-MGC was not able
      to distinguish the two SNs. In conclusion, high sensitivity detection of SNs at
      an injection site-to-node distance of 20 mm-and-up was possible using 3D-FHS-MGC.
      In patients, 3D-FHS-MGC showed highly reproducible images as compared to the
      conventional lymphoscintigrams.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The training and learning of residents in laparoscopic surgery has 
      legal, financial and technological limitations. Simulation is an essential tool
      in the training of residents as a supplement to their training in laparoscopic
      surgery. The training should be structured in an appropriate environment, with
      previously established and clear objectives, taught by professionals with
      clinical and teaching experience in simulation. The training should be conducted 
      with realistic models using animals and ex-vivo tissue from animals. It is
      essential to incorporate mechanisms to assess the objectives during the
      residents' training progress. OBJECTIVE: We present the training model for
      laparoscopic surgery for urology residents at the University Hospital Valdecilla.
      The training is conducted at the Virtual Hospital Valdecilla, which is associated
      with the Center for Medical Simulation in Boston and is accredited by the
      American College of Surgeons. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The model is designed in 3
      blocks, basic for R1, intermediate for R2-3 and advanced for R4-5, with 9
      training modules. The training is conducted in 4-hour sessions for 4 afternoons, 
      for 3 weeks per year of residence. Residents therefore perform 240hours of
      simulated laparoscopic training by the end of the course. For each module, we use
      structured objective assessments to measure each resident's training progress.
      RESULTS: Since 2003, 9 urology residents have been trained, in addition to the 5 
      who are currently in training. The model has undergone changes according to the
      needs expressed in the student feedback. The acquisition of skills in a virtual
      reality model has enabled the safe transfer of those skills to actual practice.
      CONCLUSIONS: A laparoscopic surgery training program designed in structured
      blocks and with progressive complexity provides appropriate training for
      transferring the skills acquired using this model to an actual scenario while
      maintaining patient safety.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We proposed to develop a novel virtual reality (VR) team training
      system. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of creating 
      a VR operating room to simulate a surgical crisis scenario and evaluate the
      simulator for construct and face validity. METHODS: We modified ICE STORM
      (Integrated Clinical Environment; Systems, Training, Operations, Research,
      Methods), a VR-based system capable of modeling a variety of health care
      personnel and environments. ICE STORM was used to simulate a standardized
      surgical crisis scenario, whereby participants needed to correct 4 elements
      responsible for loss of laparoscopic visualization. The construct and face
      validity of the environment were measured. RESULTS: Thirty-three participants
      completed the VR simulation. Attendings completed the simulation in less time
      than trainees (271 vs 201 seconds, P = .032). Participants felt the training
      environment was realistic and had a favorable impression of the simulation. All
      participants felt the workload of the simulation was low. CONCLUSIONS: Creation
      of a VR-based operating room for team training in surgery is feasible and can
      afford a realistic team training environment.

      Haptic Temporal Bone Simulation: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 263-8

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Simulation has assumed a prominent role in education. It is important 
      to explore the effectiveness of different modalities. In this article, we
      directly compare surgical resident impression of 2 distinct temporal bone
      simulations (physical and haptic). STUDY DESIGN: Research Ethics Board-approved
      prospective cohort study. SETTING: A haptic voxel-based virtual model (VM) and a 
      physical 3-dimensional printed temporal bone model (PBM) were developed.
      Participants rated each construct on a number of parameters and performed a
      direct comparison of the simulations using a survey instrument that employed a
      7-point Likert scale and rank lists. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ten otolaryngology
      residents dissected anatomically identical, matched physical and virtual models. 
      Data for both simulations originated from 10 unique cadaveric micro-computed
      tomography images. RESULTS: Subjects rated the PBM drill quality as being more
      similar to cadaveric temporal bone than the VM (cortical bone mean: 5.5 vs 3.2, P
      = .011; trabecular bone mean: 5.2 vs 2.8, P = .004) and with better air cell
      system representation (mean: 5.4 vs 4.5, P = .003). Subjects strongly agreed that
      both simulations are effective educational tools, but they rated the PBM higher
      (mean: 6.7 vs 5.4, P = .019). Notably, subjects agreed that both modalities
      should be integrated into training, but they were more favorably inclined toward 
      the PBM (mean: 7.0 vs 5.5, P = .002). In direct comparison, the PBM was the
      preferred simulation in 7 of 9 educational domains. CONCLUSIONS: Appraisal of a
      PBM and a VM found both to have perceived educational benefit. However, the PBM
      was considered to have more realistic physical properties and was considered the 
      preferred training instrument.

AB  - The Pico Lantern is a miniature projector developed for structured light surface 
      reconstruction, augmented reality and guidance in laparoscopic surgery. During
      surgery it will be dropped into the patient and picked up by a laparoscopic tool.
      While inside the patient it projects a known coded pattern and images onto the
      surface of the tissue. The Pico Lantern is visually tracked in the laparoscope's 
      field of view for the purpose of stereo triangulation between it and the
      laparoscope. In this paper, the first application is surface reconstruction.
      Using a stereo laparoscope and an untracked Pico Lantern, the absolute error for 
      surface reconstruction for a plane, cylinder and ex vivo kidney, is 2.0 mm, 3.0
      mm and 5.6 mm, respectively. Using a mono laparoscope and a tracked Pico Lantern 
      for the same plane, cylinder and kidney the absolute error is 1.4 mm, 1.5 mm and 
      1.5 mm, respectively. These results confirm the benefit of the wider baseline
      produced by tracking the Pico Lantern. Virtual viewpoint images are generated
      from the kidney surface data and an in vivo proof-of-concept porcine trial is
      reported. Surface reconstruction of the neck of a volunteer shows that the
      pulsatile motion of the tissue overlying a major blood vessel can be detected and
      displayed in vivo. Future work will integrate the Pico Lantern into standard and 
      robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: GI endoscopy simulation-based training augments early clinical
      performance; however, the optimal manner by which to deliver training is unknown.
      OBJECTIVE: We aimed to validate a simulation-based structured comprehensive
      curriculum (SCC) designed to teach technical, cognitive, and integrative
      competencies in colonoscopy. DESIGN: Single-blinded, randomized, controlled
      trial. SETTING: Endoscopic simulation course at an academic hospital.
      PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Thirty-three novice endoscopists were allocated
      to an SCC group or self-regulated learning (SRL) group. The SCC group received a 
      curriculum consisting of 6 hours of didactic lectures and 8 hours of virtual
      reality simulation-based training with expert feedback. The SRL group was
      provided a list of desired objectives and was instructed to practice on the
      simulator for an equivalent time (8 hours). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Clinical
      transfer was assessed during 2 patient colonoscopies using the Joint Advisory
      Group Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (JAG DOPS) scale. Secondary outcome
      measures included differences in procedural knowledge, immediate post-training
      simulation performance, and delayed post-training (4-6 weeks) performance during 
      an integrated scenario test on the JAG DOPS communication and integrated scenario
      global rating scales. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in baseline or
      post-training performance on the simulator task. The SCC group performed
      superiorly during their first and second clinical colonoscopies. Additionally,
      the SCC group demonstrated significantly better knowledge and
      colonoscopy-specific performance, communication, and global performance during
      the integrated scenario. LIMITATIONS: We were unable to measure SRL participants'
      effort outside of mandatory training. In addition, feedback metrics and number of
      available simulation cases are limited. CONCLUSIONS: These results support
      integration of endoscopy simulation into a structured curriculum incorporating
      instructional feedback and complementary didactic knowledge as a means to augment
      technical, cognitive, and integrative skills acquisition, as compared with SRL on
      virtual reality simulators. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT01991522.).

TI  - Virtual reality training versus blended learning of laparoscopic cholecystectomy:
      a randomized controlled trial with laparoscopic novices.

LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000000764 [doi]
AB  - This study compared virtual reality (VR) training with low cost-blended learning 
      (BL) in a structured training program.Training of laparoscopic skills outside the
      operating room is mandatory to reduce operative times and risks.Laparoscopy-naive
      medical students were randomized in 2 groups stratified for sex. The BL group (n 
      = 42) used E-learning for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and practiced basic
      skills with box trainers. The VR group (n = 42) trained basic skills and LC on
      the LAP Mentor II (Simbionix, Cleveland, OH). Each group trained 3 x 4 hours
      followed by a knowledge test concerning LC. Blinded raters assessed the operative
      performance of cadaveric porcine LC using the Objective Structured Assessment of 
      Technical Skills (OSATS). The LC was discontinued when it was not completed
      within 80 min. Students evaluated their training modality with questionnaires.The
      VR group completed the LC significantly faster and more often within 80 min than 
      BL (45% v 21%, P = .02). The BL group scored higher than the VR group in the
      knowledge test (13.3 +/- 1.3 vs 11.0 +/- 1.7, P < 0.001). Both groups showed
      equal operative performance of LC in the OSATS score (49.4 +/- 10.5 vs 49.7 +/-
      12.0, P = 0.90). Students generally liked training and felt well prepared for
      assisting in laparoscopic surgery. The efficiency of the training was judged
      higher by the VR group than by the BL group.VR and BL can both be applied for
      training the basics of LC. Multimodality training programs should be developed
      that combine the advantages of both approaches.

AB  - AYRA is software of virtual reality for training, planning and optimizing
      surgical procedures. AYRA was developed under a research, development and
      innovation project financed by the Andalusian Ministry of Health, called VirSSPA.
      Nowadays AYRA has been successfully used in more than 1160 real cases and after
      proving its efficiency it has been introduced in the clinical practice at the
      Virgen del Rocio University Hospital . Furthermore, AYRA allows generating
      physical 3D biomodels using rapid prototyping technology. They are used for
      surgical planning support, intraoperative reference or defect reconstruction. In 
      this paper, some of these tools and some real cases are presented.

TI  - Testing basic competency in knee arthroscopy using a virtual reality simulator:
      exploring validity and reliability.
PG  - 775-81
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.N.00747 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnostic knee arthroscopy is a common procedure that orthopaedic
      residents are expected to learn early in their training. Arthroscopy requires a
      different skill set from traditional open surgery, and many orthopaedic residents
      feel less prepared for arthroscopic procedures. Virtual reality simulation
      training and testing provide an opportunity to ensure basic competency before
      proceeding to supervised procedures in patients. METHODS: Twenty-six physicians
      (thirteen novices and thirteen experienced arthroscopic surgeons) were
      voluntarily recruited to perform a test consisting of five arthroscopic
      procedures on a knee arthroscopy simulator. Performance was evaluated by
      obtaining predefined metrics from the simulator for each procedure, and z-scores,
      describing suboptimal performance, were calculated from the metrics. The
      intercase reliability of the simulator metrics was explored by calculating an
      intraclass correlation coefficient. Finally, a pass-or-fail standard was set with
      use of the contrasting groups method, and the consequences of the pass-or-fail
      standard were explored. RESULTS: One procedure was excluded from the final test
      because of a lack of validity. The total Z-scores for the four procedures
      included in the final test showed an intercase reliability of 0.87 (95%
      confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.93). The total mean z-score (and standard
      deviation) was 38.6 +/- 27.3 points for the novices and 0.0 +/- 9.1 points for
      the experienced surgeons (p < 0.0005). The pass-or-fail standard was set at a
      total z-score of 15.5 points, resulting in two of the novices passing the test
      and a single experienced surgeon failing the test. CONCLUSIONS: By combining four
      procedures on a virtual reality arthroscopy simulator, it was possible to create 
      a valid, reliable, and feasible test of basic arthroscopic competency and to
      establish a credible pass-or-fail standard. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The
      simulation-based test and pass-or-fail standard could aid in assessing and
      ensuring basic competency of future orthopaedic residents before proceeding to
      supervised procedures in patients.

TI  - Linear accuracy and reliability of volume data sets acquired by two CBCT-devices 
      and an MSCT using virtual models: A comparative in-vitro study.
PG  - 51-9
LID - 10.3109/00016357.2015.1040064 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discriminate clinically relevant aberrance, the accuracy of linear 
      measurements in three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed datasets was investigated.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three partly edentulous human skulls were examined.
      Landmarks were defined prior to acquisition. Two CBCT-scanners and a Quad-slice
      CT-scanner were used. Actual distances were physically measured with calipers and
      defined as a reference. Subsequently, from digital DICOM datasets, 3D virtual
      models were generated using maximum intensity projections (MIPs). Linear
      measurements were performed by semi-automated image analysis. Virtual and
      analogue linear measurements were compared using repeated measurements in a mixed
      model (p </= 0.05). RESULTS: No significant difference was found among all of the
      digital measurements when compared to one another, whereas a significant
      difference was found in matched-pairs analysis between CBCT and calipers (p =
      0.032). All digitally acquired data resulted in lower mean values compared to the
      measurements via calipers. A high level of inter-observer reliability was
      obtained in the digital measurements (inter-rater correlation = 0.988-0.993).
      CONCLUSIONS: The reconstructed datasets led to highly consistent values among
      linear measurements. Yielding sub-millimeter precision, these modalities are
      assumed to reflect reality in a clinically irrelevant altered manner. During data
      acquisition and evaluation, a maximum of precision must be achieved.

TI  - Virtual reality: a proposal for pelvic floor muscle training.
PG  - 1709-12
LID - 10.1007/s00192-015-2698-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: This video's proposal was to present one of the
      pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training programs, used in our research, that we
      designed as a virtual reality intervention protocol and investigated its effects 
      on PFM contractility. METHODS: Two clinical, controlled and prospective studies
      were conducted, one with 19 nulliparous women without urinary symptoms, who were 
      evaluated by both electromyography and digital palpation (DP) and another with 27
      postmenopausal women with mixed urinary symptoms (assessed by both ICIQ UI-SF and
      ICIQ-OAB), evaluated by vaginal dynamometry and DP, with a total of 46 women in
      both studies. This protocol was designed so that the participant would play a
      video game, seated on a pressure base platform, while commanding it through her
      pelvic movements. Using a virtual reality game, five activities were performed
      during 30 min, twice a week, with a total of 10 sessions. RESULTS: A significant 
      increase in PFM strength was found in both the nulliparous (p = 0.0001) and the
      postmenopausal (p = 0.0001) groups of women, as ascertained by DP. A significant 
      increase in postmenopausal women's muscle strength and endurance assessed by
      dynamometry (p = 0.05) and a concomitant decrease in their urinary symptoms, were
      observed. CONCLUSION: This virtual reality program promoted an increase in PFM
      contractility and a decrease in postmenopausal urinary symptoms.

TI  - Identifying Opportunities for Virtual Reality Simulation in Surgical Education: A
      Review of the Proceedings from the Innovation, Design, and Emerging Alliances in 
      Surgery (IDEAS) Conference: VR Surgery.
PG  - 514-21
LID - 10.1177/1553350615583559 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To conduct a review of the state of virtual reality (VR) simulation
      technology, to identify areas of surgical education that have the greatest
      potential to benefit from it, and to identify challenges to implementation.
      BACKGROUND DATA: Simulation is an increasingly important part of surgical
      training. VR is a developing platform for using simulation to teach technical
      skills, behavioral skills, and entire procedures to trainees and practicing
      surgeons worldwide. Questions exist regarding the science behind the technology
      and most effective usage of VR simulation. A symposium was held to address these 
      issues. METHODS: Engineers, educators, and surgeons held a conference in November
      2013 both to review the background science behind simulation technology and to
      create guidelines for its use in teaching and credentialing trainees and surgeons
      in practice. RESULTS: Several technologic challenges were identified that must be
      overcome in order for VR simulation to be useful in surgery. Specific areas of
      student, resident, and practicing surgeon training and testing that would likely 
      benefit from VR were identified: technical skills, team training and
      decision-making skills, and patient safety, such as in use of electrosurgical
      equipment. CONCLUSIONS: VR simulation has the potential to become an essential
      piece of surgical education curriculum but depends heavily on the establishment
      of an agreed upon set of goals. Researchers and clinicians must collaborate to
      allocate funding toward projects that help achieve these goals. The
      recommendations outlined here should guide further study and implementation of VR
      simulation.

TI  - [Femoral tunnel positioning in posterior cruciate ligament double-bundle
      reconstruction by computer aided design].
PG  - 162-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study mechanical affect of knee joint of reasonable positioning of 
      femoral tunnel during knee posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) double-bundle
      reconstruction and graft fixation after reconstruction by virtual reality
      interactive technology and evaluate the biomechanical response of knee after
      reconstruction by finite element analysis. METHODS: Knee specimens from five
      fresh frozen cadavers were used. Computer simulations and biomechanical
      experiments were used in this study. Experiments on flexion and extension
      movements of the knee joint were performed on specimens of fresh human knee
      joint. Laser three dimensional scanning was used to record and calculate the
      indexes of movements. Three-dimensional models of knee joint bone structure were 
      then reconstructed on computer with the experimental data. Simulations of flexion
      and extension movements were carried out on the models to show the spatial
      positions of femur and tibia and label the attachment sites of PCL. Ten test
      points in the anterior,posterior, proximal, distal at the femoral attachment area
      of anterior and lateral bundle (ALB) and postoperior medial bundle (PMB) were
      selected and the central points of tibial en attachment areat anchored. The
      distance btween each two points of two article surface was calculated and
      contacted by software of Geomagic. Model was import software Ansys, adopting the 
      tetrahedron unit a finite element model of complex tibial and femoral was set up 
      to simulat human walking in one leg,on this condition the the joint surface force
      of model under weight impact load were analyzed. RESULTS: The three-dimensional
      models could demonstrate the spatial positions of the bone structure of the knee 
      in different flexions and extensions. The models could be used to measure the
      spatial distance between 2 points on the femoral and tibial planes by software
      Geomagic. There was significantly difference among the length changes of
      anterolateral bundle and posteromedial bundle at every fixed point with different
      flexion angles (P<0.05), so the fixed angle with different points. The length
      changes of anterior lateral bundle's A2, A1 and posterior medial bundle's B3, B1 
      points were (1.35+/-0.19) mm, (5.41+/-1.22) mm, (1.95+/-0.04) mm and
      (5.23+/-2.21) mm, respectively. The A2 and B3 points' length changes were the
      less, and that of the Al and B1 points were the more. It had no significant
      difference between the length changes of anterior lanteral bundle's A2 and A3
      point (P=0.913>0.05). All of the maximal length changes of anterior lateral
      bundle's A2, A3 and postterior medial bundle's B3 points were less than 2 mm.
      CONCLUSION: The models of knee joint were builded through computer technology and
      it can be measure the lenth of cruciate ligament with software Geomagic exactly. 
      The femoral tunnel for the PCL double-bundle reconstruction should be located as 
      follows: ALB at the middle point of upper edge of femoral attachment site
      (proximal point),while PMB at the middle point of femoral attachment site
      (proximal point). This model provides a satisfactory method for the evaluation of
      the biomechanical response of knee after cruciate ligament reconstruction.

AB  - Background and purpose - Virtual-reality (VR) simulation in orthopedic training
      is still in its infancy, and much of the work has been focused on arthroscopy. We
      evaluated the construct validity of a new VR trauma simulator for performing
      dynamic hip screw (DHS) fixation of a trochanteric femoral fracture. Patients and
      methods - 30 volunteers were divided into 3 groups according to the number of
      postgraduate (PG) years and the amount of clinical experience: novice (1-4 PG
      years; less than 10 DHS procedures); intermediate (5-12 PG years; 10-100
      procedures); expert (> 12 PG years; > 100 procedures). Each participant performed
      a DHS procedure and objective performance metrics were recorded. These data were 
      analyzed with each performance metric taken as the dependent variable in 3
      regression models. Results - There were statistically significant differences in 
      performance between groups for (1) number of attempts at guide-wire insertion,
      (2) total fluoroscopy time, (3) tip-apex distance, (4) probability of screw
      cutout, and (5) overall simulator score. The intermediate group performed the
      procedure most quickly, with the lowest fluoroscopy time, the lowest tip-apex
      distance, the lowest probability of cutout, and the highest simulator score,
      which correlated with their frequency of exposure to running the trauma lists for
      hip fracture surgery. Interpretation - This study demonstrates the construct
      validity of a haptic VR trauma simulator with surgeons undertaking the procedure 
      most frequently performing best on the simulator. VR simulation may be a means of
      addressing restrictions on working hours and allows trainees to practice
      technical tasks without putting patients at risk. The VR DHS simulator evaluated 
      in this study may provide valid assessment of technical skill.

AB  - The surgical navigation system has experienced tremendous development over the
      past decades for minimizing the risks and improving the precision of the surgery.
      Nowadays, Augmented Reality (AR)-based surgical navigation is a promising
      technology for clinical applications. In the AR system, virtual and actual
      reality are mixed, offering real-time, high-quality visualization of an extensive
      variety of information to the users (Moussa et al., 2012) [1]. For example,
      virtual anatomical structures such as soft tissues, blood vessels and nerves can 
      be integrated with the real-world scenario in real time. In this study, an
      AR-based surgical navigation system (AR-SNS) is developed using an optical
      see-through HMD (head-mounted display), aiming at improving the safety and
      reliability of the surgery. With the use of this system, including the
      calibration of instruments, registration, and the calibration of HMD, the 3D
      virtual critical anatomical structures in the head-mounted display are aligned
      with the actual structures of patient in real-world scenario during the
      intra-operative motion tracking process. The accuracy verification experiment
      demonstrated that the mean distance and angular errors were respectively
      0.809+/-0.05mm and 1.038 degrees +/-0.05 degrees , which was sufficient to meet
      the clinical requirements.

AB  - TOPIC: This study reviews the evidence behind simulation-based surgical training 
      of ophthalmologists to determine (1) the validity of the reported models and (2) 
      the ability to transfer skills to the operating room. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
      Simulation-based training is established widely within ophthalmology, although it
      often lacks a scientific basis for implementation. METHODS: We conducted a
      systematic review of trials involving simulation-based training or assessment of 
      ophthalmic surgical skills among health professionals. The search included 5
      databases (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) and
      was completed on March 1, 2014. Overall, the included trials were divided into
      animal, cadaver, inanimate, and virtual-reality models. Risk of bias was assessed
      using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Validity evidence was evaluated using a 
      modern validity framework (Messick's). RESULTS: We screened 1368 reports for
      eligibility and included 118 trials. The most common surgery simulated was
      cataract surgery. Most validity trials investigated only 1 or 2 of 5 sources of
      validity (87%). Only 2 trials (48 participants) investigated transfer of skills
      to the operating room; 4 trials (65 participants) evaluated the effect of
      simulation-based training on patient-related outcomes. Because of heterogeneity
      of the studies, it was not possible to conduct a quantitative analysis.
      CONCLUSIONS: The methodologic rigor of trials investigating simulation-based
      surgical training in ophthalmology is inadequate. To ensure effective
      implementation of training models, evidence-based knowledge of validity and
      efficacy is needed. We provide a useful tool for implementation and evaluation of
      research in simulation-based training.

TI  - Neurosurgical Assessment of Metrics Including Judgment and Dexterity Using the
      Virtual Reality Simulator NeuroTouch (NAJD Metrics).
LID - 1553350615579729 [pii]
AB  - Advances in computer-based technology has created a significant opportunity for
      implementing new training paradigms in neurosurgery focused on improving skill
      acquisition, enhancing procedural outcome, and surgical skills assessment.
      NeuroTouch is a computer-based virtual reality system that can generate output
      data known as metrics from operator performance during simulated brain tumor
      resection. These measures of quantitative assessment are used to track and
      compare psychomotor performance during simulated operative procedures. Data
      output from the NeuroTouch system is recorded in a comma-separated values file.
      Data mining from this file and subsequent metrics development requires the use of
      sophisticated software and engineering expertise. In this article, we introduce a
      system to extract a series of new metrics using the same data file using Excel
      software. Based on the data contained in the NeuroTouch comma-separated values
      file, 13 novel NeuroTouch metrics were developed and classified. Tier 1 metrics
      include blood loss, tumor percentage resected, and total simulated normal brain
      volume removed. Tier 2 metrics include total instrument tip path length, maximum 
      force applied, sum of forces utilized, and average forces utilized by the
      simulated ultrasonic aspirator and suction instrument along with pedal activation
      frequency of the ultrasonic aspirator. Advanced tier 2 metrics include instrument
      tips average separation distance, efficiency index, ultrasonic aspirator path
      length index, coordination index, and ultrasonic aspirator bimanual forces ratio.
      This system of data extraction provides researchers expedited access for
      analyzing the data files available for NeuroTouch platform to assess the multiple
      psychomotor and cognitive neurosurgical skills involved in complex surgical
      procedures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessing the predictive validity of the LapSim simulator within a
      urology residency program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve urology residents at
      McGill University were enrolled in the study between June 2008 and December 2011.
      The residents had weekly training on the LapSim that consisted of 3 tasks
      (cutting, clip-applying, and lifting and grasping). They underwent monthly
      assessment of their LapSim performance using total time, tissue damage and path
      length among other parameters as surrogates for their economy of movement and
      respect for tissue. The last residents' LapSim performance was compared with
      their first performance of radical nephrectomy on anesthetized porcine models in 
      their 4(th) year of training. Two independent urologic surgeons rated the
      resident performance on the porcine models, and kappa test with standardized
      weight function was used to assess for inter-observer bias. Nonparametric
      spearman correlation test was used to compare each rater's cumulative score with 
      the cumulative score obtained on the porcine models in order to test the
      predictive validity of the LapSim simulator. RESULTS: The kappa results
      demonstrated acceptable agreement between the two observers among all domains of 
      the rating scale of performance except for confidence of movement and efficiency.
      In addition, poor predictive validity of the LapSim simulator was demonstrated.
      CONCLUSIONS: Predictive validity was not demonstrated for the LapSim simulator in
      the context of a urology residency training program.

TI  - Validation of virtual reality based simulations for endoscopic sinus surgery.
LID - 10.1111/coa.12414 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) simulators provide an alternative to real
      patients for practicing surgical skills but require validation to ensure
      accuracy. Here we validate the use of a virtual reality sinus surgery simulator
      with haptic feedback for training in Otorhinolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery
      (OHNS). METHODS: Participants were recruited from final year Medical Students,
      Interns, Resident Medical Officers (RMOs), OHNS Registrars and Consultants. All
      participants completed an online questionnaire after performing four separate
      simulation tasks. These were then used to assess face, content and construct
      validity. ANOVA with post-hoc correlation was used for statistical analysis.
      RESULTS: The following groups were compared: a) Medical Students / Interns, b)
      RMOs, c) Registrars and d) Consultants. Face validity results had a statistically
      significant (p<0.05) difference between the Consultant group and others while
      there was no significant difference between medical student/intern and RMOs.
      Variability within groups was not significant. Content validity results based on 
      Consultant scoring and comments indicated that the simulations need further
      development in several areas in order to be effective for Registrar-level
      teaching. However students, interns and RMOs indicated that the simulations
      provide a useful tool for learning OHNS related anatomy and as an introduction to
      ENT specific procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The VR simulations have been validated for 
      teaching sinus anatomy and nasendoscopy to Medical Students, Interns and RMOs.
      However, they require further development before they can be regarded as a valid 
      tool for more advanced surgical training. This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - Operator experience determines performance in a simulated computer-based brain
      tumor resection task.
PG  - 1853-62
LID - 10.1007/s11548-015-1160-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Develop measures to differentiate between experienced and inexperienced 
      neurosurgeons in a virtual reality brain surgery simulator environment. METHODS: 
      Medical students ([Formula: see text]) and neurosurgery residents ([Formula: see 
      text]) completed four simulated Glioblastoma multiforme resections. Simulated
      surgeries took place over four days with intermittent spacing in between (average
      time between surgeries of 4.77 [Formula: see text] 0.73 days). The volume of
      tumor removed (cc), volume of healthy brain removed (cc), and instrument path
      length (mm) were recorded. Additionally, surgical effectiveness (% tumor removed 
      divided by % healthy brain removed) and efficiency (% tumor removed divided by
      instrument movement in mm) were calculated. Performance was compared (1) between 
      groups, and (2) for each participant over time to assess the learning curve. In
      addition, the effect of real-time instruction ("coaching") was assessed with a
      randomly selected group of medical students. RESULTS: Neurosurgery residents
      removed less healthy brain, were more effective in removing tumor and sparing
      healthy brain tissue, required less instrument movement, and were more efficient 
      in removing tumor tissue than medical students. Medical students approached the
      resident level of performance over serial sessions. Coached medical students
      showed more conservative surgical behavior, removing both less tumor and less
      healthy brain. In sum, neurosurgery residents removed more tumor, removed less
      healthy brain, and required less instrument movement than medical students.
      Coaching modified medical student performance. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual Reality brain
      surgery can differentiate operators based on both recent and long-term experience
      and may be useful in the acquisition and assessment of neurosurgical skills.
      Coaching alters the learning curve of naive inexperienced individuals.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Novel Robotic Procedure Specific Simulation
      Platform: Partial Nephrectomy.
PG  - 520-6
LID - 10.1016/j.juro.2015.02.2949 [doi]
LID - S0022-5347(15)03389-3 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: We developed a novel procedure specific simulation platform for robotic 
      partial nephrectomy. In this study we prospectively evaluate its face, content,
      construct and concurrent validity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This hybrid platform
      features augmented reality and virtual reality. Augmented reality involves
      3-dimensional robotic partial nephrectomy surgical videos overlaid with virtual
      instruments to teach surgical anatomy, technical skills and operative steps.
      Advanced technical skills are assessed with an embedded full virtual reality
      renorrhaphy task. Participants were classified as novice (no surgical training,
      15), intermediate (less than 100 robotic cases, 13) or expert (100 or more
      robotic cases, 14) and prospectively assessed. Cohort performance was compared
      with the Kruskal-Wallis test (construct validity). Post-study questionnaire was
      used to assess the realism of simulation (face validity) and usefulness for
      training (content validity). Concurrent validity evaluated correlation between
      virtual reality renorrhaphy task and a live porcine robotic partial nephrectomy
      performance (Spearman's analysis). RESULTS: Experts rated the augmented reality
      content as realistic (median 8/10) and helpful for resident/fellow training
      (8.0-8.2/10). Experts rated the platform highly for teaching anatomy (9/10) and
      operative steps (8.5/10) but moderately for technical skills (7.5/10). Experts
      and intermediates outperformed novices (construct validity) in efficiency
      (p=0.0002) and accuracy (p=0.002). For virtual reality renorrhaphy, experts
      outperformed intermediates on GEARS metrics (p=0.002). Virtual reality
      renorrhaphy and in vivo porcine robotic partial nephrectomy performance
      correlated significantly (r=0.8, p <0.0001) (concurrent validity). CONCLUSIONS:
      This augmented reality simulation platform displayed face, content and construct 
      validity. Performance in the procedure specific virtual reality task correlated
      highly with a porcine model (concurrent validity). Future efforts will integrate 
      procedure specific virtual reality tasks and their global assessment.

TI  - Virtual reality simulation for the optimization of endovascular procedures:
      current perspectives.
PG  - 195-202
LID - 10.2147/VHRM.S46194 [doi]
AB  - Endovascular technologies are rapidly evolving, often requiring coordination and 
      cooperation between clinicians and technicians from diverse specialties. These
      multidisciplinary interactions lead to challenges that are reflected in the high 
      rate of errors occurring during endovascular procedures. Endovascular virtual
      reality (VR) simulation has evolved from simple benchtop devices to full physic
      simulators with advanced haptics and dynamic imaging and physiological controls. 
      The latest developments in this field include the use of fully immersive
      simulated hybrid angiosuites to train whole endovascular teams in crisis resource
      management and novel technologies that enable practitioners to build VR
      simulations based on patient-specific anatomy. As our understanding of the
      skills, both technical and nontechnical, required for optimal endovascular
      performance improves, the requisite tools for objective assessment of these
      skills are being developed and will further enable the use of VR simulation in
      the training and assessment of endovascular interventionalists and their entire
      teams. Simulation training that allows deliberate practice without danger to
      patients may be key to bridging the gap between new endovascular technology and
      improved patient outcomes.

LID - 10.1155/2015/495308 [doi]
AB  - Objectives. Here we developed a unique training system, a patient specific
      virtual reality simulator, for laparoscopic renal surgery. To develop the
      simulator, it was important to first identify the physical properties of the
      organ. Methods. We recorded the force measured during laparoscopic surgery
      performed on pigs by using forceps with pressure sensors. Several sensors,
      including strain gauges, accelerometers, and a potentiometer, are attached to the
      forceps. Results. Throughout the experiment, we measured the reaction force in
      response to the forceps movement in real time. Conclusions. The experiment showed
      the possibility of digitizing these physical properties in humans as well.

TI  - Arthroscopy skills development with a surgical simulator: a comparative study in 
      orthopaedic surgery residents.
PG  - 1526-9
LID - 10.1177/0363546515574064 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical simulation has become increasingly relevant to orthopaedic
      surgery education and could translate to improved operating room proficiency in
      orthopaedic surgery trainees. PURPOSE: To compare the arthroscopic performance of
      junior orthopaedic surgery residents who received training with a knee and
      shoulder arthroscopy surgical simulator with those who received didactic
      training. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Fourteen junior
      orthopaedic surgery residents at a single institution were randomized to receive 
      knee and shoulder arthroscopy training with a surgical simulator (n = 8) or
      didactic lectures with arthroscopy models (n = 6). After their respective
      training, performance in diagnostic knee and shoulder arthroscopy was assessed
      using a cadaveric model. Time to completion and assessment of arthroscopic
      handling using a subjective injury grading index (scale, 1-10) was then used to
      evaluate performance in final cadaveric testing. RESULTS: Orthopaedic surgery
      residents who trained with a surgical simulator outperformed the didactic-trained
      residents in shoulder arthroscopy by time to completion (-35%; P = .02) and
      injury grading index (-35%; P = .01). In addition, a trend toward improved
      performance of knee arthroscopy by the simulator-trained group was found by time 
      to completion (-36%; P = .09) and injury grading index (P = .08). CONCLUSION: In 
      this study, junior orthopaedic surgery residents who trained with a surgical
      simulator demonstrated improved arthroscopic performance in both knee and
      shoulder arthroscopy. However, future validation of surgical simulator training
      for orthopaedic surgery residents remains warranted. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Surgical
      skill development with an arthroscopy surgical simulator could translate to
      improved arthroscopy performance in the operating room.

TI  - Adaptive Mesh Expansion Model (AMEM) for liver segmentation from CT image.
PG  - e0118064
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0118064 [doi]
AB  - This study proposes a novel adaptive mesh expansion model (AMEM) for liver
      segmentation from computed tomography images. The virtual deformable simplex
      model (DSM) is introduced to represent the mesh, in which the motion of each
      vertex can be easily manipulated. The balloon, edge, and gradient forces are
      combined with the binary image to construct the external force of the deformable 
      model, which can rapidly drive the DSM to approach the target liver boundaries.
      Moreover, tangential and normal forces are combined with the gradient image to
      control the internal force, such that the DSM degree of smoothness can be
      precisely controlled. The triangular facet of the DSM is adaptively decomposed
      into smaller triangular components, which can significantly improve the
      segmentation accuracy of the irregularly sharp corners of the liver. The proposed
      method is evaluated on the basis of different criteria applied to 10 clinical
      data sets. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed AMEM algorithm is effective 
      and robust and thus outperforms six other up-to-date algorithms. Moreover, AMEM
      can achieve a mean overlap error of 6.8% and a mean volume difference of 2.7%,
      whereas the average symmetric surface distance and the root mean square symmetric
      surface distance can reach 1.3 mm and 2.7 mm, respectively.

TI  - Training safer surgeons: How do patients view the role of simulation in
      orthopaedic training?
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1186/s13037-015-0058-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Simulation allows training without posing risk to patient safety. It 
      has developed in response to the demand for patient safety and the reduced
      training times for surgeons. Whilst there is an increasing role of simulation in 
      orthopaedic training, the perception of patients and the general public of this
      novel method is yet unknown. Patients and the public were given the opportunity
      to perform a diagnostic knee arthroscopy on a virtual reality ARTHRO Mentor
      simulator. After their practice session, participants answered a validated
      questionnaire based on a 5-point Likert Scale assessing their opinions on
      arthroscopic simulation. Primary objective was observing perception of patients
      on orthopaedic virtual reality simulation. FINDINGS: There were a total of 159
      respondents, of which 86% were of the opinion that simulators are widely used in 
      surgical training and 94% felt that they should be compulsory. 91% would feel
      safer having an operation by a surgeon trained on simulators, 87% desired their
      surgeon to be trained on simulators and 72% believed that additional simulator
      training resulted in better surgeons. Moreover, none of the respondents would
      want their operation to be performed by a surgeon who had not trained on a
      simulator. Cronbach's alpha was 0.969. CONCLUSIONS: There is also a clear public 
      consensus for this method of training to be more widely utilised and it would
      enhance public perception of safer training of orthopaedic surgeons. This study
      of public perception provides a mandate to increase investment and infrastructure
      in orthopaedic simulation as part of promoting clinical governance.

TI  - Augmented reality-guided neurosurgery: accuracy and intraoperative application of
      an image projection technique.
PG  - 206-11
LID - 10.3171/2014.9.JNS141001 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: An augmented reality system has been developed for image-guided
      neurosurgery to project images with regions of interest onto the patient's head, 
      skull, or brain surface in real time. The aim of this study was to evaluate
      system accuracy and to perform the first intraoperative application. METHODS:
      Images of segmented brain tumors in different localizations and sizes were
      created in 10 cases and were projected to a head phantom using a video projector.
      Registration was performed using 5 fiducial markers. After each registration, the
      distance of the 5 fiducial markers from the visualized tumor borders was measured
      on the virtual image and on the phantom. The difference was considered a
      projection error. Moreover, the image projection technique was intraoperatively
      applied in 5 patients and was compared with a standard navigation system.
      RESULTS: Augmented reality visualization of the tumors succeeded in all cases.
      The mean time for registration was 3.8 minutes (range 2-7 minutes). The mean
      projection error was 0.8 +/- 0.25 mm. There were no significant differences in
      accuracy according to the localization and size of the tumor. Clinical
      feasibility and reliability of the augmented reality system could be proved
      intraoperatively in 5 patients (projection error 1.2 +/- 0.54 mm). CONCLUSIONS:
      The augmented reality system is accurate and reliable for the intraoperative
      projection of images to the head, skull, and brain surface. The ergonomic
      advantage of this technique improves the planning of neurosurgical procedures and
      enables the surgeon to use direct visualization for image-guided neurosurgery.

TI  - Simulation-based certification for cataract surgery.
PG  - 416-21
LID - 10.1111/aos.12691 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the EyeSi() simulator in regard to assessing competence in
      cataract surgery. The primary objective was to explore all simulator metrics to
      establish a proficiency-based test with solid evidence. The secondary objective
      was to evaluate whether the skill assessment was specific to cataract surgery.
      METHODS: We included 26 ophthalmic trainees (no cataract surgery experience), 11 
      experienced cataract surgeons (>4000 cataract procedures) and five vitreoretinal 
      surgeons. All subjects completed 13 different modules twice. Simulator metrics
      were used for the assessments. RESULTS: Total module score on seven of 13 modules
      showed significant discriminative ability between the novices and experienced
      cataract surgeons. The intermodule reliability coefficient was 0.76 (p < 0.001). 
      A pass/fail level was defined from the total score on these seven modules using
      the contrasting-groups method. The test had an overall ability to discriminate
      between novices and experienced cataract surgeons, as 21 of 26 novices (81%)
      versus one of 11 experienced surgeons (9%) did not pass the test. The
      vitreoretinal surgeons scored significantly higher than the novices (p = 0.006), 
      but not significantly lower than the experienced cataract surgeons (p = 0.32).
      CONCLUSION: We have established a performance test, consisting of seven modules
      on the EyeSi() simulator, which possess evidence of validity. The test is a
      useful and reliable tool for assessment of both cataract surgical and general
      microsurgical skills in vitro.

TI  - Validation of a patient-specific simulator for laparoscopic renal surgery.
PG  - 572-6
LID - 10.1111/iju.12737 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe and to validate a novel patient-specific virtual-reality 
      based simulator for laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: Three surgeons carried out 13 
      preoperative simulations at Yokohama City University Hospital, Yokohama,
      Kanagawa, Japan, from 2011 to 2012. The procedures included seven nephrectomies, 
      four partial nephrectomies and two pyeloplasties. We evaluated whether the
      anatomies reproduced by the simulator matched those encountered during the actual
      operations. Furthermore, the surgeons were asked to use visual analog scales
      (from 1 to 5; higher scores are better) to evaluate the anatomical integrity and 
      utility of the simulations, and their intraoperative confidence during the
      subsequent surgical procedures. RESULTS: The simulator reproduced the patients'
      anatomies almost perfectly. Only a few minor mistakes were identified. Regarding 
      the surgeons' evaluations of the system, the mean scores for the anatomical
      integrity and utility of the simulations, and the surgeons' intraoperative
      confidence were 3.4, 4.2 and 4.1, respectively. In all 13 cases, the surgeons
      were able to carry out preoperative training with ease, and they stated that the 
      simulator was useful for producing preoperative images. CONCLUSIONS: A
      patient-specific simulator for laparoscopic renal surgery has been successfully
      developed. This system correctly reproduces anatomical structures, and it seems
      to be a useful preoperative training tool.

TI  - [The interactive neuroanatomical simulation and practical application of
      frontotemporal transsylvian exposure in neurosurgery].
PG  - 376-83
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is an increased need for new digital education
      tools in neurosurgical training. Illustrated textbooks offer anatomic and
      technical reference but do not substitute hands-on experience provided by surgery
      or cadaver dissection. Due to limited availability of cadaver dissections the
      need for development of simulation tools has been augmented. We explored
      simulation technology for producing virtual reality-like reconstructions of
      simulated surgical approaches on cadaver. Practical application of the simulation
      tool has been presented through frontotemporal transsylvian exposure. METHODS:
      The dissections were performed on two cadaveric heads. Arteries and veins were
      prepared and injected with colorful silicon rubber. The heads were rigidly fixed 
      in Mayfield headholder. A robotic microscope with two digital cameras in inverted
      cone method of image acquisition was used to capture images around a pivot point 
      in several phases of dissections. Multilayered, high-resolution images have been 
      built into interactive 4D environment by custom developed software. RESULTS: We
      have developed the simulation module of the frontotemporal transsylvian approach.
      The virtual specimens can be rotated or tilted to any selected angles and
      examined from different surgical perspectives at any stage of dissections.
      Important surgical issues such as appropriate head positioning or surgical
      maneuvers to expose deep situated neuroanatomic structures can be simulated and
      studied by using the module. CONCLUSION: The simulation module of the
      frontotemporal transsylvian exposure helps to examine effect of head positioning 
      on the visibility of deep situated neuroanatomic structures and study surgical
      maneuvers required to achieve optimal exposure of deep situated anatomic
      structures. The simulation program is a powerful tool to study issues of
      preoperative planning and well suited for neurosurgical training.

TI  - A virtual reality-based method of decreasing transmission time of visual feedback
      for a tele-operative robotic catheter operating system.
LID - 10.1002/rcs.1642 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An Internet-based tele-operative robotic catheter operating system
      was designed for vascular interventional surgery, to afford unskilled surgeons
      the opportunity to learn basic catheter/guidewire skills, while allowing
      experienced physicians to perform surgeries cooperatively. Remote surgical
      procedures, limited by variable transmission times for visual feedback, have been
      associated with deterioration in operability and vascular wall damage during
      surgery. METHODS: At the patient's location, the catheter shape/position was
      detected in real time and converted into three-dimensional coordinates in a world
      coordinate system. At the operation location, the catheter shape was
      reconstructed in a virtual-reality environment, based on the coordinates
      received. The data volume reduction significantly reduced visual feedback
      transmission times. RESULTS: Remote transmission experiments, conducted over
      inter-country distances, demonstrated the improved performance of the proposed
      prototype. The maximum error for the catheter shape reconstruction was 0.93 mm
      and the transmission time was reduced considerably. CONCLUSIONS: The results were
      positive and demonstrate the feasibility of remote surgery using conventional
      network infrastructures. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In the last three decades, simulation has become a key tool in the training of
      doctors and the maintenance of patient safety. Simulation offers an immersive,
      realistic way of learning technical skills. Recent changes to the training
      schemes in many surgical specialities mean that the hours spent working between
      senior house officer and consultant have been reduced. This, combined with other 
      pressures (such as reduced operating hours), means that surgery has moved away
      from its traditional apprenticeship model and toward a competency-based one.
      Simulation can be a standardized and safe method for training and assessing
      surgeons. Use of simulation for training has become significant alongside the
      development of laparoscopic techniques, and evidence suggests that skills
      obtained in simulation are applicable in real clinical scenarios. Simulation
      allows trainees to make mistakes, to ask the "what if?" questions, and to learn
      and reflect on such situations without risking patient safety. Virtual reality
      simulators have been used to allow experts to plan complicated operations and
      assess perioperative risks. Most recently, fully immersive simulations, such as
      those with whole theater teams involved, and patient-centered simulations allow
      development of other key skills aside from purely technical ones. Use of
      simulation in isolation from traditional teaching methods will furnish the
      surgeon in training with skills, but the best time and place to use such skills
      comes only with experience. In this article we examine the role of simulation in 
      surgical training and its impact in the context of reduced training time.

AB  - We implemented a virtual reality system to quantify differences in the use of
      visual feedback to maintain balance during walking between healthy young (n=12,
      mean age: 24 years) and healthy old (n=11, 71 years) adults. Subjects walked on a
      treadmill while watching a speed-matched, virtual hallway with and without
      mediolateral visual perturbations. A motion capture system tracked center of mass
      (CoM) motion and foot kinematics. Spectral analysis, detrended fluctuation
      analysis, and local divergence exponents quantified old and young adults' dynamic
      response to visual perturbations. Old and young adults walked normally with
      comparable CoM spectral characteristics, lateral step placement temporal
      persistence, and local divergence exponents. Perturbed visual flow induced
      significantly larger changes in mediolateral CoM motion in old vs. young adults. 
      Moreover, visual perturbations disrupted the control of lateral step placement
      and compromised local dynamic stability more significantly in old than young
      adults. Advanced age induces a greater reliance on visual feedback to maintain
      balance during waking, an effect that may compensate for degradations in
      somatosensation. Our findings are relevant to the early diagnosis of
      sensory-induced balance impairments and also point to the potential use of
      virtual reality to evaluate sensory rehabilitation and balance training programs 
      for old adults.

TI  - Developing effective automated feedback in temporal bone surgery simulation.
PG  - 1082-8
LID - 10.1177/0194599815570880 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to test the effectiveness, accuracy, and usefulness of an
      automated feedback system in facilitating skill acquisition in virtual reality
      surgery. STUDY DESIGN: We evaluate the performance of the feedback system through
      a randomized controlled trial of 24 students allocated to feedback and
      nonfeedback groups. SETTING: The feedback system was based on the Melbourne
      University temporal bone surgery simulator. The study was conducted at the
      simulation laboratory of the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, Melbourne.
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study participants were medical students from the
      University of Melbourne, who were asked to perform virtual cortical mastoidectomy
      on the simulator. The extent to which the drilling behavior of the feedback and
      nonfeedback groups differed was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system.
      Its accuracy was determined through a postexperiment observational assessment of 
      recordings made during the experiment by an expert surgeon. Its usability was
      evaluated using students' self-reports of their impressions of the system.
      RESULTS: A Friedman's test showed that there was a significant improvement in the
      drilling performance of the feedback group, chi(2)(1) = 14.450, P < .001. The
      postexperiment assessment demonstrated that the system provided timely feedback
      (when trainee behavior was detected) 88.6% of the time and appropriate feedback
      (accurate advice) 84.2% of the time. Participants' opinions about the usefulness 
      of the system were highly positive. CONCLUSION: The automated feedback system was
      observed to be effective in improving surgical technique, and the provided
      feedback was found to be accurate and useful.

TI  - The use of a virtual reality surgical simulator for cataract surgical skill
      assessment with 6 months of intervening operating room experience.
PG  - 141-9
LID - 10.2147/OPTH.S69970 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate a haptic-based simulator, MicroVisTouch, as an assessment
      tool for capsulorhexis performance in cataract surgery. The study is a
      prospective, unmasked, nonrandomized dual academic institution study conducted at
      the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins Medical Center (Baltimore, MD, USA) and
      King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). METHODS: This
      prospective study evaluated capsulorhexis simulator performance in 78
      ophthalmology residents in the US and Saudi Arabia in the first round of testing 
      and 40 residents in a second round for follow-up. RESULTS: Four variables
      (circularity, accuracy, fluency, and overall) were tested by the simulator and
      graded on a 0-100 scale. Circularity (42%), accuracy (55%), and fluency (3%) were
      compiled to give an overall score. Capsulorhexis performance was retested in the 
      original cohort 6 months after baseline assessment. Average scores in all
      measured metrics demonstrated statistically significant improvement (except for
      circularity, which trended toward improvement) after baseline assessment. A
      reduction in standard deviation and improvement in process capability indices
      over the 6-month period was also observed. CONCLUSION: An interval objective
      improvement in capsulorhexis skill on a haptic-enabled cataract surgery simulator
      was associated with intervening operating room experience. Further work
      investigating the role of formalized simulator training programs requiring
      independent simulator use must be studied to determine its usefulness as an
      evaluation tool.

TI  - Simulation-based training for colonoscopy: establishing criteria for competency.
PG  - e440
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000000440 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to create simulation-based tests with credible
      pass/fail standards for 2 different fidelities of colonoscopy models. Only
      competent practitioners should perform colonoscopy. Reliable and valid
      simulation-based tests could be used to establish basic competency in colonoscopy
      before practicing on patients. Twenty-five physicians (10 consultants with
      endoscopic experience and 15 fellows with very little endoscopic experience) were
      tested on 2 different simulator models: a virtual-reality simulator and a
      physical model. Tests were repeated twice on each simulator model. Metrics with
      discriminatory ability were identified for both modalities and reliability was
      determined. The contrasting-groups method was used to create pass/fail standards 
      and the consequences of these were explored. The consultants significantly
      performed faster and scored higher than the fellows on both the models (P <
      0.001). Reliability analysis showed Cronbach alpha = 0.80 and 0.87 for the
      virtual-reality and the physical model, respectively. The established pass/fail
      standards failed one of the consultants (virtual-reality simulator) and allowed
      one fellow to pass (physical model). The 2 tested simulations-based modalities
      provided reliable and valid assessments of competence in colonoscopy and credible
      pass/fail standards were established for both the tests. We propose to use these 
      standards in simulation-based training programs before proceeding to supervised
      training on patients.

TI  - Intraoperative fluorescence-based enhanced reality laparoscopic real-time imaging
      to assess bowel perfusion at the anastomotic site in an experimental model.
PG  - e169-76
LID - 10.1002/bjs.9725 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluorescence videography is a promising technique for assessing bowel
      perfusion. Fluorescence-based enhanced reality (FLER) is a novel concept, in
      which a dynamic perfusion cartogram, generated by computer analysis, is
      superimposed on to real-time laparoscopic images. The aim of this experimental
      study was to assess the accuracy of FLER in detecting differences in perfusion in
      a small bowel resection-anastomosis model. METHODS: A small bowel ischaemic
      segment was created laparoscopically in 13 pigs. Animals were allocated to having
      anastomoses performed at either low perfusion (25 per cent; n = 7) or high
      perfusion (75 per cent; n = 6), as determined by FLER analysis. Capillary lactate
      levels were measured in blood samples obtained by serosal puncturing in the
      ischaemic area, resection lines and vascularized areas. Pathological inflammation
      scoring of the anastomosis was carried out. RESULTS: Lactate levels in the
      ischaemic area (mean(s.d.) 5.6(2.8) mmol/l) were higher than those in resection
      lines at 25 per cent perfusion (3.7(1.7) mmol/l; P = 0.010) and 75 per cent
      perfusion (2.9(1.3) mmol/l; P < 0.001), and higher than levels in vascular zones 
      (2.5(1.0) mmol/l; P < 0.001). Lactate levels in resection lines with 75 per cent 
      perfusion were lower than those in lines with 25 per cent perfusion (P < 0.001), 
      and similar to those in vascular zones (P = 0.188). Levels at resection lines
      with 25 per cent perfusion were higher than those in vascular zones (P = 0.001). 
      Mean(s.d.) global inflammation scores were higher in the 25 per cent perfusion
      group compared with the 75 per cent perfusion group for mucosa/submucosa
      (2.1(0.4) versus 1.2(0.4); P = 0.003) and serosa (1.8(0.4) versus 0.8(0.8); P =
      0.014). A ratio of preanastomotic lactate levels in the ischaemic area relative
      to the resection lines of 2 or less was predictive of a more severe inflammation 
      score. CONCLUSION: In an experimental model, FLER appeared accurate in
      discriminating bowel perfusion levels. Surgical relevance Clinical assessment has
      limited accuracy in evaluating bowel perfusion before anastomosis. Fluorescence
      videography estimates intestinal perfusion based on the fluorescence intensity of
      injected fluorophores, which is proportional to bowel vascularization. However,
      evaluation of fluorescence intensity remains a static and subjective measure.
      Fluorescence-based enhanced reality (FLER) is a dynamic fluorescence videography 
      technique integrating near-infrared endoscopy and specific software. The software
      generates a virtual perfusion cartogram based on time to peak fluorescence, which
      can be superimposed on to real-time laparoscopic images. This experimental study 
      demonstrates the accuracy of FLER in detecting differences in bowel perfusion in 
      a survival model of laparoscopic small bowel resection-anastomosis, based on
      biochemical and histopathological data. It is concluded that real-time imaging of
      bowel perfusion is easy to use and accurate, and should be translated into
      clinical use.

AB  - Lipodystrophy is a pathological condition characterized by the focal or general
      absence of adipose tissue. Surgeons reset the patient's surface contours using
      injectable materials to recreate a normal physical appearance. However, due to
      difficulties in preoperative planning and intraoperative assessment, about 15% of
      the surgical procedures involved are reinterventions to improve volume or
      symmetry. This increases the need for an available, efficient tool capable of
      providing the surgeon with a good estimation of the volumes to be injected before
      the intervention proper begins. This work describes a virtual reality-based
      application for the surgical planning of facial lipodystrophy correction (FLIC). 
      The tool uses points selected interactively by the surgeon to compute a curve
      that delimits the surface area to be operated on. It then automatically computes 
      an estimated natural reconstructed surface and the quantity of volume that needs 
      to be implanted during the intervention. Experiments have been carried out in
      which the filling volumes estimated using FLIC and ZBrush software were compared 
      with the real volumes injected by the surgeon. ICCs higher than 0.97 indicate
      that there were no significant differences between the respective measurements,
      thus validating the tool proposed in this paper.

PG  - 89-98; discussion 98
LID - 10.1227/NEU.0000000000000631 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Validated procedures to objectively measure neurosurgical bimanual
      psychomotor skills are unavailable. The NeuroTouch simulator provides metrics to 
      determine bimanual performance, but validation is essential before implementation
      of this platform into neurosurgical training, assessment, and curriculum
      development. OBJECTIVE: To develop, evaluate, and validate neurosurgical bimanual
      performance metrics for resection of simulated brain tumors with NeuroTouch.
      METHODS: Bimanual resection of 8 simulated brain tumors with differing color,
      stiffness, and border complexity was evaluated. Metrics assessed included blood
      loss, tumor percentage resected, total simulated normal brain volume removed,
      total tip path lengths, maximum and sum of forces used by instruments, efficiency
      index, ultrasonic aspirator path length index, coordination index, and ultrasonic
      aspirator bimanual forces ratio. Six neurosurgeons and 12 residents (6 senior and
      6 junior) were evaluated. RESULTS: Increasing tumor complexity impaired resident 
      bimanual performance significantly more than neurosurgeons. Operating on black vs
      glioma-colored tumors resulted in significantly higher blood loss and lower tumor
      percentage, whereas altering tactile cues from hard to soft decreased resident
      tumor resection. Regardless of tumor complexity, significant differences were
      found between neurosurgeons, senior residents, and junior residents in efficiency
      index and ultrasonic aspirator path length index. Ultrasonic aspirator bimanual
      force ratio outlined significant differences between senior and junior residents,
      whereas coordination index demonstrated significant differences between junior
      residents and neurosurgeons. CONCLUSION: The NeuroTouch platform incorporating
      the simulated scenarios and metrics used differentiates novice from expert
      neurosurgical performance, demonstrating NeuroTouch face, content, and construct 
      validity and the possibility of developing brain tumor resection proficiency
      performance benchmarks.

      feedback.
PG  - 52-8
LID - 10.1227/NEU.0000000000000583 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the decrease in the number of cerebral aneurysms treated
      surgically and the increase of complexity of those treated surgically, there is a
      need for simulation-based tools to teach future neurosurgeons the operative
      techniques of aneurysm clipping. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate the
      usefulness of a new haptic-based virtual reality simulator in the training of
      neurosurgical residents. METHODS: A real-time sensory haptic feedback virtual
      reality aneurysm clipping simulator was developed using the ImmersiveTouch
      platform. A prototype middle cerebral artery aneurysm simulation was created from
      a computed tomographic angiogram. Aneurysm and vessel volume deformation and
      haptic feedback are provided in a 3-dimensional immersive virtual reality
      environment. Intraoperative aneurysm rupture was also simulated. Seventeen
      neurosurgery residents from 3 residency programs tested the simulator and
      provided feedback on its usefulness and resemblance to real aneurysm clipping
      surgery. RESULTS: Residents thought that the simulation would be useful in
      preparing for real-life surgery. About two-thirds of the residents thought that
      the 3-dimensional immersive anatomic details provided a close resemblance to real
      operative anatomy and accurate guidance for deciding surgical approaches. They
      thought the simulation was useful for preoperative surgical rehearsal and
      neurosurgical training. A third of the residents thought that the technology in
      its current form provided realistic haptic feedback for aneurysm surgery.
      CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical residents thought that the novel immersive VR simulator
      is helpful in their training, especially because they do not get a chance to
      perform aneurysm clippings until late in their residency programs.

AB  - Surgery, interventional radiology, and advanced endoscopy have all developed
      minimally invasive techniques to effectively treat a variety of diseases with
      positive impact on patients' postoperative outcomes. However, those techniques
      are challenging and require extensive training. Robotics and computer sciences
      can help facilitate minimally invasive approaches. Furthermore, surgery, advanced
      endoscopy, and interventional radiology could converge towards a new hybrid
      specialty, hybrid image-guided minimally invasive therapies, in which the three
      fundamental disciplines could complement one another to maximize the positive
      effects and reduce the iatrogenic footprint on patients. The present manuscript
      describes the fundamental steps of this new paradigm shift in surgical therapies 
      that, in our opinion, will be the next revolutionary step in minimally invasive
      approaches.

TI  - Improved planning of endoscopic sinonasal surgery from 3-dimensional images with

LID - 10.1016/j.otorri.2014.10.002 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The high variability of sinonasal anatomy requires
      the best knowledge of its three-dimensional (3D) conformation to perform surgery 
      more safely and efficiently. The aim of the study was to validate the utility of 
      Osirix(R) and stereolithography in improving endoscopic sinonasal surgery
      planning. METHODS: Osirix(R) was used as a viewer and Digital Imaging and
      Communications in Medicine (DICOM) 3D imaging manager to improve planning for 114
      sinonasal endoscopic operations with polyposis (86) and chronic rhinosinusitis
      (CRS) (28). Stereolithography rapid prototyping was used for 7 frontoethmoidal
      mucoceles. RESULTS: Using Osirix(R) and stereolithography, a greater number of
      anatomical structures were identified and this was done faster, with a
      statistically-significant clinical-radiological correlation (P<.01) compared with
      2D CT plates. With a share of more than 75% of surgery performed by residents,
      surgical time was reduced by 38+/-12.3min in CRS and 42+/-27.9 in sinonasal
      polyposis. The fourth-year residents reached 100% surgical competence in critical
      surgical milestones with 16 surgeries (CI 12-19). CONCLUSIONS: The systematic use
      of Osirix(R) for visualisation and treatment of 3D sinonasal images from DICOM
      data files, along with the surgical team's ability to manipulate them as virtual 
      reality, allows surgeons to perform endoscopic sinonasal surgery with greater
      confidence and in less time than using 2D images. Residents also achieve surgical
      competence faster, more safely and with fewer complications. This beneficial
      impact is increased when the surgical team has stereolithography rapid
      prototyping in more complex cases.

TI  - A perspective on the role and utility of haptic feedback in laparoscopic skills
      training.
PG  - 293-318
AB  - Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive surgical technique with significant 
      potential benefits to the patient, including shorter recovery time, less
      scarring, and decreased costs. There is a growing need to teach surgical trainees
      this emerging surgical technique. Simulators, ranging from simple "box" trainers 
      to complex virtual reality (VR) trainers, have emerged as the most promising
      method for teaching basic laparoscopic surgical skills. Current box trainers
      require oversight from an expert surgeon for both training and assessing skills. 
      VR trainers decrease the dependence on expert teachers during training by
      providing objective, real-time feedback and automatic skills evaluation. However,
      current VR trainers generally have limited credibility as a means to prepare new 
      surgeons and have often fallen short of educators' expectations. Several
      researchers have speculated that the missing component in modern VR trainers is
      haptic feedback, which refers to the range of touch sensations encountered during
      surgery. These force types and ranges need to be adequately rendered by
      simulators for a more complete training experience. This article presents a
      perspective of the role and utility of haptic feedback during laparoscopic
      surgery and laparoscopic skills training by detailing the ranges and types of
      haptic sensations felt by the operating surgeon, along with quantitative studies 
      of how this feedback is used. Further, a number of research studies that have
      documented human performance effects as a result of the presence of haptic
      feedback are critically reviewed. Finally, key research directions in using
      haptic feedback for laparoscopy training simulators are identified.

LID - 10.1159/000369624 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To define a curriculum for the development of robotic surgical skills in
      otorhinolaryngology residency training. METHODS: A systematic review of the
      current literature on robotic surgery training was performed. Based on prior
      reports in other specialties, a curriculum for otorhinolaryngology residents was 
      created that progresses through several modules, including didactics, inanimate
      skills laboratory, and operative experience. RESULTS: The curriculum for
      residents in otorhinolaryngology was designed as follows: didactics include an
      overview of the robotic device and instruments, a tutorial in basic controls and 
      function, and a room setup and positioning. The anatomy and steps of transoral
      procedures are taught through books, videos, operative observations, and cadaver 
      dissections. Skills are developed with a virtual reality robotic simulator and
      robotics labs. The operative experience progresses from case observation to
      bedside assistant to console surgeon. The role of the console surgeon progresses 
      in a stepwise fashion, and the procedures of radical tonsillectomy, supraglottic 
      partial laryngectomy, and base of tongue resection have been organized as a
      series of steps. CONCLUSION: A structured curriculum for training residents in
      transoral robotic surgery was developed. This training is important for
      otorhinolaryngology residents to acquire the knowledge and skills to perform
      robotic surgery safely.

AB  - PHENOMENON: Virtual reality simulators are the subject of several recent studies 
      of skills training for robot-assisted surgery. Yet no consensus exists regarding 
      what a core skill set comprises or how to measure skill performance. Defining a
      core skill set and relevant metrics would help surgical educators evaluate
      different simulators. APPROACH: This review draws from published research to
      propose a core technical skill set for using the da Vinci surgeon console.
      Publications on three commercial simulators were used to evaluate the simulators'
      content addressing these skills and associated metrics. FINDINGS: An analysis of 
      published research suggests that a core technical skill set for operating the
      surgeon console includes bimanual wristed manipulation, camera control, master
      clutching to manage hand position, use of third instrument arm, activating energy
      sources, appropriate depth perception, and awareness of forces applied by
      instruments. Validity studies of three commercial virtual reality simulators for 
      robot-assisted surgery suggest that all three have comparable content and
      metrics. However, none have comprehensive content and metrics for all core
      skills. INSIGHTS: Virtual reality simulation remains a promising tool to support 
      skill training for robot-assisted surgery, yet existing commercial simulator
      content is inadequate for performing and assessing a comprehensive basic skill
      set. The results of this evaluation help identify opportunities and challenges
      that exist for future developments in virtual reality simulation for
      robot-assisted surgery. Specifically, the inclusion of educational experts in the
      development cycle alongside clinical and technological experts is recommended.

PG  - 158-62
LID - 10.1097/MOU.0000000000000139 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the most recent literature and contemporary role of 
      the use of porcine and chicken models in laparoscopic and robotic simulation
      exercises, for training and skill assessment. RECENT FINDINGS: There are multiple
      types of the simulators which include mechanical, virtual reality, hybrid
      simulators and animal models. The recent literature has seen insurgence of
      several of such simulators, specifically the animate ones comprising porcine and 
      chicken models. The different training models reported have evolved from
      generalized and simpler, to a more task dedicated and complex versions. Unlike in
      the past, the recent publications include analysis of these models incorporating 
      different measures of validity assessment. SUMMARY: On account of the natural
      tissue properties inherent to these porcine and chicken models, they are proving 
      to be instrumental in acquisition of higher surgical skills such as dissection,
      suturing and use of energy sources, all of which are required in real-time
      clinical scenarios be it laparoscopy or robotic-assisted procedures. In-vivo
      training in the animal model continues to be, perhaps, the most sophisticated
      training method before resorting to real-time surgery.

TI  - Role of transurethral resection of the prostate simulators for training in
      transurethral surgery.
PG  - 153-7
LID - 10.1097/MOU.0000000000000141 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Transurethral surgery is an art unique to urologists;
      mastering the craft is essential for day-to-day practice. Medical treatment along
      with minimally invasive treatments have significantly reduced the number of
      transurethral resection of prostates. Decrease in resident's training hours,
      expanding subspecialties and the emergence of newer technologies have burdened
      the trainees who are trying to digest the ever-expanding medical literature.
      Moreover, expectations from patients and insurance companies with a stress on
      cutting costs and raising litigations have brought changes in apprentice-based to
      simulator-based training. We studied the role of transurethral resection of
      prostate simulators in training of transurethral surgery. RECENT FINDINGS: TURP
      simulators from bench to virtual reality computer models are available. Most of
      them have undergone face, content and construct validity. Nontechnical skills
      training is also important hence simulation to simulator training. Simulation
      programmes incorporating communication, team building, minimizing errors caused
      by distraction and managing complex situations can turn a novice into an expert
      with adequate practice in a stress-free environment. Work is also done to define 
      learning curve, and factors affecting the path to reach the desired goal.
      Concepts are emerging to integrate simulators and simulation into the existing
      training programmes. SUMMARY: TURP simulators are essential for training in
      transurethral surgery. Low or high-fidelity simulators do not matter, but having 
      a well structured simulation programme, under the scrutiny of a dedicated trained
      faculty, will address most of the issues related to training in transurethral
      surgery, an art essential for urologists irrespective of the subspecialty one
      pursues in the future.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of the current status of
      simulator systems in robotic surgery training curriculum, focusing on available
      simulators for training, their comparison, new technologies introduced in
      simulation focusing on concepts of training along with existing challenges and
      future perspectives of simulator training in robotic surgery. RECENT FINDINGS:
      The different virtual reality simulators available in the market like dVSS, dVT, 
      RoSS, ProMIS and SEP have shown face, content and construct validity in robotic
      skills training for novices outside the operating room. Recently, augmented
      reality simulators like HoST, Maestro AR and RobotiX Mentor have been introduced 
      in robotic training providing a more realistic operating environment, emphasizing
      more on procedure-specific robotic training . Further, the Xperience Team
      Trainer, which provides training to console surgeon and bed-side assistant
      simultaneously, has been recently introduced to emphasize the importance of
      teamwork and proper coordination. SUMMARY: Simulator training holds an important 
      place in current robotic training curriculum of future robotic surgeons. There is
      a need for more procedure-specific augmented reality simulator training,
      utilizing advancements in computing and graphical capabilities for new
      innovations in simulator technology. Further studies are required to establish
      its cost-benefit ratio along with concurrent and predictive validity.

AB  - Surgical navigation describes the concept of real-time processing and
      presentation of preoperative and intraoperative data from different sources to
      intraoperatively provide surgeons with additional cognitive support. Imaging
      methods such as 3D ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed
      tomography (CT) and data from optical, electromagnetic or mechanical tracking
      methods are used. The resulting information of the navigation system will be
      presented by the means of visual methods. Mostly virtual reality or augmented
      reality visualization is used. There are different guidance systems for various
      disciplines introduced. Mostly it operates on rigid structures (bone, brain). For
      soft tissue navigation motion compensation and deformation detection are
      necessary. Therefore, marker-based tracking methods are used in several
      urological application examples; however, the systems are often still under
      development and have not yet arrived in the clinical routine.

TI  - When experts are oceans apart: comparing expert performance values for
      proficiency-based laparoscopic simulator training.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical training is moving away from the operating room toward
      simulation-based skills training facilities. This has led to the development of
      proficiency-based training courses in which expert performance data are used for 
      feedback and assessment. However, few expert value data sets have been published,
      and no standard method for generating expert values has been adopted by the
      field. METHODS: To investigate the effect of different proficiency value data
      sets on simulator training courses, we (1) compared 2 published expert
      performance data sets for the LapSim laparoscopic virtual-reality simulator (by
      van Dongen et al. and Heinrichs et al.) and (2) assessed the effect of using
      either set on LapSim training data obtained from 16 local residents in surgery
      and gynecology. RESULTS: Across all simulator tasks, the experts consulted by van
      Dongen et al. performed better on motion efficiency, but not on duration or
      damage control. Applying both proficiency sets to training data collected during 
      a basic skills laparoscopic simulator course, residents would have graduated on
      an average in 1.5 fewer sessions using the Heinrichs expert values compared with 
      the van Dongen expert values. CONCLUSIONS: The selection of proficiency values
      for proficiency-based simulator training courses affects training length, skills 
      level assessment, and training costs. Standardized, well-controlled methods are
      necessary to create valid and reliable expert values for use in training and
      research.

AB  - Endovascular surgery is performed by placing a catheter through blood vessels.
      Due to the fragility of arteries and the difficulty in controlling a long elastic
      wire to reach the target region, training plays an extremely important role in
      helping a surgeon acquire the required complex skills. Virtual reality simulators
      and augmented reality systems have proven to be effective in minimally invasive
      surgical training. These systems, however, often employ pre-captured or
      computer-generated medical images. We have developed an augmented reality system 
      for ultrasound-guided endovascular surgical training, where real ultrasound
      images captured during the procedure are registered with a pre-scanned phantom
      model to give the operator a realistic experience. Our goal is to extend the
      planning and training environment to deliver a system for computer assisted
      remote endovascular surgery where the navigation of a catheter can be controlled 
      through a robotic device based on the guidance provided by an endovascular
      surgeon.

AB  - Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is a minimally invasive
      procedure, which utilizes the body's natural orifices to gain access to the
      peritoneal cavity. The VTEST((c)) is a virtual reality NOTES simulator developed 
      at the CeMSIM at RPI to train surgeons in NOTES. A novel 2 DOF decoupled haptic
      device was designed and built for this simulator. The haptic device can render
      5.62 N and 190.05 N-mm of continuous force and torque respectively. In this work 
      we have evaluated the haptic interface and developed a model to accurately
      describe the system behavior, to further incorporate into an impedance type
      controller for realistic haptic rendering in the VTEST((c)).

TI  - A 3D virtual reality simulator for training of minimally invasive surgery.
PG  - 349-52
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943601 [doi]
AB  - For the last decade, remarkable progress has been made in the field of
      cardiovascular disease treatment. However, these complex medical procedures
      require a combination of rich experience and technical skills. In this paper, a
      3D virtual reality simulator for core skills training in minimally invasive
      surgery is presented. The system can generate realistic 3D vascular models
      segmented from patient datasets, including a beating heart, and provide a
      real-time computation of force and force feedback module for surgical simulation.
      Instruments, such as a catheter or guide wire, are represented by a multi-body
      mass-spring model. In addition, a realistic user interface with multiple windows 
      and real-time 3D views are developed. Moreover, the simulator is also provided
      with a human-machine interaction module that gives doctors the sense of touch
      during the surgery training, enables them to control the motion of a virtual
      catheter/guide wire inside a complex vascular model. Experimental results show
      that the simulator is suitable for minimally invasive surgery training.

TI  - Porcine cadaver organ or virtual-reality simulation training for laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy: a randomized, controlled trial.

LID - 10.1016/j.jsurg.2014.11.015 [doi]
LID - S1931-7204(14)00317-1 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: As conventional laparoscopic procedural training requires live
      animals or cadaver organs, virtual simulation seems an attractive alternative.
      Therefore, we compared the transfer of training for the laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy from porcine cadaver organs vs virtual simulation to surgery in a
      live animal model in a prospective randomized trial. DESIGN: After completing an 
      intensive training in basic laparoscopic skills, 3 groups of 10 participants
      proceeded with no additional training (control group), 5 hours of cholecystectomy
      training on cadaver organs (= organ training) or proficiency-based
      cholecystectomy training on the LapMentor (= virtual-reality training).
      Participants were evaluated on time and quality during a laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy on a live anaesthetized pig at baseline, 1 week (= post) and 4
      months (= retention) after training. SETTING: All research was performed in the
      Center for Surgical Technologies, Leuven, Belgium. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 30
      volunteering medical students without prior experience in laparoscopy or
      minimally invasive surgery from the University of Leuven (Belgium). RESULTS: The 
      organ training group performed the procedure significantly faster than the
      virtual trainer and borderline significantly faster than control group at
      posttesting. Only 1 of 3 expert raters suggested significantly better quality of 
      performance of the organ training group compared with both the other groups at
      posttesting (p < 0.01). There were no significant differences between groups at
      retention testing. The virtual trainer group did not outperform the control group
      at any time. CONCLUSIONS: For trainees who are proficient in basic laparoscopic
      skills, the long-term advantage of additional procedural training, especially on 
      a virtual but also on the conventional organ training model, remains to be
      proven.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: With aging, the sensory systems suffer an accumulation of
      degenerative, infectious and/or traumatic processes that may hinder the body
      balance maintenance. OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of sensory information on
      static body balance of elderly individuals with vestibular disorders. METHODS:
      Cross-sectional study of elderly individuals with vestibular disorders. The
      Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance and posturography integrated
      with virtual reality (Balance Rehabilitation Unit) were used. Posturography
      parameters analyzed included center of pressure and velocity of body sway.
      RESULTS: 123 individuals with mean age of 73.11 were assessed. Worst performance 
      was observed in the Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance condition of
      visual dome-unstable surface. Differences between conditions were: firm
      surface-open eyes/firm surface-closed eyes, unstable surface-open eyes/unstable
      surface-closed eyes (p<0.001), and unstable surface-closed eyes/unstable
      surface-visual dome. Considering center of pressure and velocity of body sway,
      significant differences were observed between the following conditions: firm
      surface-open eyes/firm surface-closed eyes: firm surface-saccadic stimulus/firm
      surface-vertical optokinetic stimulus; firm surface-optokinetic stimuli/firm
      surface-visual-vestibular interaction; and firm surface-visual-vestibular
      interaction/unstable surface. Worse performances were observed in conditions firm
      surface-closed eyes, firm surface-vertical optokinetic stimulus,
      F-visual-vestibular interaction, and unstable surface-closed eyes. There was a
      difference in the center of pressure between firm surface-closed eyes/firm
      surface-saccadic stimulus, with a worse performance in the condition of firm
      surface-closed eyes, and of velocity of body sway, between firm surface-saccadic 
      stimulus/firm surface-horizontal optokinetic stimulus (p<0.001). CONCLUSION:
      Static body balance in elderly individuals with vestibular disorders is worse
      when the sensory conditions are more challenging, i.e. stable and unstable
      surfaces, visual stimuli, such as optokinetic and visual-vestibular interaction, 
      and with the eyes closed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of simulation-based training between the Mimic
      dV- Trainer and traditional dry lab da Vinci robot training. DESIGN: A
      prospective randomized study analyzing the performance of 20 robotics-naive
      participants. Participants were enrolled in an online da Vinci Intuitive Surgical
      didactic training module, followed by training in use of the da Vinci standard
      surgical robot. Spatial ability tests were performed as well. Participants were
      randomly assigned to 1 of 2 training conditions: performance of 3 Fundamentals of
      Laparoscopic Surgery dry lab tasks using the da Vinci or performance of 4
      dV-Trainer tasks. Participants in both groups performed all tasks to empirically 
      establish proficiency criterion. Participants then performed the transfer task, a
      cystotomy closure using the daVinci robot on a live animal (swine) model. The
      performance of robotic tasks was blindly assessed by a panel of experienced
      surgeons using objective tracking data and using the validated Global Evaluative 
      Assessment of Robotic Surgery (GEARS), a structured assessment tool. RESULTS: No 
      statistically significant difference in surgeon performance was found between the
      2 training conditions, dV-Trainer and da Vinci robot. Analysis of a 95%
      confidence interval for the difference in means (-0.803 to 0.543) indicated that 
      the 2 methods are unlikely to differ to an extent that would be clinically
      meaningful. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, a curriculum on the
      dV- Trainer was shown to be comparable to traditional da Vinci robot training.
      Therefore, we have identified that training on a virtual reality system may be an
      alternative to live animal training for future robotic surgeons.

      effective in surgical training. METHODS: Fourteen residents were randomized into 
      deliberate practice (n = 7) or control training (n = 7). Both groups performed
      ten sessions of two VR LCs. Each session, the DP group was assigned 30 min of DP 
      activities in between LCs while the control group viewed educational videos or
      read journal articles. Performance was assessed on speed and dexterity; quality
      was rated with global (GRS) and procedure-specific (PSRS) rating scales. All
      participants then performed five porcine LCs. RESULTS: Both groups improved over 
      20 VR LCs in time, dexterity, and global rating scales (all p < 0.05). After 20
      LCs, there were no differences in speed or dexterity between groups. The DP group
      achieved higher quality of VR surgical performance than control for GRS (26 vs.
      20, p = 0.001) and PSRS (18 vs. 15, p = 0.001). For VR cases, DP subjects
      plateaued at GRS = 25 after ten cases and control group at GRS = 20 after five
      cases. At completion of VR training, 100 % of the DP group reached target quality
      of performance (GRS >/= 21) compared with 30 % in the control group. There were
      no significant differences for improvements in time or dexterity over five
      porcine LCs. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that DP leads to higher quality
      performance in VR LC than standard training alone. Standard training may leave
      individuals in a state of "arrested development" compared with DP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The overlay of virtual images on the surgical field, defined as
      augmented reality, has been used for image guidance during various neurosurgical 
      procedures. Although this technology could conceivably address certain inherent
      problems of extracranial-to-intracranial bypass procedures, this potential has
      not been explored to date. We evaluate the usefulness of an augmented
      reality-based setup, which could help in harvesting donor vessels through their
      precise localization in real-time, in performing tailored craniotomies, and in
      identifying preoperatively selected recipient vessels for the purpose of
      anastomosis. METHODS: Our method was applied to 3 patients with Moya-Moya disease
      who underwent superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery anastomoses
      and 1 patient who underwent an occipital artery-to-posteroinferior cerebellar
      artery bypass because of a dissecting aneurysm of the vertebral artery. Patients'
      heads, skulls, and extracranial and intracranial vessels were segmented
      preoperatively from 3-dimensional image data sets (3-dimensional digital
      subtraction angiography, angio-magnetic resonance imaging, angio-computed
      tomography), and injected intraoperatively into the operating microscope's
      eyepiece for image guidance. RESULTS: In each case, the described setup helped in
      precisely localizing donor and recipient vessels and in tailoring craniotomies to
      the injected images. CONCLUSIONS: The presented system based on augmented reality
      can optimize the workflow of extracranial-to-intracranial bypass procedures by
      providing essential anatomical information, entirely integrated to the surgical
      field, and help to perform minimally invasive procedures.

AB  - Changing patterns of health care delivery and the rapid evolution of orthopaedic 
      surgical techniques have made it increasingly difficult for trainees to develop
      expertise in their craft. Working hour restrictions and a drive towards senior
      led care demands that proficiency be gained in a shorter period of time whilst
      requiring a greater skill set than that in the past. The resulting conflict
      between service provision and training has necessitated the development of
      alternative methods in order to compensate for the reduction in 'hands-on'
      experience. Simulation training provides the opportunity to develop surgical
      skills in a controlled environment whilst minimising risks to patient safety,
      operating theatre usage and financial expenditure. Many options for simulation
      exist within orthopaedics from cadaveric or prosthetic models, to arthroscopic
      simulators, to advanced virtual reality and three-dimensional software tools.
      There are limitations to this form of training, but it has significant potential 
      for trainees to achieve competence in procedures prior to real-life practice. The
      evidence for its direct transferability to operating theatre performance is
      limited but there are clear benefits such as increasing trainee confidence and
      familiarity with equipment. With progressively improving methods of simulation
      available, it is likely to become more important in the ongoing and future
      training and assessment of orthopaedic surgeons.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report our clinical experience with an advanced navigation protocol
      that provides seamless integration into the operating workflow of endoscopic
      transsphenoidal surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 32 consecutive cases of
      endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery, an optimal setup of continuous
      electromagnetic instrument navigation was created. Additionally, our standard
      multimodality image navigation of T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images for 
      soft tissue, MR angiogram for vascular structures, and computed tomography (CT)
      for solid bone was advanced by the addition of a CT surface rendering for fine
      paranasal sinus structures. The anatomic structures visualized and their clinical
      impacts were compared between standard and advanced visualization protocol.
      Bone-windowed CT images served as reference. The accuracy of the navigation setup
      was assessed by intraoperative landmark tests. Potential tissue shift was
      calculated by comparing pre- and postoperative MR angiograms of 20 macroadenomas.
      RESULTS: After a learning curve of 2 cases (1 ferromagnetic interference and 1
      dislocation of the patient reference tracker), the advanced navigation protocol
      was feasible in 30 cases. Advanced multimodality imaging was able to visualize
      significantly finer paranasal sinus structures than multimodality image
      navigation without CT surface rendering, equal to bone-windowed CT images (P <
      0.001, McNemar test). This was found helpful for orientation in cases of complex 
      sphenoid sinus anatomy. The accuracy of the advanced navigation setup
      corresponded to standard optic navigation with skull fixation. A tissue shift of 
      median 2 mm (range 0-9 mm) was observed in the posterior genu of the internal
      carotid arteries after tumor resection. CONCLUSIONS: The advanced navigation
      protocol permits continuous suction-tracked navigation guidance during endoscopic
      transsphenoidal surgery and optimal visualization of solid bone, fine paranasal
      sinus structures, soft-tissue and vascular structures. This may add to the safety
      of the procedure especially in cases of anatomical variations and in cases of
      recurrent adenomas with distorted anatomy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Robotic surgery is a rapidly expanding field. Thus far training for
      robotic techniques has been unstructured and the requirements are variable across
      various regions. Several projects are currently underway to develop a robotic
      surgery curriculum and are in various stages of validation. We aimed to outline
      the structures of available curricula, their process of development, validation
      status and current utilization. METHODS: We undertook a literature review of
      papers including the MeSH terms "Robotics" and "Education". When we had an
      overview of curricula in development, we searched recent conference abstracts to 
      gain up to date information. RESULTS: The main curricula are the FRS, the FSRS,
      the Canadian BSTC and the ERUS initiative. They are in various stages of
      validation and offer a mixture of theoretical and practical training, using both 
      physical and simulated models. DISCUSSION: Whilst the FSRS is based on tasks on
      the RoSS virtual reality simulator, FRS and BSTC are designed for use on
      simulators and the robot itself. The ERUS curricula benefits from a combination
      of dry lab, wet lab and virtual reality components, which may allow skills to be 
      more transferable to the OR as tasks are completed in several formats. Finally,
      the ERUS curricula includes the OR modular training programme as table assistant 
      and console surgeon. CONCLUSION: Curricula are a crucial step in global
      standardisation of training and certification of surgeons for robotic surgical
      procedures. Many curricula are in early stages of development and more work is
      needed in development and validation of these programmes before training can be
      standardised.

AB  - Atherosclerotic plaque rupture is responsible for the majority of myocardial
      infarctions, with ruptured plaques exhibiting specific morphological features,
      including large lipid cores, thinner overlying fibrous caps and
      micro-calcifications. Contemporary imaging modalities are increasingly able to
      characterize plaques, potentially leading to the identification of precursor
      lesions that are at high risk of rupture. Observational studies using invasive
      imaging consistently find that plaques responsible for an acute coronary event
      display these high-risk morphological features, and recent prospective imaging
      studies have now established links between baseline plaque characteristics and
      future cardiovascular events. Despite these promising advances, subsequent
      overall event rates remain too low for clinical utility. Novel technologies are
      now required to refine and improve our ability to identify and risk-stratify
      lesions at risk of rupture, if plaque-based risk evaluation is ever to become
      reality.

AB  - Virtual reality simulators provide basic skills training without supervision in a
      controlled environment, free of pressure of operating on patients. Skills
      obtained through virtual reality simulation training can be transferred on the
      operating room. However, relative evidence is limited with data available only
      for basic surgical skills and for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. No data exist on 
      the effect of virtual reality simulation on performance on advanced surgical
      procedures. Evidence suggests that performance on virtual reality simulators
      reliably distinguishes experienced from novice surgeons Limited available data
      suggest that independent approach on virtual reality simulation training is not
      different from proctored approach. The effect of virtual reality simulators
      training on acquisition of basic surgical skills does not seem to be different
      from the effect the physical simulators. Limited data exist on the effect of
      virtual reality simulation training on the acquisition of visual spatial
      perception and stress coping skills. Undoubtedly, virtual reality simulation
      training provides an alternative means of improving performance in laparoscopic
      surgery. However, future research efforts should focus on the effect of virtual
      reality simulation on performance in the context of advanced surgical procedure, 
      on standardization of training, on the possibility of synergistic effect of
      virtual reality simulation training combined with mental training, on
      personalized training.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Considerable resources have been invested in low- and high-fidelity
      simulators in surgical training. To our knowledge, no investigation has compared 
      the 2 head to head for operative assessment purposes. The purpose of this study
      was to assess the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) low-fidelity video
      trainer and LapVR (high-fidelity virtual-reality simulator) for (1) construct and
      (2) predictive validity using a human cholecystectomy model. METHODS: Twenty-six 
      participants performed tasks from the FLS program and the LapVR simulator as well
      as a human laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Performance was evaluated using FLS and 
      LapVR metrics and the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills
      previously validated rating scale. RESULTS: Construct and predictive validity
      were strongly demonstrated for FLS tasks but only incompletely for LapVR.
      CONCLUSIONS: Efforts should be focused on using the well-validated lower-cost FLS
      video trainer for assessment of laparoscopic skills. The high-cost LapVR remains 
      experimental in resource-constrained training programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of structured and validated training curricula is one
      of the current priorities in robot-assisted urological surgery. OBJECTIVE: To
      establish the feasibility, acceptability, face validity, and educational impact
      of a structured training curriculum for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy
      (RARP), and to assess improvements in performance and ability to perform RARP
      after completion of the curriculum. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 12-wk
      training curriculum was developed based on an expert panel discussion and used to
      train ten fellows from major European teaching institutions. The curriculum
      included: (1) e-learning, (2) 1 wk of structured simulation-based training
      (virtual reality synthetic, animal, and cadaveric platforms), and (3) supervised 
      modular training for RARP. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The
      feasibility, acceptability, face validity, and educational impact were assessed
      using quantitative surveys. Improvement in the technical skills of participants
      over the training period was evaluated using the inbuilt validated assessment
      metrics on the da Vinci surgical simulator (dVSS). A final RARP performed by
      fellows on completion of their training was assessed using the Global Evaluative 
      Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) score and generic and procedure-specific
      scoring criteria. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The median baseline experience of
      participants as console surgeon was 4 mo (interquartile range [IQR] 0-6.5 mo).
      All participants completed the curriculum and were involved in a median of 18
      RARPs (IQR 14-36) during modular training. The overall score for dVSS tasks
      significantly increased over the training period (p<0.001-0.005). At the end of
      the curriculum, eight fellows (80%) were deemed able by their mentors to perform 
      a RARP independently, safely, and effectively. At assessment of the final RARP,
      the participants achieved an average score >/=4 (scale 1-5) for all domains using
      the GEARS scale and an average score >10 (scale 4-16) for all procedural steps
      using a generic dedicated scoring tool. In performance comparison using this
      scoring tool, the experts significantly outperformed the fellows (mean score for 
      all steps 13.6 vs 11). CONCLUSIONS: The European robot-assisted urologic training
      curriculum is acceptable, valid, and effective for training in RARP. PATIENT
      SUMMARY: This study shows that a 12-wk structured training program including
      simulation-based training and mentored training in the operating room allows
      surgeons with limited robotic experience to increase their robotic skills and
      their ability to perform the surgical steps of robot-assisted radical
      prostatectomy.

TI  - Augmented reality as an aid in maxillofacial surgery: validation of a wearable
      system allowing maxillary repositioning.

AB  - AIM: We present a newly designed, localiser-free, head-mounted system featuring
      augmented reality as an aid to maxillofacial bone surgery, and assess the
      potential utility of the device by conducting a feasibility study and validation.
      METHODS: Our head-mounted wearable system facilitating augmented surgery was
      developed as a stand-alone, video-based, see-through device in which the visual
      features were adapted to facilitate maxillofacial bone surgery. We implement a
      strategy designed to present augmented reality information to the operating
      surgeon. LeFort1 osteotomy was chosen as the test procedure. The system is
      designed to exhibit virtual planning overlaying the details of a real patient. We
      implemented a method allowing performance of waferless, augmented-reality
      assisted bone repositioning. In vitro testing was conducted on a physical replica
      of a human skull, and the augmented reality system was used to perform LeFort1
      maxillary repositioning. Surgical accuracy was measured with the aid of an
      optical navigation system that recorded the coordinates of three reference points
      (located in anterior, posterior right, and posterior left positions) on the
      repositioned maxilla. The outcomes were compared with those expected to be
      achievable in a three-dimensional environment. Data were derived using three
      levels of surgical planning, of increasing complexity, and for nine different
      operators with varying levels of surgical skill. RESULTS: The mean error was 1.70
      +/- 0.51 mm. The axial errors were 0.89 +/- 0.54 mm on the sagittal axis, 0.60
      +/- 0.20 mm on the frontal axis, and 1.06 +/- 0.40 mm on the craniocaudal axis.
      The simplest plan was associated with a slightly lower mean error (1.58 +/- 0.37 
      mm) compared with the more complex plans (medium: 1.82 +/- 0.71 mm; difficult:
      1.70 +/- 0.45 mm). The mean error for the anterior reference point was lower
      (1.33 +/- 0.58 mm) than those for both the posterior right (1.72 +/- 0.24 mm) and
      posterior left points (2.05 +/- 0.47 mm). No significant difference in terms of
      error was noticed among operators, despite variations in surgical experience.
      Feedback from surgeons was acceptable; all tests were completed within 15 min and
      the tool was considered to be both comfortable and usable in practice.
      CONCLUSION: We used a new localiser-free, head-mounted, wearable, stereoscopic,
      video see-through display to develop a useful strategy affording surgeons access 
      to augmented reality information. Our device appears to be accurate when used to 
      assist in waferless maxillary repositioning. Our results suggest that the method 
      can potentially be extended for use with many surgical procedures on the facial
      skeleton. Further, our positive results suggest that it would be appropriate to
      proceed to in vivo testing to assess surgical accuracy under real clinical
      conditions.

TI  - A new virtual-reality training module for laparoscopic surgical skills and
      equipment handling: can multitasking be trained? A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 184-91
LID - 10.1016/j.jsurg.2014.09.004 [doi]
LID - S1931-7204(14)00255-4 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: During laparoscopic surgery distractions often occur and multitasking 
      between surgery and other tasks, such as technical equipment handling, is a
      necessary competence. In psychological research, reduction of adverse effects of 
      distraction is demonstrated when specifically multitasking is trained. The aim of
      this study was to examine whether multitasking and more specifically
      task-switching can be trained in a virtual-reality (VR) laparoscopic skills
      simulator. DESIGN: After randomization, the control group trained separately with
      an insufflator simulation module and a laparoscopic skills exercise module on a
      VR simulator. In the intervention group, insufflator module and VR skills
      exercises were combined to develop a new integrated training in which
      multitasking was a required competence. At random moments, problems with the
      insufflator appeared and forced the trainee to multitask. During several
      repetitions of a different multitask VR skills exercise as posttest, performance 
      parameters (laparoscopy time, insufflator time, and errors) were measured and
      compared between both the groups as well with a pretest exercise to establish the
      learning effect. A face-validity questionnaire was filled afterward. SETTING:
      University Medical Centre Utrecht, The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Medical and PhD
      students (n = 42) from University Medical Centre Utrecht, without previous
      experience in laparoscopic simulation, were randomly assigned to either
      intervention (n = 21) or control group (n = 21). RESULTS: All participants
      performed better in the posttest exercises without distraction of the insufflator
      compared with the exercises in which multitasking was necessary to solve the
      insufflator problems. After training, the intervention group was significantly
      quicker in solving the insufflator problems (mean = 1.60Log(s) vs 1.70Log(s), p =
      0.02). No significant differences between both the groups were seen in
      laparoscopy time and errors. CONCLUSION: Multitasking has negative effects on the
      laparoscopic performance. This study suggests an additional learning effect of
      training multitasking in VR laparoscopy simulation, because the trainees are able
      to handle a secondary task (solving insufflator problems) quicker. These results 
      may aid the development of laparoscopy VR training programs in approximating
      real-life laparoscopic surgery.

TI  - Objective assessment of technique in laparoscopic colorectal surgery: what are
      the existing tools?
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1007/s10151-014-1242-9 [doi]
AB  - Assessment can improve the effectiveness of surgical training and enable valid
      judgments of competence. Laparoscopic colon resection surgery is now taught
      within surgical residency programs, and assessment tools are increasingly used to
      stimulate formative feedback and enhance learning. Formal assessment of technical
      performance in laparoscopic colon resection has been successfully applied at the 
      specialist level in the English "LAPCO" National Training Program. Objective
      assessment tools need to be developed for training and assessment in laparoscopic
      rectal cancer resection surgery. Simulation may have a future role in assessment 
      and accreditation in laparoscopic colorectal surgery; however, existing virtual
      reality models are not ready to be used for assessment of this advanced surgery.

TI  - A virtual reality model of the clivus and surgical simulation via transoral or
      transnasal route.
PG  - 3270-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurosurgery in areas with restricted space and complicated anatomy
      can be greatly aided by the virtual reality (VR) technique. The clivus represents
      one of such challenging surgical areas, but its VR has not been established. The 
      present study aimed to document a VR model of clival anatomy that may be useful
      in clival surgery. METHODS: High resolution CT angiography and MRI were used. The
      study included a total of 20 patients who did not have any obvious abnormalities 
      detected in the oral, nasal, and clival areas. The images were fused with a
      Dextroscope. RESULTS: In the VR model, the key structures such as the clival
      bone, basilar artery, brainstem, pituitary gland, and paranasal sinuses were
      clearly observed. The morphology of the clivus and its spatial relationships with
      the neighboring structures were also illustrated. Visualization of the clival
      model can be made flexible from various planes, angles, or orientations. In
      addition, surgical access to the clivus via the transoral route or transnasal
      route was simulated in detail. CONCLUSION: The simulation of the VR model offers 
      a straightforward, three-dimensional, interactive understanding of the size and
      shape of the clivus, and its relationships with the surrounding blood vessels and
      bones. It also demonstrates simulated operational procedures such as opening the 
      surgical window, measuring the exposure distance and angles, and determining the 
      critical boundaries in relation to key structures such as the brainstem and
      arteries. Digitalized VR modeling appears to be helpful for understanding the
      anatomy of the clivus and its surgical approaches.

TI  - Towards cybernetic surgery: robotic and augmented reality-assisted liver
      segmentectomy.
PG  - 381-5
LID - 10.1007/s00423-014-1256-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Augmented reality (AR) in surgery consists in the fusion of synthetic
      computer-generated images (3D virtual model) obtained from medical imaging
      preoperative workup and real-time patient images in order to visualize unapparent
      anatomical details. The 3D model could be used for a preoperative planning of the
      procedure. The potential of AR navigation as a tool to improve safety of the
      surgical dissection is outlined for robotic hepatectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Three patients underwent a fully robotic and AR-assisted hepatic segmentectomy.
      The 3D virtual anatomical model was obtained using a thoracoabdominal CT scan
      with a customary software (VR-RENDER(R), IRCAD). The model was then processed
      using a VR-RENDER(R) plug-in application, the Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP(R), 
      IRCAD), to delineate surgical resection planes including the elective ligature of
      vascular structures. Deformations associated with pneumoperitoneum were also
      simulated. The virtual model was superimposed to the operative field. A computer 
      scientist manually registered virtual and real images using a video mixer (MX 70;
      Panasonic, Secaucus, NJ) in real time. RESULTS: Two totally robotic AR
      segmentectomy V and one segmentectomy VI were performed. AR allowed for the
      precise and safe recognition of all major vascular structures during the
      procedure. Total time required to obtain AR was 8 min (range 6-10 min). Each
      registration (alignment of the vascular anatomy) required a few seconds. Hepatic 
      pedicle clamping was never performed. At the end of the procedure, the remnant
      liver was correctly vascularized. Resection margins were negative in all cases.
      The postoperative period was uneventful without perioperative transfusion.
      CONCLUSIONS: AR is a valuable navigation tool which may enhance the ability to
      achieve safe surgical resection during robotic hepatectomy.

TI  - Improving residency training in arthroscopic knee surgery with use of a
      virtual-reality simulator. A randomized blinded study.
PG  - 1798-806
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.N.00058 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of articles in the surgical literature
      demonstrating transfer validity (transfer of training). The purpose of this study
      was to assess whether skills learned on the ArthroSim virtual-reality
      arthroscopic knee simulator transferred to greater skill levels in the operating 
      room. METHODS: Postgraduate year-3 orthopaedic residents were randomized into
      simulator-trained and control groups at seven academic institutions. The
      experimental group trained on the simulator, performing a knee diagnostic
      arthroscopy procedure to a predetermined proficiency level based on the average
      proficiency of five community-based orthopaedic surgeons performing the same
      procedure on the simulator. The residents in the control group continued their
      institution-specific orthopaedic education and training. Both groups then
      performed a diagnostic knee arthroscopy procedure on a live patient. Video
      recordings of the arthroscopic surgery were analyzed by five pairs of expert
      arthroscopic surgeons blinded to the identity of the residents. A proprietary
      global rating scale and a procedural checklist, which included visualization and 
      probing scales, were used for rating. RESULTS: Forty-eight (89%) of the
      fifty-four postgraduate year-3 residents from seven academic institutions
      completed the study. The simulator-trained group averaged eleven hours of
      training on the simulator to reach proficiency. The simulator-trained group
      performed significantly better when rated according to our procedural checklist
      (p = 0.031), including probing skills (p = 0.016) but not visualization skills (p
      = 0.34), compared with the control group. The procedural checklist weighted
      probing skills double the weight of visualization skills. The global rating scale
      failed to reach significance (p = 0.061) because of one extreme outlier. The
      duration of the procedure was not significant. This lack of a significant
      difference seemed to be related to the fact that residents in the control group
      were less thorough, which shortened their time to completion of the arthroscopic 
      procedure. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated transfer validity (transfer of
      training) that residents trained to proficiency on a high-fidelity realistic
      virtual-reality arthroscopic knee simulator showed a greater skill level in the
      operating room compared with the control group. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We believe
      that the results of our study will stimulate residency program directors to
      incorporate surgical simulation into the core curriculum of their residency
      programs.

AB  - In recent years, development of computer graphics and haptic feedback technology 
      enabled the use of virtual reality. Virtual reality provides the opportunity to
      combine 3D visual imagery with interactivity, visual, and tactile realism.
      Robotic-assisted orthopedic surgery is defined as the use of computers and
      robotic technology to assist the orthopedist in providing musculoskeletal care,
      in which machine has the capability of precision and accuracy. Robotic-assisted
      orthopedic surgery is used in simulating diagnosis, preoperative and
      intraoperative planning, and actual surgery. One of the main areas for
      computer-assisted surgical applications is unicompartmental or bicompartmental
      knee arthroplasty, in which the clinical efficacy is improved by providing
      enhanced component positioning with dynamic ligament balancing.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to develop a training curriculum to evaluate the
      basic robotic skills necessary to reach an 80 % preset proficiency score and
      correlate the level of surgical experience with the overall performance obtained 
      using the da Vinci Surgical Skills simulator. METHODS: Twenty-two participants (4
      faculty, 4 senior, and 14 junior residents) were enrolled in a 4-week robotic
      training curriculum developed at our institution. A set of seven robotic skills
      were selected based on the manufacturer's exercise primary endpoint. During their
      pretesting session, participants completed one trial of each of the seven
      simulated exercises. In two individual sessions over a 2 week period, trainees
      practiced a different set of exercises that evaluated the same basic robotic
      skills assessed during pretesting with the objective of reaching an overall score
      of 80 % on two consecutive attempts. If proficiency was not achieved, then a
      maximum of six trials per exercise was allowed before advancing to the next
      skill. During their fourth week of training, participants completed a
      post-testing session with the same set of exercises used during pretesting.
      Participants' overall performance and various metrics were recorded in an online 
      database for further analysis. RESULTS: A significant skills gain from pre- to
      post-test was observed for each of the seven basic robotic skills regardless of
      participant's level of training (p < .001). Interestingly, participants only
      achieved an overall score of 80 % or more in only five of the seven exercises. No
      statistical difference in gain of skills was found between groups suggesting
      robotic skills development is independent of level of prior surgical expertise.
      CONCLUSION: A dedicated virtual reality robotic training curriculum significantly
      improves the seven basic robotic surgical skills necessary to operate the da
      Vinci Si surgical console. Six training trials appear to be insufficient to reach
      proficiency levels on more advanced skills.

AB  - The authors describe the first surgical case adopting the combination of
      real-time augmented reality and wearable computing devices such as Google Glass
      (Google Inc, Mountain View, California). A 66-year-old man presented to their
      institution for a total shoulder replacement after 5 years of progressive right
      shoulder pain and decreased range of motion. Throughout the surgical procedure,
      Google Glass was integrated with the Virtual Interactive Presence and Augmented
      Reality system (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama),
      enabling the local surgeon to interact with the remote surgeon within the local
      surgical field. Surgery was well tolerated by the patient and early surgical
      results were encouraging, with an improvement of shoulder pain and greater range 
      of motion. The combination of real-time augmented reality and wearable computing 
      devices such as Google Glass holds much promise in the field of surgery.

TI  - Design and evaluation of a new synthetic brain simulator for endoscopic third
      ventriculostomy.
PG  - 82-8
LID - 10.3171/2014.9.PEDS1447 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an effective but technically
      demanding procedure with significant risk. Current simulators, including human
      cadavers, animal models, and virtual reality systems, are expensive, relatively
      inaccessible, and can lack realistic sensory feedback. The purpose of this study 
      was to construct a realistic, low-cost, reusable brain simulator for ETV and
      evaluate its fidelity. METHODS: A brain silicone replica mimicking normal
      mechanical properties of a 4-month-old child with hydrocephalus was constructed, 
      encased in the replicated skull, and immersed in water. Realistic
      intraventricular landmarks included the choroid plexus, veins, mammillary bodies,
      infundibular recess, and basilar artery. The thinned-out third ventricle floor,
      which dissects appropriately, is quickly replaceable. Standard neuroendoscopic
      equipment including irrigation is used. Bleeding scenarios are also incorporated.
      A total of 16 neurosurgical trainees (Postgraduate Years 1-6) and 9 pediatric and
      adult neurosurgeons tested the simulator. All participants filled out
      questionnaires (5-point Likert-type items) to rate the simulator for face and
      content validity. RESULTS: The simulator is portable, robust, and sets up in
      minutes. More than 95% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the
      simulator's anatomical features, tissue properties, and bleeding scenarios were a
      realistic representation of that seen during an ETV. Participants stated that the
      simulator helped develop the required hand-eye coordination and camera skills,
      and the training exercise was valuable. CONCLUSIONS: A low-cost, reusable,
      silicone-based ETV simulator realistically represents the surgical procedure to
      trainees and neurosurgeons. It can help them develop the technical and cognitive 
      skills for ETV including dealing with complications.

TI  - Learning styles and the prospective ophthalmologist.
PG  - 344-7
LID - 10.3109/0142159X.2014.948827 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Understanding the learning styles of individual trainees may enable
      trainers to tailor an educational program and optimise learning. Surgical
      trainees have previously been shown to demonstrate a tendency towards particular 
      learning styles. We seek to clarify the relationship between learning style and
      learned surgical performance using a simulator, prior to surgical training.
      METHODS: The Kolb Learning Style Inventory was administered to a group of thirty 
      junior doctors. Participants were then asked to perform a series of tasks using
      the EyeSi virtual reality cataract surgery simulator (VR Magic, Mannheim,
      Germany). All completed a standard introductory programme to eliminate learning
      curve. They then undertook four attempts of level 4 forceps module binocularly.
      Total score, odometer movement (mm), corneal area injured (mm(2)), lens area
      injured (mm(2)) and total time taken (seconds) recorded. RESULTS: Mean age was
      31.6 years. No significant correlation was found between any learning style and
      any variable on the EyeSi cataract surgery simulator. CONCLUSION: There is a
      predominant learning style amongst surgical residents. There is however no
      demonstrable learning style that results in a better (or worse) performance on
      the EyeSi surgery simulator and hence in learning and performing cataract
      surgery.

TI  - Preoperative prediction of cosmetic results in breast conserving surgery.
PG  - 178-84
LID - 10.1002/jso.23782 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative objective predictions of cosmetic result after breast
      conserving surgery (BCS) has the potential to aid in surgical treatment decision 
      making. Our aim was to investigate the predictive value of tumor volume in
      relation to breast volume (TV/BV ratio) for cosmetic result. METHODS: Sixty-nine 
      invasive breast cancer women with preoperative MRI and treated by BCS and
      radiotherapy in 2007-2012 were prospectively included. Simple excision or basic
      oncoplastic techniques were used, but no volume displacement. TV/BV ratio was
      measured in the MRI while 3D-projected in virtual reality environment (I-Space). 
      Cosmetic result was assessed by patient questionnaire, panel evaluation, and
      breast retraction assessment (BRA). Quality-of-life was assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30
      and BR23. RESULTS: Intraobserver and interobserver correlation coefficients for
      tumor and breast volume were all >0.95. Increasing TV/BV ratio correlated with
      decreasing cosmetic result as determined by patient, panel, and BRA. TV/BV ratio 
      was a significant independent predictor for the panel evaluation (P=0.028), as
      was tumor location (P<0.05), and together they constituted a good prediction
      model (AUC 0.83). CONCLUSIONS: TV/BV ratio was a precise and independent
      predictor for cosmetic result determined by a panel and can be used as
      preoperative prediction tool to enable more informed surgical treatment decision 
      making.

TI  - Effects of laparoscopic instrument and finger on force perception: a first step
      towards laparoscopic force-skills training.
PG  - 1927-43
LID - 10.1007/s00464-014-3887-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In laparoscopic surgery, no external feedback on the magnitude of the
      force exerted is available. Hence, surgeons and residents tend to exert excessive
      force, which leads to tissue trauma. Ability of surgeons and residents to
      perceive their own force output without external feedback is a critical factor in
      laparoscopic force-skills training. Additionally, existing methods of
      laparoscopic training do not effectively train residents and novices on
      force-skills. Hence, there is growing need for the development of force-based
      training curriculum. OBJECTIVE: As a first step towards force-based laparoscopic 
      skills training, this study analysed force perception difference between
      laparoscopic instrument and finger in contralateral bimanual passive probing
      task. METHODS: The study compared the isometric force matching performance of
      novices, residents and surgeons with finger and laparoscopic instrument.
      Contralateral force matching paradigm was employed to analyse the force
      perception capability in terms of relative (accuracy), and constant errors in
      force matching. RESULTS: Force perception of experts was found to be better than 
      novices and residents. Interestingly, laparoscopic instrument was more accurate
      in discriminating the forces than finger. The dominant hand attempted to match
      the forces accurately, whereas non-dominant hand (NH) overestimated the forces.
      Further, the NH of experts was found to be most accurate. Furthermore, excessive 
      forces were applied at lower force levels and at very high force levels.
      CONCLUSIONS: Due to misperception of force, novices and residents applied
      excessive forces. However, experts had good control over force with both dominant
      and NHs. These findings suggest that force-based training curricula should not
      only have proprioception tasks, but should also include bimanual force-skills
      training exercises in order to improve force perception ability and hand skills
      of novices and residents. The results can be used as a performance metric in both
      box and virtual reality based force-skills training.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ototoxicity caused by medication can lead to debilitating symptoms
      such as dizziness, vertigo and postural instability. There is no current 'gold
      standard' treatment available. CASE REPORT: A 79-year-old male, with bilateral
      loss of vestibular function caused by gentamicin toxicity after surgery for
      prosthetic valve endocarditis, complained of dizziness, difficulty in walking and
      an increased risk of falling. Physical examination showed a positive head thrust 
      test suggesting bilateral loss of vestibular function. RESULTS: The patient
      underwent a specific motion-based virtual reality enhanced protocol for
      peripheral vestibular disease. He showed a great improvement, with a 50 per cent 
      reduction in his Dizziness Handicap Inventory score. CONCLUSION: Computer-aided
      rehabilitation programmes might represent an important advance in gait and
      posture training.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the use and validity of
      virtual reality modules as part of the educational approach to mastering
      arthroscopy in a safe environment by assessing the ability to distinguish between
      experience levels. Additionally, the study aimed to evaluate whether experts have
      greater ambidexterity than do novices. METHODS: Three virtual reality modules
      (Swemac/Augmented Reality Systems, Linkoping, Sweden) were created to test
      fundamental arthroscopic skills. Thirty participants-10 experts consisting of
      faculty, 10 intermediate participants consisting of orthopaedic residents, and 10
      novices consisting of medical students-performed each exercise. Steady and
      Telescope was designed to train centering and image stability. Steady and Probe
      was designed to train basic triangulation. Track and Moving Target was designed
      to train coordinated motions of arthroscope and probe. Metrics reflecting speed, 
      accuracy, and efficiency of motion were used to measure construct validity.
      RESULTS: Steady and Probe and Track a Moving Target both exhibited construct
      validity, with better performance by experts and intermediate participants than
      by novices (P < .05), whereas Steady and Telescope did not show validity. There
      was an overall trend toward better ambidexterity as a function of greater
      surgical experience, with experts consistently more proficient than novices
      throughout all 3 modules. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents a new way to assess 
      basic arthroscopy skills using virtual reality modules developed through task
      deconstruction. Participants with the most arthroscopic experience performed
      better and were more consistent than novices on all 3 virtual reality modules.
      Greater arthroscopic experience correlates with more symmetry of ambidextrous
      performance. However, further adjustment of the modules may better simulate
      fundamental arthroscopic skills and discriminate between experience levels.
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Arthroscopy training is a critical element of orthopaedic
      surgery resident training. Developing techniques to safely and effectively train 
      these skills is critical for patient safety and resident education.

      randomised educational superiority trial.
PG  - 215
LID - 10.1186/1472-6920-14-215 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of structured curricula for minimally invasive surgery
      training is becoming increasingly popular. However, many laparoscopic training
      programs still use basic skills and isolated task training, despite increasing
      evidence to support the use of training models with higher functional
      resemblance, such as whole procedural modules. In contrast to basic skills
      training, procedural training involves several cognitive skills such as elements 
      of planning, movement integration, and how to avoid adverse events. The objective
      of this trial is to investigate the specificity of procedural practice in
      laparoscopic simulator training. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomised single-centre
      educational superiority trial. Participants are 96 surgical novices (medical
      students) without prior laparoscopic experience. Participants start by practicing
      a series of basic skills tasks to a predefined proficiency level on a virtual
      reality laparoscopy simulator. Upon reaching proficiency, the participants are
      randomised to either the intervention group, which practices two procedures (an
      appendectomy followed by a salpingectomy) or to the control group, practicing
      only one procedure (a salpingectomy) on the simulator. 1:1 central randomisation 
      is used and participants are stratified by sex and time to complete the basic
      skills. Data collection is done at a surgical skills centre.The primary outcome
      is the number of repetitions required to reach a predefined proficiency level on 
      the salpingectomy module. The secondary outcome is the total training time to
      proficiency. The improvement in motor skills and effect on cognitive load are
      also explored. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial might provide new knowledge 
      on how the technical part of surgical training curricula should be comprised in
      the future. To examine the specificity of practice in procedural simulator
      training is of great importance in order to develop more comprehensive surgical
      curricula. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02069951.

AB  - PURPOSE: Laparoscopic surgery represents specific challenges, such as the
      reduction of a three-dimensional anatomic environment to two dimensions. The aim 
      of this study was to investigate the impact of the loss of the third dimension on
      laparoscopic virtual reality (VR) performance. METHODS: We compared a group of
      examinees with impaired stereopsis (group 1, n = 28) to a group with accurate
      stereopsis (group 2, n = 29). The primary outcome was the difference between the 
      mean total score (MTS) of all tasks taken together and the performance in task 3 
      (eye-hand coordination), which was a priori considered to be the most dependent
      on intact stereopsis. RESULTS: The MTS and performance in task 3 tended to be
      slightly, but not significantly, better in group 2 than in group 1 [MTS: -0.12
      (95 % CI -0.32, 0.08; p = 0.234); task 3: -0.09 (95 % CI -0.29, 0.11; p =
      0.385)]. The difference of MTS between simulated impaired stereopsis between
      group 2 (by attaching an eye patch on the adominant eye in the 2nd run) and the
      first run of group 1 was not significant (MTS: p = 0.981; task 3: p = 0.527).
      CONCLUSION: We were unable to demonstrate an impact of impaired examinees'
      stereopsis on laparoscopic VR performance. Individuals with accurate stereopsis
      seem to be able to compensate for the loss of the third dimension in laparoscopic
      VR simulations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Over the past decade, simulation-based training has come to the
      foreground as an efficient method for training and assessment of surgical skills 
      in minimal invasive surgery. Box-trainers and virtual reality (VR) simulators
      have been introduced in the teaching curricula and have substituted to some
      extent the traditional model of training based on animals or cadavers. Augmented 
      reality (AR) is a new technology that allows blending of VR elements and real
      objects within a real-world scene. In this paper, we present a novel AR simulator
      for assessment of basic laparoscopic skills. METHODS: The components of the
      proposed system include: a box-trainer, a camera and a set of laparoscopic tools 
      equipped with custom-made sensors that allow interaction with VR training
      elements. Three AR tasks were developed, focusing on basic skills such as
      perception of depth of field, hand-eye coordination and bimanual operation. The
      construct validity of the system was evaluated via a comparison between two
      experience groups: novices with no experience in laparoscopic surgery and
      experienced surgeons. The observed metrics included task execution time, tool
      pathlength and two task-specific errors. The study also included a feedback
      questionnaire requiring participants to evaluate the face-validity of the system.
      RESULTS: Between-group comparison demonstrated highly significant differences
      (<0.01) in all performance metrics and tasks denoting the simulator's construct
      validity. Qualitative analysis on the instruments' trajectories highlighted
      differences between novices and experts regarding smoothness and economy of
      motion. Subjects' ratings on the feedback questionnaire highlighted the
      face-validity of the training system. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the
      potential of the proposed simulator to discriminate groups with different
      expertise providing a proof of concept for the potential use of AR as a core
      technology for laparoscopic simulation training.

      handling.
PG  - 283-7

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic tissue handling is quite difficult to measure using
      virtual-reality laparoscopic simulators and box-trainer exercises, and therefore,
      completion time is the predominant performance measure for simulation-based
      laparoscopic training exercises. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
      construct validity of a training and assessment model for precise laparoscopic
      handling of delicate tissue. METHODS: Participants (n = 35) completed 2
      progressively challenging laparoscopic tissue translocation exercises using
      delicate foam pieces and templates. Deidentified performances were scored using
      objective measures for tissue damage, accuracy, percentage complete, and
      completion time. Evaluation included multiple analysis of variance with repeated 
      measures among the 3 groups as follows: medical students, residents and faculty
      who perform laparoscopic surgery less than once per week, and faculty members who
      perform laparoscopic surgery at least once per week. RESULTS: The model
      demonstrated significant construct validity by discriminating performances
      between the types of shapes and templates and across the levels of surgical
      experience on all dimensions. A significant interaction effect between the level 
      of expertise and the difficulty of the exercise revealed excellent discrimination
      between experienced laparoscopic surgeons and others. DISCUSSION: This low-cost
      model provides an alternative or adjunct platform for laparoscopic training and
      assessment that requires precise and measurable handling of a delicate tissue.

AB  - In virtual surgery of minimally invasive vascular intervention, the force
      feedback is transmitted through the flexible guide wire. The disturbance caused
      by the flexible deformation would affect the fidelity of the VR (virtual reality)
      training. SMC (sliding mode control) strategy with delayed-output observer is
      adopted to suppress the effect of flexible deformation. In this study, the
      control performance of the strategy is assessed when the length of guide wire
      between actuator and the operating point changes. The performance assessment
      results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and find the optimal
      length of guide wire for the force feedback control.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Surgical residents have learned flexible endoscopy by practicing on
      patients in hospital settings under the strict guidance of experienced surgeons. 
      Simulation is often used to "pretrain" novices on endoscopic skills before real
      clinical practice; nonetheless, the optimal method of training remains unknown.
      The purpose of this study was to compare endoscopic virtual reality and physical 
      model simulators and their respective roles in transferring skills to the
      clinical environment. METHODS: At the beginning of a skills development rotation,
      27 surgical postgraduate year 1 residents performed a baseline screening
      colonoscopy on a real patient under faculty supervision. Their performances were 
      scored using the Global Assessment of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Skills (GAGES).
      Subsequently, interns completed a 3-week flexible endoscopy curriculum developed 
      at our institution. One-third of the residents were assigned to train with the GI
      Mentor simulator, one-third trained with the Kyoto simulator, and one-third of
      the residents trained using both simulators. At the end of their rotations, each 
      postgraduate year 1 resident performed one posttest colonoscopy on a different
      patient and was again scored using GAGES by an experienced faculty. RESULTS: A
      statistically significant improvement in the GAGES total score (p < 0.001) and on
      each of its subcomponents (p = 0.001) was observed from pretest to posttest for
      all groups combined. Subgroup analysis indicated that trainees in the GI Mentor
      or both simulators conditions showed significant improvement from pretest to
      posttest in terms of GAGES total score (p = 0.017 vs 0.024, respectively). This
      was not observed for those exclusively using the Kyoto platform (p = 0.072).
      Nonetheless, no single training condition was shown to be a better training
      modality when compared to others in terms of total GAGES score or in any of its
      subcomponents. CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy simulator training with the GI Mentor
      platform exclusively or in combination with a physical model simulator improves
      skill performance in real colonoscopy cases when measured with the GAGES tool.

AB  - A virtual reality (VR) based vascular intervention simulation system is
      introduced in this paper, which helps trainees develop surgical skills and
      experience complications in safety remote from patients. The system simulates
      interventional radiology procedures, in which flexible tipped guidewires are
      employed to advance diagnostic or therapeutic catheters into vascular anatomy of 
      a patient. A real-time physically-based modeling approach ground on Kirchhoff
      elastic rod is proposed to simulate complicated behaviors of guidewires and
      catheters. The slender body of guidewire and catheter is modeled using more
      efficient special case of naturally straight, isotropic Kirchhoff rods, and the
      shorter flexible tip composed of straight or angled design is modeled using more 
      complex generalized Kirchhoff rods. The motion equations for guidewire and
      catheter were derived with continuous elastic energy, followed by a
      discretization using a linear implicit scheme that guarantees stability and
      robustness. In addition, we used a fast-projection method to enforce the
      inextensibility of guidewire and catheter. An adaptive sampling algorithm was
      also implemented to improve the simulation efficiency without decrease of
      accuracy. Experimental results revealed that our system is both robust and
      efficient in a real-time performance.

TI  - Craniofacial reconstruction evaluation by geodesic network.
PG  - 943647
LID - 10.1155/2014/943647 [doi]
AB  - Craniofacial reconstruction is to estimate an individual's face model from its
      skull. It has a widespread application in forensic medicine, archeology, medical 
      cosmetic surgery, and so forth. However, little attention is paid to the
      evaluation of craniofacial reconstruction. This paper proposes an objective
      method to evaluate globally and locally the reconstructed craniofacial faces
      based on the geodesic network. Firstly, the geodesic networks of the
      reconstructed craniofacial face and the original face are built, respectively, by
      geodesics and isogeodesics, whose intersections are network vertices. Then, the
      absolute value of the correlation coefficient of the features of all
      corresponding geodesic network vertices between two models is taken as the
      holistic similarity, where the weighted average of the shape index values in a
      neighborhood is defined as the feature of each network vertex. Moreover, the
      geodesic network vertices of each model are divided into six subareas, that is,
      forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, cheeks, and chin, and the local similarity is
      measured for each subarea. Experiments using 100 pairs of reconstructed
      craniofacial faces and their corresponding original faces show that the
      evaluation by our method is roughly consistent with the subjective evaluation
      derived from thirty-five persons in five groups.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a novel ultrasound device may be used
      with a simplified augmented reality technique, and to compare this device with
      conventional techniques during vascular access using a vascular phantom. DESIGN: 
      Prospective, randomized study. SETTING: Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine
      departments of a university-affiliated hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 20 physicians with
      no experience with ultrasound-guided techniques. MEASUREMENTS: All participants
      performed the vascular access technique on the vascular phantom model using both 
      a conventional device and the new ultrasound device. Time and the number of
      redirections of the needle until aspiration of dye into a vessel of the vascular 
      phantom were measured. MAIN RESULTS: The median/interquartile range of time was
      39.5/41.7 seconds versus 18.6/10.0 seconds (P < 0.001) and number of redirections
      was 3/3.5 versus 1/0 (P < 0.001) for the conventional and novel ultrasound
      devices, respectively. CONCLUSION: During vascular access in a vascular phantom
      model, the novel device decreased the time and the number of redirections
      significantly. The device successfully improved the efficiency of the
      ultrasound-guided vascular access technique.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this trial was to assess which type of warm-up has
      the highest effect on virtual reality (VR) laparoscopy performance. The following
      warm-up strategies were applied: a hands-on exercise (group 1), a cognitive
      exercise (group 2), and no warm-up (control, group 3). DESIGN: This is a 3-arm
      randomized controlled trial. SETTING: The trial was conducted at the department
      of surgery of the University Hospital Basel in Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: A total
      of 94 participants, all laypersons without any surgical or VR experience,
      completed the study. RESULTS: A total of 96 participants were randomized, 31 to
      group 1, 31 to group 2, and 32 to group 3. There were 2 postrandomization
      exclusions. In the multivariate analysis, we found no evidence that the
      intervention had an effect on VR performance as represented by 6 calculated
      subscores of accuracy, time, and path length for (1) camera manipulation and (2) 
      hand-eye coordination combined with 2-handed maneuvers (p = 0.795). Neither the
      comparison of the average of the intervention groups (groups 1 and 2) vs control 
      (group 3) nor the pairwise comparisons revealed any significant differences in VR
      performance, neither multivariate nor univariate. VR performance improved with
      increasing performance score in the cognitive exercise warm-up (iPad 3D puzzle)
      for accuracy, time, and path length in the camera navigation task. CONCLUSIONS:
      We were unable to show an effect of the 2 tested warm-up strategies on VR
      performance in laypersons. We are currently designing a follow-up study including
      surgeons rather than laypersons with a longer warm-up exercise, which is more
      closely related to the final task.

TI  - Development of the McGill simulator for endoscopic sinus surgery: a new
      high-fidelity virtual reality simulator for endoscopic sinus surgery.
PG  - 330-4
LID - 10.2500/ajra.2014.28.4046 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The technical challenges of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and the
      high risk of complications support the development of alternative modalities to
      train residents in these procedures. Virtual reality simulation is becoming a
      useful tool for training the skills necessary for minimally invasive surgery;
      however, there are currently no ESS virtual reality simulators available with
      valid evidence supporting their use in resident education. Our aim was to develop
      a new rhinology simulator, as well as to define potential performance metrics for
      trainee assessment. METHODS: The McGill simulator for endoscopic sinus surgery
      (MSESS), a new sinus surgery virtual reality simulator with haptic feedback, was 
      developed (a collaboration between the McGill University Department of
      Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, the Montreal Neurologic Institute
      Simulation Lab, and the National Research Council of Canada). A panel of experts 
      in education, performance assessment, rhinology, and skull base surgery convened 
      to identify core technical abilities that would need to be taught by the
      simulator, as well as performance metrics to be developed and captured. RESULTS: 
      The MSESS allows the user to perform basic sinus surgery skills, such as an
      ethmoidectomy and sphenoidotomy, through the use of endoscopic tools in a virtual
      nasal model. The performance metrics were developed by an expert panel and
      include measurements of safety, quality, and efficiency of the procedure.
      CONCLUSION: The MSESS incorporates novel technological advancements to create a
      realistic platform for trainees. To our knowledge, this is the first simulator to
      combine novel tools such as the endonasal wash and elaborate anatomic deformity
      with advanced performance metrics for ESS.

LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000000857 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates whether video-based coaching can enhance
      laparoscopic surgical skills performance. BACKGROUND: Many professions utilize
      coaching to improve performance. The sports industry employs video analysis to
      maximize improvement from every performance. METHODS: Laparoscopic novices were
      baseline tested and then trained on a validated virtual reality (VR) laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy (LC) curriculum. After competence, subjects were randomized on a 
      1:1 ratio and each performed 5 VRLCs. After each LC, intervention group subjects 
      received video-based coaching by a surgeon, utilizing an adaptation of the GROW
      (Goals, Reality, Options, Wrap-up) coaching model. Control subjects viewed online
      surgical lectures. All subjects then performed 2 porcine LCs. Performance was
      assessed by blinded video review using validated global rating scales. RESULTS:
      Twenty subjects were recruited. No significant differences were observed between 
      groups in baseline performance and in VRLC1. For each subsequent repetition,
      intervention subjects significantly outperformed controls on all global rating
      scales. Interventions outperformed controls in porcine LC1 [Global Operative
      Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills: (20.5 vs 15.5; P = 0.011), Objective
      Structured Assessment of Technical Skills: (21.5vs 14.5; P = 0.001), and
      Operative Performance Rating System: (26 vs 19.5; P = 0.001)] and porcine LC2
      [Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills: (28 vs 17.5; P = 0.005),
      Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills: (30 vs 16.5; P < 0.001), and
      Operative Performance Rating System: (36 vs 21; P = 0.004)]. Intervention
      subjects took significantly longer than controls in porcine LC1 (2920 vs 2004
      seconds; P = 0.009) and LC2 (2297 vs 1683; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Despite
      equivalent exposure to practical laparoscopic skills training, video-based
      coaching enhanced the quality of laparoscopic surgical performance on both VR and
      porcine LCs, although at the expense of increased time. Video-based coaching is a
      feasible method of maximizing performance enhancement from every clinical
      exposure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether gynecologists have impaired laparoscopic skills
      and/or reduced cognitive function after long on-call hours. DESIGN: Prospective
      cohort study. SETTING: Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Norway.
      POPULATION: 28 gynecologists working long shifts in a single department. METHODS:
      Pre-training of laparoscopic skills on a virtual reality simulator. Simulator-
      and cognitive testing on two different occasions; one in the morning after a
      normal nights' sleep at home and one in the morning directly after 17.5 h on
      call. The virtual reality simulator test consisted of three repetitive
      salpingectomies in an ectopic pregnancy module. The cognitive test consisted of a
      standardized cognitive test battery (Cambridge neuropsychological test automated 
      battery). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Simulated laparoscopic performance was assessed 
      by time to perform the procedure, total length of instrument movement (tip
      trajectory) and blood loss. Cognitive function was assessed by reaction time,
      errors and total score. RESULTS: No significant impairment in laparoscopic skills
      was found after 17.5 h on call. Cognitive testing revealed a statistically
      significant increase in reaction time post-call. Construct validity for the
      metrics "time to perform procedure" and "tip trajectory" in the ectopic pregnancy
      module was established in a validation study prior to our main study.
      CONCLUSIONS: We were not able to detect impaired laparoscopic skills among
      gynecologists tested by a virtual reality procedural module after 17.5 h on call.
      We found a small increase in reaction time but no other signs of reduced
      cognitive function. The study adds information on surgical performance of
      sleep-deprived gynecologists.

TI  - The SimPORTAL fluoro-less C-arm trainer: an innovative device for percutaneous
      kidney access.
PG  - 240-5
LID - 10.1089/end.2014.0401 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Achieving proper renal access is arguably the most
      challenging component of percutaneous nephrolithotomy. A core skill required
      during this procedure is the use of C-arm fluoroscopic imaging and parallax
      techniques for proper needle insertion into a predetermined calyceal papilla. The
      trainers available for these skills include virtual reality (VR) simulators and
      physical models requiring actual fluoroscopy and radiation exposure precautions. 
      In this study we present the successful proof-of-concept of a low-cost physical
      fluoro-less C-arm trainer (CAT) for training percutaneous renal access. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: The SimPORTAL CAT includes a mini C-arm for simulating fluoroscopic 
      imaging and a silicon flank simulation model for needle insertion. The C-arm has 
      two mounted video cameras and is jointed to tilt and rainbow. The flank model
      contains an anatomically accurate cast of the upper urinary tract, including the 
      ureter, calyces, and the renal pelvis, with an overlay of ribs to visually and
      tactically simulate the 10th-12th ribs. The simulated fluoroscopic imaging is
      viewed on a computer screen allowing for real-time visualization. Preliminary
      surveys were completed by participants (n=14) at a training course that took
      place in Hemel Hampsted to obtain information on the acceptability of version 2.1
      of the model. RESULTS: We have successfully created a fluoro-less CAT that
      achieves the goals of training percutaneous access of the kidney. All
      participants (100%) considered the concept of avoiding radiation exposure during 
      training as a highly valuable feature. About 92.8% of the enrolled participants
      considered the CAT of at least equal value to existing VR training models.
      CONCLUSIONS: The fluoroscopy-less CAT is an economically feasible and accurate
      model for training parallax. It effectively replicates the functions of a C-arm
      X-ray system for percutaneous access to the kidney without any radiation exposure
      to the learner. Further studies will examine construct validity for training and 
      assessing percutaneous access skills.

TI  - Effect of instructor feedback on skills retention after laparoscopic simulator
      training: follow-up of a randomized trial.

LID - 10.1016/j.jsurg.2014.06.013 [doi]
LID - S1931-7204(14)00191-3 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Instructor feedback reduces the number of repetitions and time to
      reach proficiency during laparoscopic simulator training. The objective of this
      study was to examine the effect of instructor feedback on long-term skill
      retention. METHODS: A 6-month follow-up of a randomized trial. Participants were 
      surgical novices (medical students). All participants (n = 99) initially
      practiced a laparoscopic salpingectomy on the LapSim virtual reality simulator to
      proficiency. The intervention group could request instructor feedback, whereas
      the control group could not. After 6 months, the participants (n = 65) practiced 
      on the simulator until they reached proficiency again. The primary outcomes were 
      the total time and the number of repetitions. RESULTS: Initially, the
      intervention group used significantly fewer repetitions (29 vs 65, p < 0.0005)
      and less total training time (162 vs 342 min, p < 0.0005) than the control group 
      to reach the proficiency level. At follow-up, both the groups used an equal
      number of repetitions (21 vs 20, p = 0.72) and time (83 vs 73 min, p = 0.37) to
      reach the same proficiency level. CONCLUSIONS: Instructor feedback during
      proficiency-based laparoscopic simulator training does not affect the long-term
      retention of skills.

LID - S1931-7204(14)00203-7 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Simulation is a common adjunct to operative training and various
      modalities exist for ureteroscopy. This systematic review aims the following: (1)
      to identify available ureteroscopy simulators, (2) to explore evidence for their 
      effectiveness using characteristic criterion, and (3) to provide recommendations 
      for simulation-based ureteroscopy training. DESIGN: The preferred reporting items
      for systematic reviews and meta-analysis statement guidelines were used. A
      literature search was performed using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library
      databases. RESULTS: In total, 20 articles concerning ureteroscopy simulators were
      included. Overall, 3 high-fidelity bench models are available. The Uro-Scopic
      Trainer has demonstrated face, construct, and concurrent validity, whereas the
      Scope Trainer has undergone content, construct, and predictive validation. The
      adult ureteroscopy trainer has demonstrated face, content, and construct
      validity. The URO Mentor is the only available ureteroscopy virtual-reality
      system; 10 studies were identified demonstrating its face, content, construct,
      concurrent, and predictive validity. The Uro-Scopic Trainer, the Scope Trainer,
      and the URO Mentor have demonstrated high educational impact. A noncommercially
      available, low-fidelity model has demonstrated effectiveness comparable to its
      high-fidelity counterpart at 185 times lesser than the price of the Uro-Scopic
      Trainer. The use of porcine models has also been described in 3 studies but
      require further study. CONCLUSIONS: Valid models are available for
      simulation-based ureteroscopy training. However, there is a lack of many
      high-level studies conducted, and further investigation is required in this area.
      Furthermore, current research focuses on the technical skills acquisition with
      little research conducted on nontechnical skills acquisition within ureteroscopy.
      The next step for ureteroscopy training is a formalized and validated curriculum,
      incorporating simulation, training models, development of nontechnical skills,
      and real-life practice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We introduce a rating tool that objectively evaluates the skills of
      surgical trainees performing cochlear implant surgery. METHODS: Seven residents
      and seven experts performed cochlear implant surgery sessions from mastoidectomy 
      to cochleostomy on a standardized virtual reality temporal bone. A total of
      twenty-eight assessment videos were recorded and two consultant otolaryngologists
      evaluated the performance of each participant using these videos. RESULTS:
      Interrater reliability was calculated using the intraclass correlation
      coefficient for both the global and checklist components of the assessment
      instrument. The overall agreement was high. The construct validity of this
      instrument was strongly supported by the significantly higher scores in the
      expert group for both components. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the
      proposed assessment tool for cochlear implant surgery is reliable, accurate, and 
      easy to use. This instrument can thus be used to provide objective feedback on
      overall and task-specific competency in cochlear implantation.

TI  - Virtual reality surgical simulators- a prerequisite for robotic surgery.
PG  - 125-7
LID - 10.1007/s13193-014-0314-7 [doi]
AB  - The field of computer assisted minimally invasive surgery is rapidly expanding
      worldwide, including in India. With more hospitals in India contemplating the
      acquisition of a robotic platform, training of robotic surgeons is becoming
      essential. Virtual reality simulators can be used for surgeons to become
      acquainted with the robotic console prior to live surgery. Our aim was to
      evaluate the amount of simulator training required before a surgeon first
      operates on the da Vinci(R) Surgical System. Simulations were conducted on the
      Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci(R) Robot Skill Simulator using the software
      obtained from Mimic Technologies. Participants included attending staff surgeons 
      experienced in robotic surgery and novices. A set of seven activities were chosen
      for each participant. Based on the mean exercise score from the first attempt,
      staff surgeons outperformed the novices in all exercises. However, the difference
      in score between the staff and the novices decreased after the participants
      repeated the exercises and by the sixth attempt most of the novices obtained
      similar scores to the staff, suggesting that this might be at present the minimum
      set of repetitions indicated (or required) prior to performing life robotic
      surgery.

TI  - Validation of the PASSPORT V2 training environment for arthroscopic skills.
AB  - PURPOSE: Virtual reality simulators used in the education of orthopaedic
      residents often lack realistic haptic feedback. To solve this, the (Practice
      Arthroscopic Surgical Skills for Perfect Operative Real-life Treatment) PASSPORT 
      simulator was developed, which was subjected to fundamental changes: improved
      realism and user interface. The purpose was to demonstrate its face and construct
      validity. METHODS: Thirty-one participants were divided into three groups having 
      different levels of arthroscopic experience. Participants answered questions
      regarding general information and the outer appearance of the simulator for face 
      validity. Construct validity was assessed with one standardized navigation task, 
      which was timed. Face validity, educational value and user-friendliness were
      determined with two representative exercises and by asking participants to fill
      out the questionnaire. A value of 7 or greater was considered sufficient.
      RESULTS: Construct validity was demonstrated between experts and novices. Median 
      task time for the fifth trial was 55 s (range 17-139 s) for the novices, 33 s
      (range 17-59 s) for the intermediates, and 26 s (range 14-52 s) for the experts. 
      Median task times of three trials were not significantly different between the
      novices and intermediates, and none of the trials between intermediates and
      experts. Face validity, educational value and user-friendliness were perceived as
      sufficient (median >7). The presence of realistic tactile feedback was considered
      the biggest asset of the simulator. CONCLUSION: Proper preparation for
      arthroscopic operations will increase the quality of real-life surgery and
      patients' safety. The PASSPORT simulator can assist in achieving this, as it
      showed construct and face validity, and its physical nature offered adequate
      haptic feedback during training. This indicates that PASSPORT has potential to
      evolve as a valuable training modality.

TI  - Virtual reality AYRA software for preoperative planning in facial
      allotransplantation.
PG  - 1805-9
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0000000000000989 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to validate a virtual reality software for
      the recording of anthropometric measurements as a first step towards matching
      donors with recipients in the preoperative planning process which precedes the
      harvest of a facial allograft. METHODS: Anthropometric measurements of both soft 
      and bone tissue were recorded in 5 cryopreserved human heads to compare
      conventional analogue measurements with digital measurements obtained from
      3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions produced using AYRA software. To test the
      degree of correlation between both measuring methods, intraclass correlation
      coefficient (ICC) was applied to each pair of measurements. RESULTS: ICCs
      calculated were greater than 0.6 (substantial or almost perfect correlation) for 
      all of the pairs of variables, with the exception of 2 of the measurements
      studied in bone tissue. CONCLUSIONS: In facial transplantation, preoperative
      planning is crucial to select an allograft whose anatomical compatibility with
      the recipient defect is as close as possible. The dimensions of the potential
      face donor must be congruent to ensure the procedure's feasibility and the
      adequate insertion of the allograft into the defect. The recording of
      anthropometric measurements with the virtual reality software displayed an
      equivalent correlation to those produced using a conventional analogue method.
      The 3D reconstructions obtained by using a virtual reality software can play a
      useful role to facilitate the characterization of the donor face.

TI  - Accuracy of chairside-milled CAD/CAM drill guides for dental implants.
PG  - 115-24
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a chairside method for producing implant guides based solely
      on digital data and present a first assessment of in vitro accuracy on plaster
      models. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four implants were planned and pilot
      drillings were performed according to a new protocol, which is based on the
      registration of CBCT and CAD/CAM data. Chairside-milled one-piece drill guides
      were used to transfer the virtual plan into reality. Accuracy measurements were
      acquired. RESULTS: Chairside-milled drill guides were successfully fabricated and
      accuracy for pilot drillings was between 0.17 and 1.3 mm. CONCLUSION: Within the 
      limits of this experimental study, chairside-milled drill guides are feasible and
      do not require any preparation before CBCT scanning.

PG  - 333-8

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review are to summarize the current training
      modalities and assessment tools used in urological robotic surgery and to propose
      principles to guide the formation of a comprehensive robotics curriculum.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PUBMED database was systematically searched for
      relevant articles and their citations utilized to broaden our search. These
      articles were reviewed and summarized with a focus on novel developments.
      RESULTS: A multitude of training modalities including didactic, dry lab, wet lab,
      and virtual reality have been developed. The use of these modalities can be
      divided into basic skills-based exercises and more advanced procedure-based
      exercises. Clinical training has largely followed traditional methods of surgical
      teaching with the exception of the unique development of tele-mentoring for the
      da Vinci interface. Tools to assess both real-life and simulator performance have
      been developed, including adaptions from Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery and
      Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill, and novel tools such as
      Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills. CONCLUSIONS: The use of these
      different entities to create a standardized curriculum for robotic surgery
      remains elusive. Selection of training modalities and assessment tools should be 
      based upon performance data-based validity and practical feasibility. Comparative
      assessment of different modalities (cross-modality validity) can help strengthen 
      the development of common skill sets. Constant data collection must occur to
      guide continuing curriculum improvement.

LID - S0039-6060(14)00215-3 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both intra- and perioperative care are essential for patients'
      safety. Training for intraoperative technical skills on simulators and for
      perioperative care in virtual patients have independently demonstrated
      educational value, but no training combining these 2 approaches has been designed
      yet. The aim of this study was to design a pathway approach for training in
      general surgery. A common disease requiring essential skills was chosen, namely, 
      acute appendicitis. METHODS: Preoperative care training was created using virtual
      patients presenting with acute right iliac fossa (RIF) pain. A competency-based
      curriculum for laparoscopic appendectomy (LAPP) was designed on a virtual reality
      simulator: Novices (<10 LAPP) and experienced surgeons (>100 LAPP) were enrolled 
      to perform 2 virtual LAPP for assessment of validity evidence; novices performed 
      8 further LAPP for analysis of a learning curve. Finally, postoperative virtual
      patients were reviewed after LAPP. RESULTS: Four preoperative patient scenarios
      were designed with different presentations of RIF; not all required operative
      management. Comments were provided through case progression to allow autonomous
      practice. Ten novices and 10 experienced surgeons were enrolled for
      intraoperative training. Time taken (median values) of novices versus experienced
      surgeons (285 vs 259 seconds; P = .026) and performance score (67% vs 99%; P <
      .0001) demonstrated evidence for validity, whereas path length did not (916 vs
      673 cm; P = .113). Proficiency benchmark criteria were defined for measures with 
      validity evidence. Two postoperative virtual patients were created with an
      uneventful or complicated outcome. CONCLUSION: A virtual care pathway approach
      has been designed for acute appendicitis, enabling trainees to follow simulated
      patients from admission to discharge.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare the validity of
      high-fidelity and low-fidelity simulators in a selection center environment,
      using measures of construct and concurrent validity. METHODS: A total of 46
      novice and expert participants were tested on both the low-fidelity Fundamentals 
      of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) box trainer and the high fidelity, Lapsim, virtual 
      reality laparoscopic simulator. Outcome scores and performance metrics where
      recorded. RESULTS: Experts performed better than novices on the FLS (median 71%
      vs. 51%; P<0.0001) but not the Lapsim (59.1% vs. 57.1%; P = 0.41). No correlation
      was found between overall Lapsim metrics and FLS outcome scores (correlation =
      -0.024; P = 0.874). Although most novice participants performed within a narrow
      window on the FLS simulator, a few high-performing and low-performing outliers
      where identified. CONCLUSIONS: In a selection center scenario, testing with
      low-fidelity platforms appears to demonstrate greater validity. Outliers can be
      identified using low-fidelity simulators.

TI  - Preconditioning in laparoscopic surgery--results of a virtual reality pilot
      study.
PG  - 889-95
LID - 10.1007/s00423-014-1224-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This prospective study investigated the effect of preconditioning in 
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and appendectomy (LA) based on pre- and
      postoperative virtual reality laparoscopy (VRL) performances, with specific
      regard to the impact of different motor skills, types of surgery and levels of
      experience. STUDY DESIGN: Forty laparoscopic procedures (28 LC and 12 LA) were
      performed by 13 residents in the operating room. Participants completed a defined
      set of tasks on the VRL simulator directly prior to and after the operation: one 
      preparational task (PT), a virtual procedural task with emphasis on fine
      preparation (VPT) and a navigational manoeuvre for instrument coordination (ICT).
      VRL performances were evaluated based on the assessed items of the simulator.
      RESULTS: Overall analysis of the surgeons' performance demonstrated better
      postoperative results for PT and VPT in 28 and 26 cases (p = 0.001 and p =
      0.034), respectively. No significant difference was found for ICT (p = 0.638).
      Less-experienced residents had better postoperative results for PT and VPT (p =
      0.009 and p = 0.041), whereas more-experienced surgeons had better postoperative 
      results for PT only (p = 0.030). LC resulted in better postoperative performance 
      for PT (p = 0.007). LA improved performance for PT and VPT (p = 0.034 and p =
      0.006, respectively). Comparisons of surgeon's experience demonstrated a
      significant advantage for more-experienced surgeons in ICT (p = 0.033), while
      type of surgery showed an advantage for LA in VPT (p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: There 
      is a preconditioning effect in laparoscopic surgery. The differing results
      related to LC and LA and the experience levels of surgeons suggest that
      differentiated warm-up strategies are required.

TI  - Virtual-world hospital simulation for real-world disaster response: Design and
      validation of a virtual reality simulator for mass casualty incident management.
PG  - 315-21
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000000308 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mass casualty incidents are unfortunately becoming more common. The
      coordination of mass casualty incident response is highly complex. Currently
      available options for training, however, are limited by either lack of realism or
      prohibitive expense and by a lack of assessment tools. Virtual worlds represent a
      potentially cost-effective, immersive, and easily accessible platform for
      training and assessment. The aim of this study was to assess feasibility of a
      novel virtual-worlds-based system for assessment and training in major incident
      response. METHODS: Clinical areas were modeled within a virtual, online hospital.
      A major incident, incorporating virtual casualties, allowed multiple clinicians
      to simultaneously respond with appropriate in-world management and transfer plans
      within limits of the hospital's available resources. Errors, delays, and
      completed actions were recorded, as well as Trauma-NOnTECHnical Skills
      (T-NOTECHS) score. Performance was compared between novice and expert clinician
      groups. RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects participated in three simulations: pilot (n 
      = 7), novice (n = 8), and expert groups (n = 6). The novices committed more
      critical events than the experts, 11 versus 3, p = 0.006; took longer to treat
      patients, 560 (299) seconds versus 339 (321) seconds, p = 0.026; and achieved
      poorer T-NOTECHS scores, 14 (2) versus 21.5 (3.7), p = 0.003, and technical
      skill, 2.29 (0.34) versus 3.96 (0.69), p = 0.001. One hundred percent of the
      subjects thought that the simulation was realistic and superior to existing
      training options. CONCLUSION: A virtual-worlds-based model for the training and
      assessment of major incident response has been designed and validated. The
      advantages of customizability, reproducibility, and recordability combined with
      the low cost of implementation suggest that this potentially represents a
      powerful adjunct to existing training methods and may be applicable to further
      areas of surgery as well.

TI  - Basic endovascular skills for trauma course: bridging the gap between
      endovascular techniques and the acute care surgeon.
PG  - 286-91
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000000310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of catheter-based skills is increasing in the field of
      vascular trauma. Virtual reality simulation (VRS) is a well-established means of 
      endovascular skills training, and potentially lifesaving skills such as
      resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) may be obtained
      through VRS. METHODS: Thirteen faculty members in the Division of Trauma and
      Critical Care performed REBOA six times on the Vascular Intervention System
      Training Simulator-C after a didactic and instructional session. Subjects were
      excluded if they had taken a similar endovascular training course, had additional
      training in endovascular surgery, or had performed this procedure in the clinical
      setting. Performance metrics included procedural time; accurate placement of
      guide wire, sheath, and balloon; correct sequence of steps; economy of motion;
      and safe use of endovascular tools. A precourse and postcourse test and
      questionnaire were performed by each subject. RESULTS: Significant improvements
      in knowledge (p = 0.0013) and procedural task times (p < 0.0001) were observed at
      the completion of the course. No correlation was observed with endovascular
      experience in residency, number of central and arterial catheters placed weekly, 
      or other parameters. All trainees strongly agreed that the course was beneficial,
      and the majority would recommend this training to other acute care surgeons.
      CONCLUSION: Damage control endovascular procedures can be effectively taught
      using VRS. Significant improvements in procedural time and knowledge can be
      achieved regardless of endovascular experience in residency, years since
      residency, or other parameters. Novice interventionalists (acute care surgeons)
      can add a specific skill set (REBOA) to their existing core competencies, which
      has the potential to improve the survival and/or outcomes of severely injured
      patients.

TI  - Mixed reality ventriculostomy simulation: experience in neurosurgical residency.
PG  - 576-81; discussion 581
LID - 10.1227/NEU.0000000000000503 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medicine and surgery are turning toward simulation to improve on
      limited patient interaction during residency training. Many simulators today use 
      virtual reality with augmented haptic feedback with little to no physical
      elements. In a collaborative effort, the University of Florida Department of
      Neurosurgery and the Center for Safety, Simulation & Advanced Learning
      Technologies created a novel "mixed" physical and virtual simulator to mimic the 
      ventriculostomy procedure. The simulator contains all the physical components
      encountered for the procedure with superimposed 3-D virtual elements for the
      neuroanatomical structures. OBJECTIVE: To introduce the ventriculostomy simulator
      and its validation as a necessary training tool in neurosurgical residency.
      METHODS: We tested the simulator in more than 260 residents. An algorithm
      combining time and accuracy was used to grade performance. Voluntary
      postperformance surveys were used to evaluate the experience. RESULTS: Results
      demonstrate that more experienced residents have statistically significant better
      scores and completed the procedure in less time than inexperienced residents.
      Survey results revealed that most residents agreed that practice on the simulator
      would help with future ventriculostomies. CONCLUSION: This mixed reality
      simulator provides a real-life experience, and will be an instrumental tool in
      training the next generation of neurosurgeons. We have now implemented a standard
      where incoming residents must prove efficiency and skill on the simulator before 
      their first interaction with a patient.

TI  - Mastoidectomy performance assessment of virtual simulation training using
      final-product analysis.
PG  - 431-5
LID - 10.1002/lary.24838 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The future development of integrated automatic assessment 
      in temporal bone virtual surgical simulators calls for validation against
      currently established assessment tools. This study aimed to explore the
      relationship between mastoidectomy final-product performance assessment in
      virtual simulation and traditional dissection training. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective
      trial with blinding. METHODS: A total of 34 novice residents performed a
      mastoidectomy on the Visible Ear Simulator and on a cadaveric temporal bone. Two 
      blinded senior otologists assessed the final-product performance using a modified
      Welling scale. The simulator gathered basic metrics on time, steps, and volumes
      in relation to the on-screen tutorial and collisions with vital structures.
      RESULTS: Substantial inter-rater reliability (kappa = 0.77) for virtual
      simulation and moderate inter-rater reliability (kappa = 0.59) for dissection
      final-product assessment was found. The simulation and dissection performance
      scores had significant correlation (P = .014). None of the basic simulator
      metrics correlated significantly with the final-product score except for number
      of steps completed in the simulator. CONCLUSIONS: A modified version of a
      validated final-product performance assessment tool can be used to assess
      mastoidectomy on virtual temporal bones. Performance assessment of virtual
      mastoidectomy could potentially save the use of cadaveric temporal bones for more
      advanced training when a basic level of competency in simulation has been
      achieved. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.

TI  - Augmented reality in the surgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations:
      technique assessment and considerations.
PG  - 1769-74
LID - 10.1007/s00701-014-2183-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Augmented reality technology has been used for intraoperative image
      guidance through the overlay of virtual images, from preoperative imaging
      studies, onto the real-world surgical field. Although setups based on augmented
      reality have been used for various neurosurgical pathologies, very few cases have
      been reported for the surgery of arteriovenous malformations (AVM). We present
      our experience with AVM surgery using a system designed for image injection of
      virtual images into the operating microscope's eyepiece, and discuss why
      augmented reality may be less appealing in this form of surgery. METHODS: N = 5
      patients underwent AVM resection assisted by augmented reality. Virtual
      three-dimensional models of patients' heads, skulls, AVM nidi, and feeder and
      drainage vessels were selectively segmented and injected into the microscope's
      eyepiece for intraoperative image guidance, and their usefulness was assessed in 
      each case. RESULTS: Although the setup helped in performing tailored
      craniotomies, in guiding dissection and in localizing drainage veins, it did not 
      provide the surgeon with useful information concerning feeder arteries, due to
      the complexity of AVM angioarchitecture. CONCLUSION: The difficulty in
      intraoperatively conveying useful information on feeder vessels may make
      augmented reality a less engaging tool in this form of surgery, and might explain
      its underrepresentation in the literature. Integrating an AVM's hemodynamic
      characteristics into the augmented rendering could make it more suited to AVM
      surgery.

TI  - Validation of the ArthroS virtual reality simulator for arthroscopic skills.
PG  - 3436-42
LID - 10.1007/s00167-014-3101-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Virtual reality simulator training has become important for acquiring
      arthroscopic skills. A new simulator for knee arthroscopy ArthroS has been
      developed. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate face and construct
      validity, executed according to a protocol used previously to validate
      arthroscopic simulators. METHODS: Twenty-seven participants were divided into
      three groups having different levels of arthroscopic experience. Participants
      answered questions regarding general information and the outer appearance of the 
      simulator for face validity. Construct validity was assessed with one
      standardized navigation task. Face validity, educational value and user
      friendliness were further determined by giving participants three exercises and
      by asking them to fill out the questionnaire. RESULTS: Construct validity was
      demonstrated between experts and beginners. Median task times were not
      significantly different for all repetitions between novices and intermediates,
      and between intermediates and experts. Median face validity was 8.3 for the outer
      appearance, 6.5 for the intra-articular joint and 4.7 for surgical instruments.
      Educational value and user friendliness were perceived as nonsatisfactory,
      especially because of the lack of tactile feedback. CONCLUSION: The ArthroS
      demonstrated construct validity between novices and experts, but did not
      demonstrate full face validity. Future improvements should be mainly focused on
      the development of tactile feedback. It is necessary that a newly presented
      simulator is validated to prove it actually contributes to proficiency of skills.

TI  - Flat-floored air-lifted platform: a new method for combining behavior with
      microscopy or electrophysiology on awake freely moving rodents.
PG  - e51869
LID - 10.3791/51869 [doi]
AB  - It is widely acknowledged that the use of general anesthetics can undermine the
      relevance of electrophysiological or microscopical data obtained from a living
      animal's brain. Moreover, the lengthy recovery from anesthesia limits the
      frequency of repeated recording/imaging episodes in longitudinal studies. Hence, 
      new methods that would allow stable recordings from non-anesthetized behaving
      mice are expected to advance the fields of cellular and cognitive neurosciences. 
      Existing solutions range from mere physical restraint to more sophisticated
      approaches, such as linear and spherical treadmills used in combination with
      computer-generated virtual reality. Here, a novel method is described where a
      head-fixed mouse can move around an air-lifted mobile homecage and explore its
      environment under stress-free conditions. This method allows researchers to
      perform behavioral tests (e.g., learning, habituation or novel object
      recognition) simultaneously with two-photon microscopic imaging and/or
      patch-clamp recordings, all combined in a single experiment. This video-article
      describes the use of the awake animal head fixation device (mobile homecage),
      demonstrates the procedures of animal habituation, and exemplifies a number of
      possible applications of the method.

TI  - Single-session baseline virtual reality simulator scores predict technical
      performance for laparoscopic colectomy: a study in the swine model.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Virtual reality (VR) simulation helps reducing the learning curve of
      laparoscopic colectomy. Moreover, it may be used to ascertain surgeons'
      pretraining skills. It was aimed to establish predictive validity of specific
      parameters gathered during VR simulation training on sigmoid colectomy and
      whether simulator parameters correlate with technical performance during the same
      operation in a swine model. DESIGN: Surgeons novice to laparoscopic colectomy
      underwent a single VR simulation session on sigmoid colectomy. Next, all
      participants performed a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy in the swine. Operations were
      recorded. Performance evaluation was conducted by 2 board-certified colorectal
      surgeons blinded to surgeons' simulator scores using an instrument specific to
      laparoscopic colectomy. For each participant, a mean score of specific skills was
      calculated. Linear regression analysis was used to identify simulator parameters 
      that were best related to the score. The stepwise method was used to select
      parameters. The magnitude of the regression model was measured by the coefficient
      of determination (R(2)) value. SETTING: The University of Sao Paulo Medical
      Center is a high-volume, public practice, university-affiliated hospital.
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14 first-year residents in digestive tract surgery were 
      included. RESULTS: Analysis of variance demonstrated that the regression model
      was significant (p = 0.0001), and an association between simulation scores and
      specific skills was confirmed. The R(2) value was 99%. The VR simulator
      parameters that strongly correlated with specific skills during laparoscopic
      colectomy in the swine were safe use of electrosurgery/energy device and safety
      of medial-to-lateral dissection. CONCLUSIONS: A single VR simulation session for 
      novice surgeons in the sigmoid colectomy module generates baseline scores that
      highly correlated with performance of specific skills during a laparoscopic
      colectomy in the swine. This information may be useful in an attempt to tailor VR
      simulator practice according to a surgeon's needs.

TI  - Assessing Performance in Shoulder Arthroscopy: The Imperial Global Arthroscopy
      Rating Scale (IGARS).
PG  - e112
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical training is undergoing major changes with reduced resident
      work hours and an increasing focus on patient safety and surgical aptitude. The
      aim of this study was to create a valid, reliable method for an assessment of
      arthroscopic skills that is independent of time and place and is designed for
      both real and simulated settings. The validity of the scale was tested using a
      virtual reality shoulder arthroscopy simulator.METHODS: The study consisted of
      two parts. In the first part, an Imperial Global Arthroscopy Rating Scale for
      assessing technical performance was developed using a Delphi method. Application 
      of this scale required installing a dual-camera system to synchronously record
      the simulator screen and body movements of trainees to allow an assessment that
      is independent of time and place. The scale includes aspects such as efficient
      portal positioning, angles of instrument insertion, proficiency in handling the
      arthroscope and adequately manipulating the camera, and triangulation skills. In 
      the second part of the study, a validation study was conducted. Two experienced
      arthroscopic surgeons, blinded to the identities and experience of the
      participants, each assessed forty-nine subjects performing three different tests 
      using the Imperial Global Arthroscopy Rating Scale. Results were analyzed using
      two-way analysis of variance with measures of absolute agreement. The intraclass 
      correlation coefficient was calculated for each test to assess inter-rater
      reliability.RESULTS: The scale demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach
      alpha, 0.918). The intraclass correlation coefficient demonstrated high agreement
      between the assessors: 0.91 (p < 0.001). Construct validity was evaluated using
      Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (chi-square test, 29.826; p < 0.001),
      demonstrating that the Imperial Global Arthroscopy Rating Scale distinguishes
      significantly between subjects with different levels of experience utilizing a
      virtual reality simulator.CONCLUSIONS: The Imperial Global Arthroscopy Rating
      Scale has a high internal consistency and excellent inter-rater reliability and
      offers an approach for assessing technical performance in basic arthroscopy on a 
      virtual reality simulator.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The Imperial Global Arthroscopy
      Rating Scale provides detailed information on surgical skills. Although it
      requires further validation in the operating room, this scale, which is
      independent of time and place, offers a robust and reliable method for assessing 
      arthroscopic technical skills.

TI  - A study of the effect of dyad practice versus that of individual practice on
      simulation-based complex skills learning and of students' perceptions of how and 
      why dyad practice contributes to learning.
PG  - 1287-94
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0000000000000373 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aims of this study were (1) to explore the effectiveness of dyad
      practice compared with individual practice on a simulator for learning a complex 
      clinical skill and (2) to explore medical students' perceptions of how and why
      dyad practice on a simulator contributes to learning a complex skill. METHOD: In 
      2011, the authors randomly assigned 84 medical students to either the dyad or the
      individual practice group to learn coronary angiography skills using instruction 
      videos and a simulator. Two weeks later, participants each performed two
      video-recorded coronary angiographies on the simulator. Two raters used a rating 
      scale to assess the participants' video-recorded performance. The authors then
      interviewed the participants in the dyad practice group. RESULTS: Seventy-two
      (86%) participants completed the study. The authors found no significant
      difference between the performance scores of the two groups (mean+/-standard
      deviation, 68%+/-13% for individual versus 63%+/-16% for dyad practice; P=.18).
      Dyad practice participants noted that several key factors contributed to their
      learning: being equal-level novices, the quality of the cooperation between
      partners, observational learning and overt communication, social aspects and
      motivation, and meta-cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Dyad practice is more efficient and 
      thus more cost-effective than individual practice and can be used for costly
      virtual reality simulator training. However, dyad practice may not apply to
      clinical training involving real patients because learning from errors and overt 
      communication, both keys to dyad practice, do not transfer to clinical practice.

TI  - The Tube 3 module designed for practicing vesicourethral anastomosis in a virtual
      reality robotic simulator: determination of face, content, and construct
      validity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To better use virtual reality robotic simulators and offer surgeons
      more practical exercises, we developed the Tube 3 module for practicing
      vesicourethral anastomosis (VUA), one of the most complex steps in the
      robot-assisted radical prostatectomy procedure. Herein, we describe the principle
      of the Tube 3 module and evaluate its face, content, and construct validity.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Residents and attending surgeons participated in a
      prospective study approved by the institutional review board. We divided subjects
      into 2 groups, those with experience and novices. Each subject performed a
      simulated VUA using the Tube 3 module. A built-in scoring algorithm recorded the 
      data from each performance. After completing the Tube 3 module exercise, each
      subject answered a questionnaire to provide data to be used for face and content 
      validation. RESULTS: The novice group consisted of 10 residents. The experienced 
      subjects (n = 10) had each previously performed at least 10 robotic surgeries.
      The experienced group outperformed the novice group in most variables, including 
      task time, total score, total economy of motion, and number of instrument
      collisions (P <.05). Additionally, 80% of the experienced surgeons agreed that
      the module reflects the technical skills required to perform VUA and would be a
      useful training tool. CONCLUSION: We describe the Tube 3 module for practicing
      VUA, which showed excellent face, content, and construct validity. The task needs
      to be refined in the future to reflect VUA under real operating conditions, and
      concurrent and predictive validity studies are currently underway.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop content for a basic laparoscopic curriculum in gynaecology.
      STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional observational study. Modified Delphi
      method with three iterations undertaken by an invited group of national experts
      across the United Kingdom (UK). Two anonymous online surveys and a final physical
      group meeting were undertaken. Junior trainees in gynaecology undertook a
      parallel iteration of the Delphi process for external validation. Population
      included: expert panel - certified specialists in minimal-access gynaecological
      surgery, RCOG national senior trainee representatives, and medical
      educationalists, junior trainees group - regional trainees in gynaecology in
      first and second year of speciality training. RESULTS: Experts (n=37) reached
      fair to almost complete significant agreement (kappa=0.100-0.8159; p<0.05) on
      eight out of nine questions by the second iteration. Trainees (n=19) agreed with 
      the experts on 89% (51/57) of categories to be included in the curriculum.
      Findings indicated that 39 categories should be included in the curriculum. Port 
      placement, laparoscopic equipment and patient selection were ranked the most
      important theoretical categories. Hand-eye co-ordination, camera navigation and
      entry techniques were deemed the most valuable skills. Diagnostic laparoscopy,
      laparoscopic sterilisation, and laparoscopic salpingectomy were the operations
      agreed to be most important for inclusion. Simulation training was agreed as the 
      method of skill development. The expert panel favoured box trainers, whereas the 
      junior trainee group preferred virtual reality simulators. A basic simulation
      laparoscopic hand-eye co-ordination test was proposed as a final assessment of
      competence in the curriculum. CONCLUSION: Consensus was achieved on the content
      of a basic laparoscopic curriculum in gynaecology, in a cost- and time-effective,
      scientific process. The Delphi method provided a simple, structured consumer
      approach to curriculum development that combined views of trainers and trainees
      that could be used to develop curricula in other areas of post-graduate
      education.

TI  - Three-dimensional virtual reality simulation of periarticular tumors using
      Dextroscope reconstruction and simulated surgery: a preliminary 10-case study.
PG  - 1043-50
LID - 10.12659/MSM.889770 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dextroscope(R) three-dimensional (3D) imaging has been extensively
      used to generate virtual reality (VR) workspaces for neurosurgery and
      laparoscopy, but few applications have been reported for orthopedic surgery.
      Here, we investigated orthopedic periarticular tumor surgery planning and
      anatomical characteristics using a Dextroscope. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients
      undergoing surgery for periarticular tumors (n=10) between October 2008 and June 
      2010 were enrolled and presurgically subjected to computed tomography (CT),
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and MRI angiography (MRI-A). Imaging data were 
      transferred and integrated in a Dextroscope to produce a VR simulation. The
      presurgical 3D anatomical reconstructions and intraoperative anatomical
      characteristics (virtual vs. actual data) and surgical approach (virtual vs.
      actual situation) measurement and subjective appearance were compared. RESULTS:
      Anatomical characteristics in the area of interest and tumor diameters in all 3
      planes (superior-inferior, medial-lateral, and anteroposterior) were consistent
      between virtual and actual data (3.92+/-1.22, 1.96+/-0.53, and 1.73+/-0.44 vs.
      3.92+/-1.13, 1.91+/-0.44, and 1.81+/-0.41; P=0.99, 0.24, and 0.09, respectively).
      However, the virtual surgical situations were inconsistent with the actual
      intraoperative situation in many cases, leading to complications. The resolutions
      of the original CT, MRI, and MRI-A images directly correlated with 3D simulation 
      quality, with soft tissues most poorly represented. Tumor tissue imaging quality 
      in 3D varied extensively by tumor type. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomical structures of
      periarticular tumors can be reconstructed using the Dextroscope system with good 
      accuracy in the case of simple fenestration, increasing treatment
      individualization, surgical competence level, and potentially reducing
      intraoperative complications. However, further specialization of VR tools for use
      in orthopedic applications that involve specialized tools and procedures, such as
      drilling and implant placement, are urgently need.

TI  - Development and testing of an endoscopic pseudo-viewpoint alternating system.
PG  - 619-28
LID - 10.1007/s11548-014-1083-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: An endoscopic system is needed that presents informative images
      irrespective of the surgical situation and the number of degrees of freedom in
      endoscopic manipulation. This goal may be achieved with a virtual reality view
      for a region of interest from an arbitrary viewpoint. An endoscopic
      pseudo-viewpoint alternation system for this purpose was developed and tested.
      METHOD: Surgical experts and trainees from an endoscopic surgery training course 
      at the minimally invasive surgery training center of Kyushu University were
      enrolled in a trial of a virtual reality system. The initial viewpoint was
      positioned to approximate the horizontal view often seen in laparoscopic surgery,
      with [Formula: see text] between the optical axis of the endoscope and the task
      surface. A right-to-left suturing task with right hand, based on a task from the 
      endoscopic surgery training course, was selected for testing. We compared task
      outcomes with and without use of a new virtual reality-viewing system. RESULT:
      There was a 0.37 mm reduction in total error ([Formula: see text]) with use of
      the proposed system. Error reduction was composed of 0.1 mm reduction on the
      y-axis and 0.27 mm reduction on the x-axis. Experts benefited more than novices
      from use of the proposed system. Most subjects worked at a pseudo-viewpoint of
      around 34[Formula: see text]. DISCUSSION: Suturing performance improved with the 
      new virtual reality endoscopic display system. Viewpoint alternation resulted in 
      an overview that improved depth perception and allowed subjects to better aim the
      marker. This suggests the proposed method offers users better visualization and
      control in endoscopic surgery.

TI  - The use of simulation in neurosurgical education and training. A systematic
      review.
PG  - 228-46
LID - 10.3171/2014.5.JNS131766 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: There is increasing evidence that simulation provides high-quality,
      time-effective training in an era of resident duty-hour restrictions. Simulation 
      may also permit trainees to acquire key skills in a safe environment, important
      in a specialty such as neurosurgery, where technical error can result in
      devastating consequences. The authors systematically reviewed the application of 
      simulation within neurosurgical training and explored the state of the art in
      simulation within this specialty. To their knowledge this is the first systematic
      review published on this topic to date. METHODS: The authors searched the Ovid
      MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases and identified 4101 articles; 195
      abstracts were screened by 2 authors for inclusion. The authors reviewed data on 
      study population, study design and setting, outcome measures, key findings, and
      limitations. RESULTS: Twenty-eight articles formed the basis of this systematic
      review. Several different simulators are at the neurosurgeon's disposal,
      including those for ventriculostomy, neuroendoscopic procedures, and spinal
      surgery, with evidence for improved performance in a range of procedures.
      Feedback from participants has generally been favorable. However, study quality
      was found to be poor overall, with many studies hampered by nonrandomized design,
      presenting normal rather than abnormal anatomy, lack of control groups and
      long-term follow-up, poor study reporting, lack of evidence of improved simulator
      performance translating into clinical benefit, and poor reliability and validity 
      evidence. The mean Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument score of
      included studies was 9.21 +/- 1.95 (+/- SD) out of a possible score of 18.
      CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrate qualitative and quantitative benefits of a
      range of neurosurgical simulators but find significant shortfalls in methodology 
      and design. Future studies should seek to improve study design and reporting, and
      provide long-term follow-up data on simulated and ideally patient outcomes.

PG  - 3343-8
LID - 10.1007/s00464-014-3624-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The clinical application of robotic surgery is increasing. The
      skills necessary to perform robotic surgery are unique from those required in
      open and laparoscopic surgery. A validated laparoscopic surgical skills
      curriculum (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery or FLS) has transformed the way 
      surgeons acquire laparoscopic skills. There is a need for a similar skills
      training and assessment tool for robotic surgery. Our research group previously
      developed and validated a robotic training curriculum in a virtual reality (VR)
      simulator. We hypothesized that novice robotic surgeons could achieve proficiency
      levels defined by more experienced robotic surgeons on the VR robotic curriculum,
      and that this would result in improved performance on the actual daVinci Surgical
      System. METHODS: 25 medical students with no prior robotic surgery experience
      were recruited. Prior to VR training, subjects performed 2 FLS tasks 3 times each
      (Peg Transfer, Intracorporeal Knot Tying) using the daVinci Surgical System
      docked to a video trainer box. Task performance for the FLS tasks was scored
      objectively. Subjects then practiced on the VR simulator (daVinci Skills
      Simulator) until proficiency levels on all 5 tasks were achieved before
      completing a post-training assessment of the 2 FLS tasks on the daVinci Surgical 
      System in the video trainer box. RESULTS: All subjects to complete the study (1
      dropped out) reached proficiency levels on all VR tasks in an average of 71 (+/- 
      21.7) attempts, accumulating 164.3 (+/- 55.7) minutes of console training time.
      There was a significant improvement in performance on the robotic FLS tasks
      following completion of the VR training curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: Novice robotic
      surgeons are able to attain proficiency levels on a VR simulator. This leads to
      improved performance in the daVinci surgical platform on simulated tasks.
      Training to proficiency on a VR robotic surgery simulator is an efficient and
      viable method for acquiring robotic surgical skills.

PG  - 234-9
LID - 10.4253/wjge.v6.i6.234 [doi]
AB  - The use of simulation based training in endoscopy has been increasingly
      described, simulation has the potential reduce the harm caused to patients by
      novices performing procedures, increase efficiency by reducing the time needed to
      train in the clinical environment and increase the opportunity to repeatedly
      practice rare procedures as well as allowing the assessment of performance.
      Simulators can consist of mechanical devices, employ cadaveric animal tissue or
      use virtual reality technology. Simulators have been used to teach upper and
      lower gastrointestinal endoscopy as well as interventional procedures. This
      review reviews the currently available endoscopic simulators, and the evidence
      for their efficacy, demonstrating that the ability of simulators to differentiate
      between novice and expert endoscopists is well established. There is limited
      evidence for improved patient outcome as a result of simulation training. We also
      consider how the environment within which a simulation is placed can be
      manipulated to alter the learning achieved, broadening the scope of simulation to
      develop communication as well as technical skills. Finally the implications for
      future practice are considered; technology is likely improve the fidelity of
      simulators, increasing the potential for simulation to improve patient outcomes. 
      The impact of the simulation environment, and the correct place of simulation
      within the training curriculum are both issues which need addressing.

AB  - PCNL is a endourological technique for the treatment of kidney stones disease.
      It's aim is to achieve the complete clearance via a percutaneous access. This
      technique, as we know it today, was developed by Johanson and Fernstrom in 1976
      who used the technological advances in percutaneous fluoroscopy to get the
      percutaneous access. Following the application of various sources of energy for
      the fragmentation of the calculi such as ultrasound energy, there was the
      worldwide diffusion of PCNL thanks to Alken and Marbergen in Europe, Segura and
      Clayman in the USA. Despite in the early '80s the PCNL lost the initial impulse
      in favor of the SWL, in the '90s, it revived a second golden age through the
      application of emerging technologies such as computed tomography, techniques of
      obtaining the percutaneous access, flexible instrumentation, laser energy and,
      more recently, robotic surgery, and virtual reality. All of these contributed to 
      bring the PCNL on the road up of the mini-invasiveness to the latest development 
      of Microperc. The Microperc allows the treatment of stones of 2 cm in diameter
      also, obtaining the access under ultrasound, fluoroscopic and direct vision
      guidance. A complete system including micor-optics, laser fiber and irrigation
      system is then inserted into the same needle with a diameter of 4.85, 8 or 10 Fr 
      The CROES used logistic developments by creating a global network and a
      multi-center database. The PCNL study, concluded in 2009, has led to the
      publication of as many as 27 scientific papers on this subject.

TI  - Effect of virtual reality distraction on pain among patients with hand injury
      undergoing dressing change.
PG  - 115-20
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12626 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of virtual reality distraction on pain 
      among patients with a hand injury undergoing a dressing change. BACKGROUND:
      Virtual reality distraction can effectively alleviate pain among patients
      undergoing a dressing change. Clinical research has not addressed pain control
      during a dressing change. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial was performed.
      METHODS: In the first dressing change sequence, 98 patients were randomly divided
      into an experimental group and a control group, with 49 cases in each group. Pain
      levels were compared between the two groups before and after the dressing change 
      using a visual analog scale. The sense of involvement in virtual environments was
      measured using the Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, which determined the
      relationship between the sense of involvement and pain level. RESULTS: The
      difference in visual analog scale scores between the two groups before the
      dressing change was not statistically significant (t = 0.196, p > 0.05), but the 
      scores became statistically significant after the dressing change (t = -30.792, p
      < 0.01). The correlation between the sense of involvement in a virtual
      environment and pain level during the dressing was statistically significant
      (R(2) = 0.5538, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Virtual reality distraction can
      effectively alleviate pain among patients with a hand injury undergoing a
      dressing change. Better results can be obtained by increasing the sense of
      involvement in a virtual environment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Virtual
      reality distraction can effectively relieve pain without side effects and is not 
      reliant on a doctor's prescription. This tool is convenient for nurses to use,
      especially when analgesics are unavailable.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dizziness is a major consequence of imbalance and
      vestibular dysfunction. Compared to surgery and drug treatments, balance training
      is non-invasive and more desired. However, training exercises are usually tedious
      and the assessment tool is insufficient to diagnose patient's severity rapidly.
      METHODS: An interactive virtual reality (VR) game-based rehabilitation program
      that adopted Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises, and a sensor-based measuring system
      were introduced. To verify the therapeutic effect, a clinical experiment with 48 
      patients and 36 normal subjects was conducted. Quantified balance indices were
      measured and analyzed by statistical tools and a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
      classifier. RESULTS: In terms of balance indices, patients who completed the
      training process are progressed and the difference between normal subjects and
      patients is obvious. CONCLUSIONS: Further analysis by SVM classifier show that
      the accuracy of recognizing the differences between patients and normal subject
      is feasible, and these results can be used to evaluate patients' severity and
      make rapid assessment.

LID - 10.1089/cyber.2014.0198 [doi]
AB  - Surgical anxiety creates psychological and physiological stress, causes
      complications in surgical procedures, and prolongs recovery. Relaxation of
      patients in postoperative intensive care units can moderate patient vital signs
      and reduce discomfort. This experiment explores the use of virtual reality (VR)
      cybertherapy to reduce postoperative distress in patients that have recently
      undergone cardiac surgery. Sixty-seven patients were monitored at IMSS La Raza
      National Medical Center within 24 hours of cardiac surgery. Patients navigated
      through a 30 minute VR simulation designed for pain management. Results were
      analyzed through comparison of pre- and postoperative vital signs and Likert
      scale survey data. A connection was found in several physiological factors with
      subjective responses from the Likert scale survey. Heavy positive correlation
      existed between breathing rate and Likert ratings, and a moderate correlation was
      found between mean arterial pressure and Likert ratings and heart rate and Likert
      ratings, all of which indicated lower pain and stress within patients. Further
      study of these factors resulted in the categorization of patients based upon
      their vital signs and subjective response, providing a context for the
      effectiveness of the therapy to specific groups of patients.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) has been used by clinicians to manage pain in clinical
      populations. This study examines the use of VR as a form of distraction for
      dental patients using both subjective and objective measures to determine how a
      VR system affects patients' reported anxiety level, pain level, and physiological
      factors. As predicted, results of self-evaluation questionnaires showed that
      patients experienced less anxiety and pain after undergoing VR treatment.
      Physiological data reported similar trends in decreased anxiety. Overall, the
      favorable subjective and objective responses suggest that VR distraction systems 
      can reduce discomfort and pain for patients with mild to moderate fear and
      anxiety.

TI  - Constraint-based soft tissue simulation for virtual surgical training.
PG  - 2698-706
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2014.2326009 [doi]
AB  - Most of surgical simulators employ a linear elastic model to simulate soft tissue
      material properties due to its computational efficiency and the simplicity.
      However, soft tissues often have elaborate nonlinear material characteristics.
      Most prominently, soft tissues are soft and compliant to small strains, but after
      initial deformations they are very resistant to further deformations even under
      large forces. Such material characteristic is referred as the nonlinear material 
      incompliant which is computationally expensive and numerically difficult to
      simulate. This paper presents a constraint-based finite-element algorithm to
      simulate the nonlinear incompliant tissue materials efficiently for interactive
      simulation applications such as virtual surgery. Firstly, the proposed algorithm 
      models the material stiffness behavior of soft tissues with a set of 3-D strain
      limit constraints on deformation strain tensors. By enforcing a large number of
      geometric constraints to achieve the material stiffness, the algorithm reduces
      the task of solving stiff equations of motion with a general numerical solver to 
      iteratively resolving a set of constraints with a nonlinear Gauss-Seidel
      iterative process. Secondly, as a Gauss-Seidel method processes constraints
      individually, in order to speed up the global convergence of the large
      constrained system, a multiresolution hierarchy structure is also used to
      accelerate the computation significantly, making interactive simulations possible
      at a high level of details. Finally, this paper also presents a simple-to-build
      data acquisition system to validate simulation results with ex vivo tissue
      measurements. An interactive virtual reality-based simulation system is also
      demonstrated.

TI  - Tissue surface information for intraoperative incision planning and focus
      adjustment in laser surgery.
PG  - 171-81
LID - 10.1007/s11548-014-1077-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Introducing computational methods to laser surgery are an emerging
      field. Focusing on endoscopic laser interventions, a novel approach is presented 
      to enhance intraoperative incision planning and laser focusing by means of tissue
      surface information obtained by stereoscopic vision. METHODS: Tissue surface is
      estimated with stereo-based methods using nonparametric image transforms.
      Subsequently, laser-to-camera registration is obtained by ablating a pattern on
      tissue substitutes and performing a principle component analysis for precise
      laser axis estimation. Furthermore, a virtual laser view is computed utilizing
      trifocal transfer. Depth-based laser focus adaptation is integrated into a custom
      experimental laser setup in order to achieve optimal ablation morphology.
      Experimental validation is conducted on tissue substitutes and ex vivo animal
      tissue. RESULTS: Laser-to-camera registration gives an error between planning and
      ablation of less than 0.2 mm. As a result, the laser workspace can accurately be 
      highlighted within the live views and incision planning can directly be
      performed. Experiments related to laser focus adaptation demonstrate that
      ablation geometry can be kept almost uniform within a depth range of 7.9 mm,
      whereas cutting quality significantly decreases when the laser is defocused.
      CONCLUSIONS: An automatic laser focus adjustment on tissue surfaces based on
      stereoscopic scene information is feasible and has the potential to become an
      effective methodology for optimal ablation. Laser-to-camera registration
      facilitates advanced surgical planning for prospective user interfaces and
      augmented reality extensions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Work hour restrictions and current quality, financial, and legal
      concerns have reduced resident operative volume and autonomy. Although laboratory
      (cadaveric or animal) dissection has a rich history in neurosurgery, its current 
      role in resident training is unclear. Recent literature suggests educators have
      looked to simulation to accelerate the learning curve of acquiring neurosurgical 
      technical skills. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence,
      characteristics, and extent of laboratory dissection in neurosurgical residency
      programs in the United States. METHODS: A survey was sent to program directors of
      all 100 neurosurgical residency programs in the United States. RESULTS: Response 
      rate was 65%. Most programs (93.8%) incorporate laboratory dissection into
      resident training. Most programs have 1-3 (36.1%) or 4-6 (39.3%) sessions
      annually. Residents in postgraduate years 2-6 (85.2%-93.4%) most commonly
      participate. The most common topics are cranial approaches (100%), spinal
      approaches (88.5%), spine instrumentation (80.3%), and endoscopy (50.8%).
      Thirty-one (47.7%) programs use artificial physical model or virtual reality
      simulators; the most common simulators are endoscopy (15.4%), microvascular
      anastomosis (13.8%), and endovascular (10.8%). Only 8 programs (13.1%) formally
      grade dissection skills. Educators (95.4%) believe laboratory dissection is an
      integral component of training and no respondent believed simulation could
      currently provide greater educational benefit than laboratory dissection. Most
      (89.2%) respondents would support a national "suggested" dissection curriculum
      and manual. CONCLUSIONS: In neurosurgical resident education, laboratory
      dissection is widely used; however, significant variation exists. Nonetheless,
      program directors believe laboratory dissection plays an integral role in
      neurosurgical training and is currently associated with greater educational
      benefit than simulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual interactive presence (VIP) is a new technology that allows an
      individual to deliver real-time virtual assistance to another geographically
      remote individual via a standard Internet connection. The objectives of this
      pilot study were to evaluate the efficiency and performance of a VIP system
      implemented in an operating room setting, determine the potential utility of the 
      system for guidance of surgical procedures, and assess the safety of the system. 
      METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, fifteen patients
      underwent arthroscopic shoulder procedures. Two VIP stations were used, one in
      the operating room and the other in an adjoining dictation room. The attending
      surgeon proctored operating resident surgeons from the dictation room until his
      physical presence was required in the operating room. Following each procedure,
      the attending surgeon, resident surgeons, and three surgical staff members
      completed a Likert-scale questionnaire regarding the educational utility,
      efficiency of use, and safety of the system. The operative time was also compared
      with historical data. RESULTS: Both attending and resident surgeons assigned a
      favorable rating to the utility of the VIP to highlight anatomy and provide
      feedback to the resident (p &gt; 0.05 for the difference). Both groups agreed
      that the system was easy to use and that safety was not compromised (p &gt;
      0.05). The majority of resident and attending surgeon responses indicated no
      perceptible lag between motions (95% and 100%, respectively; p &gt; 0.99) and no 
      interference of the VIP system with the surgical procedure (85% and 100%,
      respectively; p = 0.24). The mean operative times with and without VIP use did
      not differ significantly for rotator cuff repair (p = 0.90) or for treatment of
      instability (p = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study revealed that the VIP
      technology was efficient, safe, and effective as a teaching tool. The attending
      and resident surgeons agreed that training was enhanced, and this occurred
      without increasing operative times. Furthermore, the attending surgeon believed
      that this technology improved teaching effectiveness. These results are
      promising, and further objective quantification is warranted.

TI  - Three-dimensional virtual reality simulation of periarticular tumors using
      Dextroscope reconstruction and simulated surgery: a preliminary 10 case study.
PG  - 132-8
AB  - Dextroscope three-dimensional (3D) imaging has been extensively applied for
      generation of virtual reality (VR) workspaces for in neurosurgery and
      laparoscopy, though few applications in orthopedic surgery have been reported.
      Patients undergoing surgery for periarticular tumors (n = 10) from Oct. 2008 to
      Jun. 2010 were enrolled and presurgically subjected to computed tomography (CT), 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and MRI angiography (MRI-A). Imaging data was
      transferred and integrated in Dextroscope, producing a VR simulation. Resultant
      presurgical 3D anatomical reconstructions and intraoperative anatomical
      characteristics (virtual vs. actual data) and surgical approach (virtual vs.
      actual situation) measurement and subjective appearance were compared. Anatomical
      characteristics in the area of interest and tumor diameters were consistent
      between virtual and actual data. However, the virtual surgical situations
      remained inconsistent with the actual intraoperative situation in many cases,
      leading to complications. The resolution of original CT, MRI, and MRI-A images
      directly correlated with the quality of 3D simulations, with soft tissues most
      poorly represented. Tumor tissue imaging quality in 3D varied extensively by
      tumor type. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomical structures of periarticular tumors can be
      reconstructed using the Dextroscope system with good accuracy in the case of
      simple fenestration, increasing individualization of treatment, surgical
      competence level, and potentially reducing intraoperative complications. However,
      further specialization of VR tools for use in orthopedic applications that
      involve specialized tools and procedures, such as drilling and implant placement,
      are urgently required.

TI  - Virtual reality spine surgery simulation: an empirical study of its usefulness.
PG  - 968-73
LID - 10.1179/1743132814Y.0000000388 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explores the usefulness of virtual simulation training for 
      learning to place pedicle screws in the lumbar spine. METHODS: Twenty-six senior 
      medical students anonymously participated and were randomized into two groups (A 
      = no simulation; B = simulation). Both groups were given 15 minutes to place two 
      pedicle screws in a sawbones model. Students in Group A underwent traditional
      visual/verbal instruction whereas students in Group B underwent training on
      pedicle screw placement in the ImmersiveTouch simulator. The students in both
      groups then placed two pedicle screws each in a lumbar sawbones models that
      underwent triplanar thin slice computerized tomography and subsequent analysis
      based on coronal entry point, axial and sagittal deviations, length error, and
      pedicle breach. The average number of errors per screw was calculated for each
      group. Semi-parametric regression analysis for clustered data was used with
      generalized estimating equations accommodating a negative binomial distribution
      to determine any statistical difference of significance. RESULTS: A total of 52
      pedicle screws were analyzed. The reduction in the average number of errors per
      screw after a single session of simulation training was 53.7% (P = 0.0067). The
      average number of errors per screw in the simulation group was 0.96 versus 2.08
      in the non-simulation group. The simulation group outperformed the non-simulation
      group in all variables measured. The three most benefited measured variables were
      length error (86.7%), coronal error (71.4%), and pedicle breach (66.7%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Computer-based simulation appears to be a valuable teaching tool for
      non-experts in a highly technical procedural task such as pedicle screw placement
      that involves sequential learning, depth perception, and understanding triplanar 
      anatomy.

TI  - Temporal bone dissection practice using a chicken egg.
PG  - 941-3
LID - 10.1097/MAO.0000000000000390 [doi]
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Temporal bone drilling practice constitutes an essential stage in
      training for the surgical approach to this complex anatomic structure. To
      facilitate adaptation and surgical skills in otologic surgery, we recall the easy
      cost-effective practice of drilling a chicken egg. BACKGROUND: The resident in
      training must master the use of the surgical microscope, the burr, and fine
      drilling instruments used in dissection. Animal models, plastic temporal bones,
      prototyped temporal bones, and virtual reality temporal bones have all been used.
      METHODS: This article describes a method of training residents' otologic skills
      by drilling a chicken egg. We used basic support materials found in a typical
      temporal bone dissection laboratory, with a surgical microscope, a desk, and a
      drilling system. Practice includes drilling and dissection of the eggshell,
      preserving the natural eggshell membrane. RESULTS: Learning temporal bone
      drilling on an egg, using basic materials, allows the surgeon to simulate surgery
      on a physical model using the same instrumentation that is used in surgery,
      obviating the need for laboratory conditions required for cadaveric dissection.
      CONCLUSION: Simulation is emerging as a mandatory component of surgical training.
      The egg is an excellent cost-effective model for drilling and dissection training
      and helps in improving surgical skills, enables learning of fine motor skills,
      and allows repeated practice. Although this method of training does help one
      control a drill and manual instrumentation, it does not help with temporal bone
      anatomy knowledge.

TI  - The GOSTT concept and hybrid mixed/virtual/augmented reality environment
      radioguided surgery.
PG  - 207-15
AB  - The popularity gained by the sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure in the last two 
      decades did increase the interest of the surgical disciplines for other
      applications of radioguided surgery. An example is the gamma-probe guided
      localization of occult or difficult to locate neoplastic lesions. Such guidance
      can be achieved by intralesional delivery (ultrasound, stereotaxis or CT) of a
      radiolabelled agent that remains accumulated at the site of the injection.
      Another possibility rested on the use of systemic administration of a
      tumour-seeking radiopharmaceutical with favourable tumour accumulation and
      retention. On the other hand, new intraoperative imaging devices for radioguided 
      surgery in complex anatomical areas became available. All this a few years ago
      led to the delineation of the concept Guided intraOperative Scintigraphic Tumour 
      Targeting (GOSTT) to include the whole spectrum of basic and advanced nuclear
      medicine procedures required for providing a roadmap that would optimise surgery.
      The introduction of allied signatures using, e.g. hybrid tracers for simultaneous
      detection of the radioactive and fluorescent signals did amply the GOSTT concept.
      It was now possible to combine perioperative nuclear medicine imaging with the
      superior resolution of additional optical guidance in the operating room. This
      hybrid approach is currently in progress and probably will become an important
      model to follow in the coming years. A cornerstone in the GOSTT concept is
      constituted by diagnostic imaging technologies like SPECT/CT. SPECT/CT was
      introduced halfway the past decade and was immediately incorporated into the SLN 
      procedure. Important reasons attributing to the success of SPECT/CT were its
      combination with lymphoscintigraphy, and the ability to display SLNs in an
      anatomical environment. This latter aspect has significantly been improved in the
      new generation of SPECT/CT cameras and provides the base for the novel mixed
      reality protocols of image-guided surgery. In these protocols the generated
      virtual SPECT/CT elements are visually superimposed in the body of the patient in
      the operating room to directly facilitate, by means of visualization on screen or
      using head-mounted devices, the localization of radioactive and/or fluorescent
      targets by minimal invasive approaches in areas of complex anatomy. All these
      technological advances will play an increasing role in the future extension and
      the clinical impact of the GOSTT concept.

      part of the resection of tumors in the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) of 20
      patients compared to the actual microanatomy of the vertebral arteries of 15
      cadaveric headsets. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted with 2 groups
      of data: a VR group composed of 20 clinical cases and a physical body group (PB
      group) composed of 15 cadaveric headsets. In the VR group, the dissection and
      measurements of the vertebral arteries were simulated on a Dextroscope. In the PB
      group, the vertebral arteries in the cadaver heads were examined under a
      microscope and anatomical measurements of VA and bony structures were performed. 
      The length and course of the vertebral arteries and its surrounding bony
      structures in each group were compared. RESULTS: The distances from the inferior 
      part of the transverse process foramen (TPF) of C1 to the inferior part of TPF of
      C2 were 17.68+/-2.86 mm and 18.4+/-1.82 mm in the PB and VR groups, respectively.
      The distances between the middle point of the posterior arch of the atlas and the
      medial intersection of VA on the groove were 17.35+/-2.23 mm in the PB group and 
      18.13+/-2.58 mm in the VR group. The distances between the middle line and the
      entrance of VA to the lower rim of TPF of Atlas were 28.64+/-2.67 mm in PB group 
      and 29.23+/-2.89 mm in VR group. The diameters of the vertebral artery (VA) at
      the end of the groove and foramen of C2 transverse process were 4.02+/-046 mm and
      4.25+/-0.51 mm, respectively, in the PB group and 3.54+/-0.44 mm and 4.47+/-0.62 
      mm, respectively, in VR group. The distances between the VA lumen center and
      midline of the foramen magnum at the level of dural penetration was 10.4+/-1.13
      mm in the PB group and 11.5+/-1.34 mm in the VR group (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: VR
      technology can accurately simulate the anatomical features of the suboccipital
      vertebral arteries and their bony structures, which facilitates the planning of
      individual surgeries in the CVJ.

AB  - Thermally injured patients experience tremendous pain from the moment of injury
      to months or years after their discharge from the hospital. Pain is therefore a
      critical component of proper management of burns. Although the importance of pain
      is well recognized, it is often undertreated. Acute uncontrolled pain has been
      shown to increase the incidence of mental health disorders and increase the
      incidence of suicide after discharge. Long-term poor pain control leads to an
      increase in the incidence of persistent pain. Most burn centers have used opioids
      as the mainstay analgesic, but recently, the significant side effects of opioids 
      have led to the implementation of new and combined therapeutics. Pharmacological 
      agents such as gabapentin, clonidine, dexmedetomidine, and ketamine have all been
      suggested as adjuncts to opioids in the treatment of burn pain.
      Nonpharmacological therapies such as hypnosis, virtual reality devices, and
      behavioral therapy are also essential adjuncts to current medications. This
      review aims at identifying the currently available pharmacological and
      nonpharmacological options for optimal pain management in the adult burn
      population.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the place of simulation in the training curriculum of French
      urologists-in-training. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was sent
      to all residents and fellows members of the AFUF between February and May, 2013. 
      Results are presented as the median (interquartile range). RESULTS: The answers
      of 125 urologists-in-training were computed (response rate 38%). They were
      residents in 90 cases (72%), and fellows in 35 cases (28%). Median age was 29
      (27-30), male proportion 77%. All French academic urology departments were
      represented. Ninety of them (72%) had access to a pelvi-trainer and 66 (53%) to
      animal or cadaveric models, although they never used them or less than once a
      month in 83 and 97% of cases, respectively. Seventy-two (58%) had used a
      virtual-reality based simulator at least once and 38 (30%) had regular access to 
      one, but without supervision in 64% of cases. Factors limiting simulation-based
      training were the lack of available simulators (70%), the lack of time (58%), the
      absence of incitement (34%) and supervision (20%). If these conditions were met, 
      86% of urologists-in-training would be ready to spend more than one hour a-week
      training on a simulator. CONCLUSION: This study revealed among the sample of
      respondents a limited use of simulation tools for skills aquisition. This was
      explained by a limited availability of these tools but also by an insufficient
      use of the tools when available.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, there has been a growth in studies supporting the
      hypothesis that video games have positive effects on basic laparoscopic skills.
      This review discusses all studies directly related to these effects. DATA
      SOURCES: A search in the PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed using
      synonymous terms for video games and laparoscopy. All available articles
      concerning video games and their effects on skills on any laparoscopic simulator 
      (box trainer, virtual reality, and animal models) were selected. CONCLUSIONS:
      Video game experience has been related to higher baseline laparoscopic skills in 
      different studies. There is currently, however, no standardized method to assess 
      video game experience, making it difficult to compare these studies. Several
      controlled experiments have, nevertheless, shown that video games cannot only be 
      used to improve laparoscopic basic skills in surgical novices, but are also used 
      as a temporary warming-up before laparoscopic surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive surgery represents one of the main evolutions of
      surgical techniques. However, minimally invasive surgery adds difficulty that can
      be reduced through computer technology. METHODS: From a patient's medical image
      [US, computed tomography (CT) or MRI], we have developed an Augmented Reality
      (AR) system that increases the surgeon's intraoperative vision by providing a
      virtual transparency of the patient. AR is based on two major processes: 3D
      modeling and visualization of anatomical or pathological structures appearing in 
      the medical image, and the registration of this visualization onto the real
      patient. We have thus developed a new online service, named Visible Patient,
      providing efficient 3D modeling of patients. We have then developed several 3D
      visualization and surgical planning software tools to combine direct volume
      rendering and surface rendering. Finally, we have developed two registration
      techniques, one interactive and one automatic providing intraoperative augmented 
      reality view. RESULTS: From January 2009 to June 2013, 769 clinical cases have
      been modeled by the Visible Patient service. Moreover, three clinical validations
      have been realized demonstrating the accuracy of 3D models and their great
      benefit, potentially increasing surgical eligibility in liver surgery (20% of
      cases). From these 3D models, more than 50 interactive AR-assisted surgical
      procedures have been realized illustrating the potential clinical benefit of such
      assistance to gain safety, but also current limits that automatic augmented
      reality will overcome. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual patient modeling should be mandatory 
      for certain interventions that have now to be defined, such as liver surgery.
      Augmented reality is clearly the next step of the new surgical instrumentation
      but remains currently limited due to the complexity of organ deformations during 
      surgery. Intraoperative medical imaging used in new generation of automated
      augmented reality should solve this issue thanks to the development of Hybrid OR.

PG  - 6707-16
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3276-13.2014 [doi]
AB  - It is widely accepted that action and perception in humans functionally interact 
      on multiple levels. Moreover, areas originally suggested to be predominantly
      motor-related, as the cerebellum, are also involved in action observation.
      However, as yet, few studies provided unequivocal evidence that the cerebellum is
      involved in the action perception coupling (APC), specifically in the integration
      of motor and multisensory information for perception. We addressed this question 
      studying patients with focal cerebellar lesions in a virtual-reality paradigm
      measuring the effect of action execution on action perception presenting
      self-generated movements as point lights. We measured the visual sensitivity to
      the point light stimuli based on signal detection theory. Compared with healthy
      controls cerebellar patients showed no beneficial influence of action execution
      on perception indicating deficits in APC. Applying lesion symptom mapping, we
      identified distinct areas in the dentate nucleus and the lateral cerebellum of
      both hemispheres that are causally involved in APC. Lesions of the right ventral 
      dentate, the ipsilateral motor representations (lobules V/VI), and most
      interestingly the contralateral posterior cerebellum (lobule VII) impede the
      benefits of motor execution on perception. We conclude that the cerebellum
      establishes time-dependent multisensory representations on different levels,
      relevant for motor control as well as supporting action perception. Ipsilateral
      cerebellar motor representations are thought to support the somatosensory state
      estimate of ongoing movements, whereas the ventral dentate and the contralateral 
      posterior cerebellum likely support sensorimotor integration in the
      cerebellar-parietal loops. Both the correct somatosensory as well as the
      multisensory state representations are vital for an intact APC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine novice and expert differences in visual control strategies 
      while performing a virtual reality transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)
      task and to determine if these differences could provide a novel method for
      assessing construct validity of the simulator. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of
      11 novices (no TURP experience) and 7 experts (>200 TURPs) completed a virtual
      reality prostate resection task on the TURPsim (Simbionix USA Corp, Cleveland,
      OH) while wearing an eye tracker (ASL, Bedford, MA). Performance parameters and
      the surgeon's visual control strategy were measured and compared between the 2
      groups. RESULTS: Experts resected a greater percentage of prostate than novices
      (p < 0.01) and had less active diathermy time without tissue contact (p < 0.01). 
      Experts adopted a target-locking visual strategy, employing fewer visual
      fixations (p < 0.05) with longer mean fixation duration (p < 0.005). With
      multiple learning trials, novices' performance improved and the adoption of a
      more expertlike gaze strategy was observed. CONCLUSION: Significant differences
      between experts and novices in both performance and visual control strategy were 
      observed. The study of visual control strategies may be a useful adjunct,
      alongside measurements of motor performance, providing a novel method of
      assessing the construct validity of surgical simulators.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) and physical model (PM) simulators differ in
      terms of whether the trainee is manipulating actual 3-dimensional objects (PM) or
      computer-generated 3-dimensional objects (VR). Much like video games (VG), VR
      simulators utilize computer-generated graphics. These differences may have
      profound effects on the utility of VR and PM training platforms. In this study,
      we aimed to determine whether a relationship exists between VR, PM, and VG
      platforms. METHODS: VR and PM simulators for laparoscopic camera navigation
      ([LCN], experiment 1) and flexible endoscopy ([FE] experiment 2) were used in
      this study. In experiment 1, 20 laparoscopic novices played VG and performed 0
      degrees and 30 degrees LCN exercises on VR and PM simulators. In experiment 2, 20
      FE novices played VG and performed colonoscopy exercises on VR and PM simulators.
      RESULTS: In both experiments, VG performance was correlated with VR performance
      but not with PM performance. Performance on VR simulators did not correlate with 
      performance on respective PM models. CONCLUSIONS: VR environments may be more
      like VG than previously thought.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine resident performance on the Mimic dV-Trainer (MdVT; Mimic 
      Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA) for correlation with resident trainee level
      (postgraduate year [PGY]), console experience (CE), and simulator exposure in
      their training program to assess for internal bias with the simulator. DESIGN:
      Residents from programs of the Southeastern Section of the American Urologic
      Association participated. Each resident was scored on 4 simulator tasks (peg
      board, camera targeting, energy dissection [ED], and needle targeting) with 3
      different outcomes (final score, economy of motion score, and time to complete
      exercise) measured for each task. These scores were evaluated for association
      with PGY, CE, and simulator exposure. SETTING: Robotic skills training
      laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 27 residents from 14 programs of the
      Southeastern Section of the American Urologic Association participated. RESULTS: 
      Time to complete the ED exercise was significantly shorter for residents who had 
      logged live robotic console compared with those who had not (p = 0.003). There
      were no other associations with live robotic console time that approached
      significance (all p >/= 0.21). The only measure that was significantly associated
      with PGY was time to complete ED exercise (p = 0.009). No associations with
      previous utilization of a robotic simulator in the resident's home training
      program were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The ED exercise on the MdVT 
      is most associated with CE and PGY compared with other exercises. Exposure of
      trainees to the MdVT in training programs does not appear to alter performance
      scores compared with trainees who do not have the simulator.

PG  - 190-7

AB  - BACKGROUND: Efficient acquisition of endoscopic technique is essential for
      high-level care in surgical practice. In contrast to similar substantial risk
      industries, there is no standard instrument capable of detecting the potential of
      surgical residency candidates to develop such skills. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We
      used the Simbionix "Lapmentor" Virtual reality simulator basic skills tasks 1, 5 
      and 6 to establish baseline performance of 17 subjects lacking surgical
      experience, then divided them into two groups. One group trained on the
      Lapmentor, a validated trainer. The second group trained on a video box trainer
      using 3 FLS tasks, which correlate with real OR performance. After completing the
      training program, each group was tested on its training modality and correlations
      were sought between performance in the screening tasks and final scores in both
      groups. RESULTS: Time in Lapmentor task 1 showed significant correlations with
      total FLS scores (R 0.807 P 0.015), in addition to other benchmark parameters.
      With the Lapmentor group, time on task 5 demonstrated correlation with itself on 
      the final scores (R 0.794 P 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Time in the Lapmentor task 1
      demonstrates correlations with FLS scores, which translate to better OR
      performance. The Lapmentor thus shows potential to be used as a screening test
      for surgical talent.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Simulation training for surgical residents can shorten learning
      curves, improve technical skills, and expedite competency. Several studies have
      shown that skills learned in the simulated environment are transferable to the
      operating room. Residency programs are trying to incorporate simulation into the 
      resident training curriculum to supplement the hands-on experience gained in the 
      operating room. Despite the availability and proven utility of surgical
      simulators and simulation laboratories, they are still widely underutilized by
      surgical trainees. Studies have shown that voluntary use leads to minimal
      participation in a training curriculum. Although there are several simulation
      tools, there is no clear evidence of the superiority of one tool over the other
      in skill acquisition. The purpose of this study was to explore resident
      perceptions, training experiences, and preferences regarding laparoscopic
      simulation training. Our goal was to profile resident participation in surgical
      skills simulation, recognize potential barriers to voluntary simulator use, and
      identify simulation tools and tasks preferred by residents. Furthermore, this
      study may help to inform whether mandatory/protected training time, as part of
      the residents' curriculum is essential to enhance participation in the simulation
      laboratory. METHODS: A cross-sectional study on general surgery residents
      (postgraduate years 1-5) at Yale University School of Medicine and the University
      of Toronto via an online questionnaire was conducted. Overall, 67 residents
      completed the survey. The institutional review board approved the methods of the 
      study. RESULTS: Overall, 95.5% of the participants believed that simulation
      training improved their laparoscopic skills. Most respondents (92.5%) perceived
      that skills learned during simulation training were transferrable to the
      operating room. Overall, 56.7% of participants agreed that proficiency in a
      simulation curriculum should be mandatory before operating room experience. The
      simulation laboratory was most commonly used during work hours; lack of free time
      during work hours was most commonly cited as a reason for underutilization.
      Factors influencing use of the simulation laboratory in order of importance were 
      the need for skill development, an interest in minimally invasive surgery,
      mandatory/protected time in a simulation environment as part of the residency
      program curriculum, a recommendation by an attending surgeon, and proximity of
      the simulation center. The most preferred simulation tool was the live animal
      model followed by cadaveric tissue. Virtual reality simulators were among the
      least-preferred (25%) simulation tools. Most residents (91.0%) felt that
      mandatory/protected time in a simulation environment should be introduced into
      resident training protocols. CONCLUSIONS: Mandatory and protected time in a
      simulation environment as part of the resident training curriculum may improve
      participation in simulation training. A comprehensive curriculum, which includes 
      the use of live animals, cadaveric tissue, and virtual reality simulators, may
      enhance the laparoscopic training experience and interest level of surgical
      trainees.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Traditional orthopaedic training has followed an apprenticeship
      model whereby trainees enhance their skills by operating under guidance. However 
      the introduction of limitations on training hours and shorter training programmes
      mean that alternative training strategies are required. AIMS: To perform a
      literature review on simulation training in arthroscopy and devise a framework
      that structures different simulation techniques that could be used in
      arthroscopic training. METHODS: A systematic search of Medline, Embase, Google
      Scholar and the Cochrane Databases were performed. Search terms included "virtual
      reality OR simulator OR simulation" and "arthroscopy OR arthroscopic". RESULTS:
      14 studies evaluating simulators in knee, shoulder and hip arthroplasty were
      included. The majority of the studies demonstrated construct and transference
      validity but only one showed concurrent validity. More studies are required to
      assess its potential as a training and assessment tool, skills transference
      between simulators and to determine the extent of skills decay from prolonged
      delays in training. We also devised a "ladder of arthroscopic simulation" that
      provides a competency-based framework to implement different simulation
      strategies. CONCLUSION: The incorporation of simulation into an orthopaedic
      curriculum will depend on a coordinated approach between many bodies. But the
      successful integration of simulators in other areas of surgery supports a
      possible role for simulation in advancing orthopaedic education.

TI  - Virtual-reality simulation to assess performance in hip fracture surgery.
PG  - 403-7
LID - 10.3109/17453674.2014.917502 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Internal fixation of hip fractures is a common and
      important procedure that orthopedic surgeons must master early in their career.
      Virtual-reality training could improve initial skills, and a simulation-based
      test would make it possible to ensure basic competency of junior surgeons before 
      they proceed to supervised practice on patients. The aim of this study was to
      develop a reliable and valid test with credible pass/fail standards. METHODS: 20 
      physicians (10 untrained novices and 10 experienced orthopedic surgeons) each
      performed 3 internal fixation procedures of an undisplaced femoral neck fracture:
      2 hook-pins, 2 screws, and a sliding hip screw. All procedures were preformed on 
      a trauma simulator. Performance scores for each procedure were obtained from the 
      predefined metrics of the simulator. The inter-case reliability of the simulator 
      metrics was explored by calculation of intra-class correlation coefficient.
      Validity was explored by comparison between novices' and experts' scores using
      independent-samples t-test. A pass/fail standard was set by the
      contrasting-groups method and the consequences were explored. RESULTS: The
      percentage of maximum combined score (PM score) showed an inter-case reliability 
      of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.65-0.93) between the 3 procedures. The mean PM score was 30%
      (CI: 7-53) for the novices and 76% (CI: 68-83) for the experienced surgeons. The 
      pass/fail standard was set at 58%, resulting in none of the novices passing the
      test and a single experienced surgeon failing the test. INTERPRETATION: The
      simulation-based test was reliable and valid in our setting, and the pass/fail
      standard could discriminate between novices and experienced surgeons.
      Potentially, training and testing of future junior surgeons on a virtual-reality 
      simulator could ensure basic competency before proceeding to supervised practice 
      on patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Virtual reality simulators are increasingly used in laparoscopy
      training. Such simulators allow objective assessment of performance. However,
      both low-level variables and overall scores generated by the simulator can be
      hard to interpret. We present a method to generate intermediate performance
      variables and show how the resulting variables can be used to investigate the
      development of laparoscopic skills. DESIGN: A beginner group (n = 16) and a group
      with intermediate laparoscopic experience (n = 9) participated in a 5-session,
      basic skills training course hosted by the Department of Technical Medicine at
      the University of Twente. Multiple simulator-generated variables were aggregated 
      into 4 performance variables: duration, left-hand motion, right-hand motion, and 
      damage. Differences in performance were analyzed in relation to proficiency
      values. RESULTS: Damage performance differentiated the most between groups and
      proficiency values; motion performance variables differentiated the least. The
      more experienced group outperformed the beginner group at damage by the end of
      the course. CONCLUSIONS: Differentiating between duration, left-hand motion,
      right-hand motion, and damage is a useful way to investigate laparoscopic
      performance development. Different performance variables follow different
      trajectories toward expertise. Valid and reliable clinical damage parameters are 
      needed to investigate the relation of real-world damage to simulator damage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality surgical simulators are becoming popular as a means
      of providing trainees with an opportunity to practice laparoscopic skills. The
      Lap-X (Epona Medical, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) is a novel VR simulator for
      training basic skills in laparoscopic surgery. The objective of this study was to
      validate the LAP-X laparoscopic virtual reality simulator by assessing the face
      and construct validity in order to determine whether the simulator is adequate
      for basic skills training. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The face and content validity
      were evaluated using a structured questionnaire. To assess the construct
      validity, the participants, nine expert surgeons (median age: 40 (32-45)) (>100
      laparoscopic procedures) and 11 novices performed three basic laparoscopic tasks 
      using the Lap-X. RESULTS: The participants reported a high level of content
      validity. No significant differences were found between the expert surgeons and
      the novices (Ps > 0.246). The performance of the expert surgeons on the three
      tasks was significantly better than that of the novices in all parameters (Ps <
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the face, content and construct
      validity of the Lap-X. The Lap-X holds real potential as a home and hospital
      training device.

      training standard.
PG  - 2856-62
LID - 10.1007/s00464-014-3538-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The FLS trainer lacks objective and automated assessments of
      laparoscopic performance and requires a large supply of relatively expensive
      consumables. Virtual reality simulation has a great potential as a training and
      assessment tool of laparoscopic skills and can overcome some limitations of the
      FLS trainer. This study was carried out to assess the value of our Virtual Basic 
      Laparoscopic Surgical Trainer (VBLaST((c))) in the peg transfer task compared to 
      the FLS trainer and its ability to differentiate performance between novice,
      intermediate, and expert groups. METHODS: Thirty subjects were divided into three
      groups: novices (PGY1-2, n = 10), intermediates (PGY3-4, n = 10), and experts
      (PGY5, surgical fellows and attendings, n = 10). All subjects performed ten
      trials of the peg transfer task on each simulator. Assessment of laparoscopic
      performance was based on FLS scoring while a questionnaire was used for
      subjective evaluation. RESULTS: The performance scores in the two simulators were
      correlated, though subjects performed significantly better in the FLS trainer.
      Experts performed better than novices only on the FLS trainer while no
      significant differences were observed between the other groups. Moreover, a
      significant learning effect was found on both trainers, with a greater
      improvement of performance on the VBLaST((c)). Finally, 82.6% of the subjects
      preferred the FLS over the VBLaST((c)) for surgical training which could be
      attributed to the novelty of the VR technology and existing deficiencies of the
      user interface for the VBLaST((c)). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the 
      VBLaST((c)) reproduced faithfully some aspects of the FLS peg transfer task (such
      as color, size, and shape of the peg board, etc.) while other aspects require
      additional development. Future improvement of the user interface and haptic
      feedback will enhance the value of the system as an alternative to the FLS as the
      standard training tool for laparoscopic surgery skills.

TI  - One or two trainees per workplace in a structured multimodality training
      curriculum for laparoscopic surgery? Study protocol for a randomized controlled
      trial - DRKS00004675.
PG  - 137
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-15-137 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopy training courses have been established in many centers
      worldwide to ensure adequate skill learning before performing operations on
      patients. Different training modalities and their combinations have been compared
      regarding training effects. Multimodality training combines different approaches 
      for optimal training outcome. However, no standards currently exist for the
      number of trainees assigned per workplace. METHODS: This is a monocentric, open, 
      three-arm randomized controlled trial. The participants are
      laparoscopically-naive medical students from Heidelberg University. After a
      standardized introduction to laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) with online
      learning modules, the participants perform a baseline test for basic skills and
      LC performance on a virtual reality (VR) trainer. A total of 100 students will be
      randomized into three study arms, in a 2:2:1 ratio. The intervention groups
      participate individually (Group 1) or in pairs (Group 2) in a standardized and
      structured multimodality training curriculum. Basic skills are trained on the box
      and VR trainers. Procedural skills and LC modules are trained on the VR trainer. 
      The control group (Group C) does not receive training between tests. A post-test 
      is performed to reassess basic skills and LC performance on the VR trainer. The
      performance of a cadaveric porcine LC is then measured as the primary outcome
      using standardized and validated ratings by blinded experts with the Objective
      Structured Assessment of Technical Skills. The Global Operative Assessment of
      Laparoscopic Surgical skills score and the time taken for completion are used as 
      secondary outcome measures as well as the improvement of skills and VR LC
      performance between baseline and post-test. Cognitive tests and questionnaires
      are used to identify individual factors that might exert influence on training
      outcome. DISCUSSION: This study aims to assess whether workplaces in laparoscopy 
      training courses for beginners should be used by one trainee or two trainees
      simultaneously, by measuring the impact on operative performance and learning
      curves. Possible factors of influence, such as the role of observing the training
      partner, exchange of thoughts, active reflection, model learning, motivation,
      pauses, and sympathy will be explored in the data analysis. This study will help 
      optimize the efficiency of laparoscopy training courses. TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - The role of simulation in developing surgical skills.
PG  - 155-60
LID - 10.1007/s12178-014-9209-z [doi]
AB  - Surgical training has followed the master-apprentice model for centuries but is
      currently undergoing a paradigm shift. The traditional model is inefficient with 
      no guarantee of case mix, quality, or quantity. There is a growing focus on
      competency-based medical education in response to restrictions on doctors'
      working hours and the traditional mantra of "see one, do one, teach one" is being
      increasingly questioned. The medical profession is subject to more scrutiny than 
      ever before and is facing mounting financial, clinical, and political pressures. 
      Simulation may be a means of addressing these challenges. It provides a way for
      trainees to practice technical tasks in a protected environment without putting
      patients at risk and helps to shorten the learning curve. The evidence for
      simulation-based training in orthopedic surgery using synthetic models, cadavers,
      and virtual reality simulators is constantly developing, though further work is
      needed to ensure the transfer of skills to the operating theatre.

TI  - A temporal bone surgery simulator with real-time feedback for surgical training.
PG  - 462-8
AB  - Timely feedback on surgical technique is an important aspect of surgical skill
      training in any learning environment, be it virtual or otherwise. Feedback on
      technique should be provided in real-time to allow trainees to recognize and
      amend their errors as they occur. Expert surgeons have typically carried out this
      task, but they have limited time available to spend with trainees. Virtual
      reality surgical simulators offer effective, repeatable training at relatively
      low cost, but their benefits may not be fully realized while they still require
      the presence of experts to provide feedback. We attempt to overcome this
      limitation by introducing a real-time feedback system for surgical technique
      within a temporal bone surgical simulator. Our evaluation study shows that this
      feedback system performs exceptionally well with respect to accuracy and
      effectiveness.

TI  - Towards open-source, low-cost haptics for surgery simulation.
PG  - 401-3
AB  - In minimally invasive surgery (MIS), virtual reality (VR) training systems have
      become a promising education tool. However, the adoption of these systems in
      research and clinical settings is still limited by the high costs of dedicated
      haptics hardware for MIS. In this paper, we present ongoing research towards an
      open-source, low-cost haptic interface for MIS simulation. We demonstrate the
      basic mechanical design of the device, the sensor setup as well as its software
      integration.

PG  - 86-8
AB  - Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is a minimally invasive
      procedure which utilizes the body's natural orifices to gain access to the
      peritoneal cavity. The VTEST is a virtual reality NOTES cholecystectomy simulator
      being built at the CeMSIM at RPI. We have developed a 2 DOF decoupled haptic
      device, which can provide translational and rotational haptic feedback to the
      user handling the flexible endoscope. Preliminary results indicate the device is 
      capable of providing realistic feedback to the user while operating the device.

TI  - Virtual reality for improving body image disorders and weight loss after gastric 
      band surgery: a case series.
PG  - 43-7
AB  - Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding (LAGB) is a common surgery method used to
      help obese patients to lose weight. However, even if LAGB is able to produce a
      durable and relevant weight loss, it is less effective in improving body image:
      as demonstrated by a recent study, obese patients with a body image disorder in
      the pre-operative stage continue to show this even 13 months after the operation.
      In this presentation we will discuss the possible role of virtual reality (VR) in
      addressing this problem within an integrated cognitive behavioral approach. To
      test this approach, a case series of three LAGB patient who experienced body
      dissatisfaction even after a &gt;30/40% excess body weight loss, is presented and
      discussed. At the end of the 6-week protocol the patients experienced a 15%-20%
      further reduction of their weight. This reduction was also matched by a general
      improvement of the psychological state. Both the weight loss and the level of
      well-being were further improved after a three-month follow-up.

AB  - We propose a principled approach to the design of a computer-based, virtual
      reality simulator specifically for electrosurgical training. The design builds on
      the Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy (FUSE) program's didactic curriculum and
      the results of a survey of domain experts on the roles of cognitive knowledge and
      hands-on training for a selection of electrosurgery tasks. The resulting design
      focuses narrowly on the tissue effects caused during electrosurgery and the
      identified physician-controllable factors causing those effects.

      through the vaginal port. The hardware interface is designed for accurate motion 
      tracking of the scope and laparoscopic instruments to reproduce the unique
      hand-eye coordination. The haptic-enabled multimodal interactive simulation
      includes exposing the Calot's triangle and detaching the gall bladder while
      performing electrosurgery. The developed VTEST<sup>TM</sup> was demonstrated and 
      validated at NOSCAR 2013.

TI  - Computer-based virtual reality colonoscopy simulation improves patient-based
      colonoscopy performance.
PG  - 203-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy simulators that enable one to perform computer-based
      virtual colonoscopy now exist. However, data regarding the effectiveness of this 
      virtual training are limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether virtual reality
      simulator training translates into improved patient-based colonoscopy
      performance. METHODS: The present study was a prospective controlled trial
      involving 18 residents between postgraduate years 2 and 4 with no previous
      colonoscopy experience. These residents were assigned to receive 16 h of virtual 
      reality simulator training or no training. Both groups were evaluated on their
      first five patient-based colonoscopies. The primary outcome was the number of
      proctor 'assists' required per colonoscopy. Secondary outcomes included insertion
      time, depth of insertion, cecal intubation rate, proctor- and nurse-rated
      competence, and patient-rated pain. RESULTS: The simulator group required
      significantly fewer proctor assists than the control group (1.94 versus 3.43; P
      </= 0.001), inserted the colonoscope further unassisted (43 cm versus 24 cm;
      P=0.003) and there was a trend to intubate the cecum more often (26% versus 10%; 
      P=0.06). The simulator group received higher ratings of competence from both the 
      proctors (2.28 versus 1.88 of 5; P=0.02) and the endoscopy nurses (2.56 versus
      2.05 of 5; P=0.001). There were no significant differences in proctor-, nurse- or
      patient-rated pain, or attention to discomfort. CONCLULSIONS: Computer-based
      colonoscopy simulation in the initial stages of training improved novice
      trainees' patient-based colonoscopy performance.

      environment.

LID - 10.1002/lary.24708 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: We compare the behavior of expert surgeons operating on
      the "gold standard" of simulation-the cadaveric temporal bone-against a
      high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) simulation. We aim to determine whether expert
      behavior changes within the virtual environment and to understand how the
      fidelity of simulation affects users' behavior. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Five
      expert otologists performed cortical mastoidectomy and cochleostomy on a human
      cadaveric temporal bone and a VR temporal bone simulator. Hand movement and video
      recordings were used to derive a range of measures, to facilitate an analysis of 
      surgical technique, and to compare expert behavior between the cadaveric and
      simulator environments. RESULTS: Drilling time was similar across the two
      environments. Some measures such as total time and burr change count differed
      predictably due to the ease of switching burrs within the simulator. Surgical
      strokes were generally longer in distance and duration in VR, but these measures 
      changed proportionally to cadaveric measures across the stages of the procedure. 
      Stroke shape metrics differed, which was attributed to the modeling of burr
      behavior within the simulator. This will be corrected in future versions.
      CONCLUSION: Slight differences in drill interaction between a virtual environment
      and the real world can have measurable effects on surgical technique,
      particularly in terms of stroke length, duration, and curvature. It is important 
      to understand these effects when designing and implementing surgical training
      programs based on VR simulation--and when improving the fidelity of VR simulators
      to facilitate use of a similar technique in both real and simulated situations.

TI  - Virtual reality training and assessment in laparoscopic rectum surgery.
PG  - 194-209
LID - 10.1002/rcs.1582 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual-reality (VR) based simulation techniques offer an efficient
      and low cost alternative to conventional surgery training. This article describes
      a VR training and assessment system in laparoscopic rectum surgery. METHODS: To
      give a realistic visual performance of interaction between membrane tissue and
      surgery tools, a generalized cylinder based collision detection and a multi-layer
      mass-spring model are presented. A dynamic assessment model is also designed for 
      hierarchy training evaluation. RESULTS: With this simulator, trainees can operate
      on the virtual rectum with both visual and haptic sensation feedback
      simultaneously. The system also offers surgeons instructions in real time when
      improper manipulation happens. The simulator has been tested and evaluated by ten
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This prototype system has been verified by colorectal
      surgeons through a pilot study. They believe the visual performance and the
      tactile feedback are realistic. It exhibits the potential to effectively improve 
      the surgical skills of trainee surgeons and significantly shorten their learning 
      curve.

TI  - Evaluation of skill level between trainees and community orthopaedic surgeons
      using a virtual reality arthroscopic knee simulator.
PG  - e57
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.M.00779 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several virtual reality simulators have been developed to assist
      orthopaedic surgeons in acquiring the skills necessary to perform arthroscopic
      surgery. The purpose of this study was to assess the construct validity of the
      ArthroSim virtual reality arthroscopy simulator by evaluating whether skills
      acquired through increased experience in the operating room lead to improved
      performance on the simulator. METHODS: Using the simulator, six postgraduate
      year-1 orthopaedic residents were compared with six postgraduate year-5 residents
      and with six community-based orthopaedic surgeons when performing diagnostic
      arthroscopy. The time to perform the procedure was recorded. To ensure that
      subjects did not sacrifice the quality of the procedure to complete the task in a
      shorter time, the simulator was programmed to provide a completeness score that
      indicated whether the surgeon accurately performed all of the steps of diagnostic
      arthroscopy in the correct sequence. RESULTS: The mean time to perform the
      procedure by each group was 610 seconds for community-based orthopaedic surgeons,
      745 seconds for postgraduate year-5 residents, and 1028 seconds for postgraduate 
      year-1 residents. Both the postgraduate year-5 residents and the community-based 
      orthopaedic surgeons performed the procedure in significantly less time (p =
      0.006) than the postgraduate year-1 residents. There was a trend toward
      significance (p = 0.055) in time to complete the procedure when the postgraduate 
      year-5 residents were compared with the community-based orthopaedic surgeons. The
      mean level of completeness as assigned by the simulator for each group was 85%
      for the community-based orthopaedic surgeons, 79% for the postgraduate year-5
      residents, and 71% for the postgraduate year-1 residents. As expected, these
      differences were not significant, indicating that the three groups had achieved
      an acceptable level of consistency in their performance of the procedure.
      CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of surgeon experience resulted in improved efficiency 
      when performing diagnostic knee arthroscopy on the simulator. Further validation 
      studies utilizing the simulator are currently under way and the additional
      simulated tasks of arthroscopic meniscectomy, meniscal repair, microfracture, and
      loose body removal are being developed.

AB  - Lower limb amputation substantially disrupts motor and proprioceptive function.
      People with lower limb amputation experience considerable impairments in walking 
      ability, including increased fall risk. Understanding the biomechanical aspects
      of the gait of these patients is crucial in improving their gait function and
      their quality of life. In the present study, 9 persons with unilateral
      transtibial amputation and 13 able-bodied controls walked on a large treadmill in
      a Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN). While walking, subjects
      were either not perturbed, or were perturbed either by continuous mediolateral
      platform movements or by continuous mediolateral movements of the visual scene.
      Means and standard deviations of both step lengths and step widths increased
      significantly during both perturbation conditions (all p<0.001) for both groups. 
      Measures of variability, local and orbital dynamic stability of trunk movements
      likewise exhibited large and highly significant increases during both
      perturbation conditions (all p<0.001) for both groups. Patients with amputation
      exhibited greater step width variability (p=0.01) and greater trunk movement
      variability (p=0.04) during platform perturbations, but did not exhibit greater
      local or orbital instability than healthy controls for either perturbation
      conditions. Our findings suggest that, in the absence of other co-morbidities,
      patients with unilateral transtibial amputation appear to retain sufficient
      sensory and motor function to maintain overall upper body stability during
      walking, even when substantially challenged. Additionally, these patients did not
      appear to rely more heavily on visual feedback to maintain trunk stability during
      these walking tasks.

TI  - Effects of sleep hours and fatigue on performance in laparoscopic surgery
      simulators.
PG  - 2564-8
LID - 10.1007/s00464-014-3503-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on a virtual reality simulator have demonstrated that
      sleep-deprived residents make more errors. Work-hour restrictions were
      implemented, among other reasons, to ensure enough sleep time for residents. The 
      objective of this study was to assess the effects of sleep time, perceived
      fatigue, and experience on surgical performance. We hypothesized that performance
      would decrease with less sleep and fatigue, and that experienced surgeons would
      perform better than less experienced surgeons despite sleep deprivation and
      fatigue. METHODS: Twenty-two surgical residents and attendings performed a peg
      transfer task on two simulators: the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Skills (FLS)
      trainer and the Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Surgical Trainer (VBLaST(c)), a
      virtual version of the FLS. Participants also completed questionnaires to assess 
      their fatigue level and recent sleep hours. Each subject performed ten trials on 
      each simulator in a counterbalanced order. Performance was measured using the FLS
      normalized scores and analyzed using a multiple regression model. RESULTS: The
      multiple regression analysis showed that sleep hours and perceived fatigue were
      not covariates. No correlation was found between experience level and sleep hours
      or fatigue. Sleep hours and fatigue did not appear to affect performance.
      Expertise level was the only significant determinant of performance in both FLS
      and VBLaST(c). CONCLUSIONS: Restricting resident work hours was expected to
      result in less fatigue and better clinical performance. In our study, peg
      transfer task performance was not affected by sleep hours. Experience level was a
      significant indicator of performance. Further examination of the complex
      relationship between sleep hour, fatigue, and clinical performance is needed to
      support the practice of work-hour restriction for surgical residents.

TI  - Can virtual nature improve patient experiences and memories of dental treatment? 
      A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 90
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-15-90 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental anxiety and anxiety-related avoidance of dental care create
      significant problems for patients and the dental profession. Distraction
      interventions are used in daily medical practice to help patients cope with
      unpleasant procedures. There is evidence that exposure to natural scenery is
      beneficial for patients and that the use of virtual reality (VR) distraction is
      more effective than other distraction interventions, such as watching television.
      The main aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether the use 
      of VR during dental treatment can improve the overall dental experience and
      recollections of treatment for patients, breaking the negative cycle of memories 
      of anxiety leading to further anxiety, and avoidance of future dental
      appointments. Additionally, the aim is to test whether VR benefits dental
      patients with all levels of dental anxiety or whether it could be especially
      beneficial for patients suffering from higher levels of dental anxiety. The third
      aim is to test whether the content of the VR distraction can make a difference
      for its effectiveness by comparing two types of virtual environments, a natural
      environment and an urban environment. METHODS/DESIGN: The effectiveness of VR
      distraction will be examined in patients 18 years or older who are scheduled to
      undergo dental treatment for fillings and/or extractions, with a maximum length
      of 30 minutes. Patients will be randomly allocated into one of three groups. The 
      first group will be exposed to a VR of a natural environment. The second group
      will be exposed to a VR of an urban environment. A third group consists of
      patients who receive standard care (control group). Primary outcomes relate to
      patients' memories of the dental treatment one week after treatment: (a)
      remembered pain, (b) intrusive thoughts and (c) vividness of memories. Other
      measures of interest are the dental experience, the treatment experience and the 
      VR experience. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN41442806.

TI  - Two-photon calcium imaging in mice navigating a virtual reality environment.
PG  - e50885
LID - 10.3791/50885 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, two-photon imaging has become an invaluable tool in
      neuroscience, as it allows for chronic measurement of the activity of genetically
      identified cells during behavior(1-6). Here we describe methods to perform
      two-photon imaging in mouse cortex while the animal navigates a virtual reality
      environment. We focus on the aspects of the experimental procedures that are key 
      to imaging in a behaving animal in a brightly lit virtual environment. The key
      problems that arise in this experimental setup that we here address are:
      minimizing brain motion related artifacts, minimizing light leak from the virtual
      reality projection system, and minimizing laser induced tissue damage. We also
      provide sample software to control the virtual reality environment and to do
      pupil tracking. With these procedures and resources it should be possible to
      convert a conventional two-photon microscope for use in behaving mice.

TI  - Short-duration virtual reality simulation training positively impacts performance
      during laparoscopic colectomy in animal model: results of a single-blinded
      randomized trial : VR warm-up for laparoscopic colectomy.
PG  - 2547-54
LID - 10.1007/s00464-014-3500-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated skills transfer after virtual
      reality (VR) simulation training in laparoscopic surgery. However, the impact of 
      VR simulation training on transfer of skills related to laparoscopic colectomy
      remains not investigated. The present study aimed at determining the impact of VR
      simulation warm-up on performance during laparoscopic colectomy in the porcine
      model. METHODS: Fourteen residents naive to laparoscopic colectomy as surgeons
      were randomly assigned in block to two groups. Seven trainees completed a 2-h VR 
      simulator training in the laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy module (study group).
      The remaining seven surgeons (control group) underwent no intervention. On the
      same day, all participants performed a sigmoid colectomy with anastomosis on a
      pig. All operations were video recorded. Two board-certified expert colorectal
      surgeons independently assessed performance during the colectomy on the swine.
      Examiners were blinded to group assignment. The two examiners used a previously
      validated clinical instrument specific to laparoscopic colectomy. The primary
      outcome was the generic and specific skills score values. RESULTS: Surgeons
      undergoing short-duration training on the VR simulator performed significantly
      better during laparoscopic colectomy on the pig regarding general and specific
      technical skills evaluation. The average score of generic skills was 17.2
      (16.5-18) for the control group and 20.1 (16.5-22) for the study group (p =
      0.002). The specific skills average score for the control group was 20.2
      (19-21.5) and 24.2 (21-27.5) for the study group (p = 0.001). There was
      acceptable concordance (Kendall's W) regarding the video assessment of generic (W
      = 0.78) and specific skills (W = 0.84) between the two examiners. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      single short-duration VR simulator practice positively impacted surgeons' generic
      and specific skills performance required to accomplish laparoscopic colectomy in 
      the swine model.

TI  - A comparison of NOTES transvaginal and laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures
      based upon task analysis.
PG  - 2443-51
LID - 10.1007/s00464-014-3495-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A virtual reality-based simulator for natural orifice translumenal
      endoscopic surgery (NOTES) procedures may be used for training and discovery of
      new tools and procedures. Our previous study (Sankaranarayanan et al. in Surg
      Endosc 27:1607-1616, 2013) shows that developing such a simulator for the
      transvaginal cholecystectomy procedure using a rigid endoscope will have the most
      impact on the field. However, prior to developing such a simulator, a thorough
      task analysis is necessary to determine the most important phases, tasks, and
      subtasks of this procedure. METHODS: 19 rigid endoscope transvaginal hybrid NOTES
      cholecystectomy procedures and 11 traditional laparoscopic procedures have been
      recorded and de-identified prior to analysis. Hierarchical task analysis was
      conducted for the rigid endoscope transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy. A time
      series analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance of the transvaginal
      NOTES and laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures. Finally, a comparison of
      electrosurgery-based errors was performed by two independent qualified personnel.
      RESULTS: The most time-consuming tasks for both laparoscopic and NOTES
      cholecystectomy are removing areolar and connective tissue surrounding the
      gallbladder, exposing Calot's triangle, and dissecting the gallbladder off the
      liver bed with electrosurgery. There is a positive correlation of performance
      time between the removal of areolar and connective tissue and electrosurgery
      dissection tasks in NOTES (r = 0.415) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (r =
      0.684) with p < 0.10. During the electrosurgery task, the NOTES procedures had
      fewer errors related to lack of progress in gallbladder removal. Contrarily,
      laparoscopic procedures had fewer errors due to the instrument being out of the
      camera view. CONCLUSION: A thorough task analysis and video-based quantification 
      of NOTES cholecystectomy has identified the most time-consuming tasks. A
      comparison of the surgical errors during electrosurgery gallbladder dissection
      establishes that the NOTES procedure, while still new, is not inferior to the
      established laparoscopic procedure.

TI  - Robotic duodenopancreatectomy assisted with augmented reality and real-time
      fluorescence guidance.
PG  - 2493-8
LID - 10.1007/s00464-014-3465-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The minimally invasive surgeon cannot use 'sense of touch' to
      orientate surgical resection, identifying important structures (vessels, tumors, 
      etc.) by manual palpation. Robotic research has provided technology to facilitate
      laparoscopic surgery; however, robotics has yet to solve the lack of tactile
      feedback inherent to keyhole surgery. Misinterpretation of the vascular supply
      and tumor location may increase the risk of intraoperative bleeding and worsen
      dissection with positive resection margins. METHODS: Augmented reality (AR)
      consists of the fusion of synthetic computer-generated images (three-dimensional 
      virtual model) obtained from medical imaging preoperative work-up and real-time
      patient images with the aim of visualizing unapparent anatomical details.
      RESULTS: In this article, we review the most common modalities used to achieve
      surgical navigation through AR, along with a report of a case of robotic
      duodenopancreatectomy using AR guidance complemented with the use of fluorescence
      guidance. CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of this complex and high-technology case 
      of robotic duodenopancreatectomy, and the overview of current technology that has
      made it possible to use AR in the operating room, highlights the needs for
      further evolution and the windows of opportunity to create a new paradigm in
      surgical practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: With the increase in robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery there is a 
      concomitant rising demand for training methods. The objective was to establish
      face and construct validity of a novel virtual reality simulator (dV-Trainer,
      Mimic Technologies, Seattle, WA) for the use in training of robot-assisted
      surgery. METHODS: A comparative cohort study was performed. Participants (n = 42)
      were divided into three groups according to their robotic experience. To
      determine construct validity, participants performed three different exercises
      twice. Performance parameters were measured. To determine face validity,
      participants filled in a questionnaire after completion of the exercises.
      RESULTS: Experts outperformed novices in most of the measured parameters. The
      most discriminative parameters were "time to complete" and "economy of motion" (P
      < 0.001). The training capacity of the simulator was rated 4.6 +/- 0.5 SD on a
      5-point Likert scale. The realism of the simulator in general, visual graphics,
      movements of instruments, interaction with objects, and the depth perception were
      all rated as being realistic. The simulator is considered to be a very useful
      training tool for residents and medical specialist starting with robotic surgery.
      CONCLUSIONS: Face and construct validity for the dV-Trainer could be established.
      The virtual reality simulator is a useful tool for training robotic surgery.

TI  - Augmented reality in the surgery of cerebral aneurysms: a technical report.
PG  - 252-60; discussion 260-1
LID - 10.1227/NEU.0000000000000328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Augmented reality is the overlay of computer-generated images on
      real-world structures. It has previously been used for image guidance during
      surgical procedures, but it has never been used in the surgery of cerebral
      aneurysms. OBJECTIVE: To report our experience of cerebral aneurysm surgery aided
      by augmented reality. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with 39 unruptured aneurysms
      were operated on in a prospective manner with augmented reality. Preoperative
      3-dimensional image data sets (angio-magnetic resonance imaging, angio-computed
      tomography, and 3-dimensional digital subtraction angiography) were used to
      create virtual segmentations of patients' vessels, aneurysms, aneurysm necks,
      skulls, and heads. These images were injected intraoperatively into the eyepiece 
      of the operating microscope. An example case of an unruptured posterior
      communicating artery aneurysm clipping is illustrated in a video. RESULTS: The
      described operating procedure allowed continuous monitoring of the accuracy of
      patient registration with neuronavigation data and assisted in the performance of
      tailored surgical approaches and optimal clipping with minimized exposition.
      CONCLUSION: Augmented reality may add to the performance of a minimally invasive 
      approach, although further studies need to be performed to evaluate whether
      certain groups of aneurysms are more likely to benefit from it. Further
      technological development is required to improve its user friendliness.

TI  - Effectiveness, usability, and acceptability of haptic-enabled virtual reality and
      mannequin modality simulators for surgical cricothyroidotomy.
PG  - 260-4
LID - 10.7205/MILMED-D-13-00365 [doi]
AB  - This research assesses the effectiveness, usability, and acceptability of
      mannequin and haptic-enabled virtual reality (VR) modality simulators by Army
      medics in a surgical cricothyroidotomy procedure. Research methods investigate
      through experimentation surgical task performance, technology acceptance, user
      recommendation, comparative analysis, and select cognitive task load results.
      Results indicate that the HapMed mannequin and CricSim VR simulators proved
      effective by meeting training task performance evaluation requirements. Both
      systems meet 95% user technology acceptance and 85% user recommendation levels.
      In conclusion, at those levels, either system may complement, reduce, or replace 
      the use of some alternative training methods such as animals or cadavers. To
      raise recommendation rates, future research needs to reduce barriers to blending 
      visualization with mannequin modalities and make further refinements within the
      modalities. One research pathway identified blends a mannequin with stereoscopic 
      visualization and motion parallax, providing correlated, partially transparent
      visual layers of anatomy and of various medical procedures in virtual overlay
      with the mannequin. Future research also needs to clarify acceptable degrees of
      freedom levels by task for haptics VR in light of real-world degrees of freedom
      requirements. Finally, artificial skin may need research to achieve better
      replication of human skin on mannequins.

TI  - Simulation-based training for prostate surgery.
PG  - 665-74
LID - 10.1111/bju.12721 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify and review the currently available simulators for
      prostate surgery and to explore the evidence supporting their validity for
      training purposes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the literature between 1999
      and 2014 was performed. The search terms included a combination of urology,
      prostate surgery, robotic prostatectomy, laparoscopic prostatectomy,
      transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), simulation, virtual reality,
      animal model, human cadavers, training, assessment, technical skills, validation 
      and learning curves. Furthermore, relevant abstracts from the American Urological
      Association, European Association of Urology, British Association of Urological
      Surgeons and World Congress of Endourology meetings, between 1999 and 2013, were 
      included. Only studies related to prostate surgery simulators were included;
      studies regarding other urological simulators were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 
      22 studies that carried out a validation study were identified. Five validated
      models and/or simulators were identified for TURP, one for photoselective
      vaporisation of the prostate, two for holmium enucleation of the prostate, three 
      for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and four for robot-assisted surgery.
      Of the TURP simulators, all five have demonstrated content validity, three face
      validity and four construct validity. The GreenLight laser simulator has
      demonstrated face, content and construct validities. The Kansai HoLEP Simulator
      has demonstrated face and content validity whilst the UroSim HoLEP Simulator has 
      demonstrated face, content and construct validity. All three animal models for
      LRP have been shown to have construct validity whilst the chicken skin model was 
      also content valid. Only two robotic simulators were identified with relevance to
      robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, both of which demonstrated construct
      validity. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of different simulators are available for
      prostate surgery, including synthetic bench models, virtual-reality platforms,
      animal models, human cadavers, distributed simulation and advanced training
      programmes and modules. The currently validated simulators can be used by
      healthcare organisations to provide supplementary training sessions for trainee
      surgeons. Further research should be conducted to validate simulated
      environments, to determine which simulators have greater efficacy than others and
      to assess the cost-effectiveness of the simulators and the transferability of
      skills learnt. With surgeons investigating new possibilities for easily
      reproducible and valid methods of training, simulation offers great scope for
      implementation alongside traditional methods of training.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Incisional hernia (IH) can be attributed to multiple factors. The
      presence of a parastomal hernia has shown to be a risk factor for IH after
      midline laparotomy. Our hypothesis is that this increased risk of IH may be
      caused by changes in biomechanical forces, such as midline shift to the
      contralateral side of the colostomy owing to decreased restraining forces at the 
      site of the colostomy, and left abdominal rectus muscle (ARM) atrophy owing to
      intercostal nerve damage. METHODS: Patients were selected if they underwent
      end-colostomy via open operation between 2004 and 2011. Patients were eligible if
      computed tomography (CT) had been performed postoperatively. If available,
      preoperative CTs were collected for case-control analyses. Midline shift was
      measured using V-scope application in the I-space, a CAVE-like virtual reality
      system. For the ARM atrophy hypothesis, measurements of ARM were performed at the
      level of colostomy, and 3 and 8 cm cranial and caudal of the colostomy. RESULTS: 
      Postoperative CT were available for 77 patients; of these patients, 30 also had a
      preoperative CT. Median follow-up was 19 months. A mean shift to the right side
      was identified after preoperative and postoperative comparison; from -1.3 +/- 4.6
      to 2.1 +/- 9.3 (P = .043). Furthermore, during rectus muscle measurements, a
      thinner left ARM was observed below the level of colostomy. DISCUSSION: Creation 
      of a colostomy alters the abdominal wall. Atrophy of the left ARM was seen caudal
      to the level of the colostomy, and a midline shift to the right side was evident 
      on CT. These changes may explain the increased rate of IH after colostomy
      creation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a virtual reality simulator (LapSim) and
      traditional box trainer are effective tools for the acquisition of basic
      laparoscopic skills, and whether the LapSim is superior to the box trainer in
      surgical education. METHODS: In a study at Ege University School of Medicine,
      Izmir, Turkey, between September 2008 and March 2013, 40 first- and second-year
      residents were randomized to train via the LapSim or box trainer for 4 weeks, and
      20 senior residents were allocated to a control group. All 3 groups performed
      laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation. Video records of each operation were
      assessed via the general rating scale of the Objective Structured Assessment of
      Laparoscopic Salpingectomy and by operation time in seconds. RESULTS: Compared
      with the control group, the LapSim and box trainer groups performed significantly
      better in total score (P<0.01 and P<0.01, respectively) and time (P=0.03 and
      P=0.01, respectively). There were no differences between the LapSim and box
      trainer groups. CONCLUSION: Novice residents who trained on a LapSim or box
      trainer performed better live laparoscopies than residents who trained via
      standard clinical surgical education. Training with a virtual reality simulator
      or box trainer should be considered before actual laparoscopic procedures are
      carried out.

TI  - Training in robotics: The learning curve and contemporary concepts in training.
PG  - 58-61
LID - 10.1016/j.aju.2013.10.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the learning curve of robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery
      for prostatectomy (RALP) and upper tract procedures, and show the differences
      between the classical approach to training and the new concept of parallel
      learning. METHODS: This mini-review is based on the results of a Medline search
      using the keywords 'da Vinci', 'robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery', 'training',
      'teaching' and 'learning curve'. RESULTS: For RALP and robot-assisted upper tract
      surgery, a learning curve of 8-150 procedures is quoted, with most articles
      proposing that 30-40 cases are needed to carry out the procedure safely. There is
      no consensus about which endpoints should be measured. In the traditional
      proctored training model, the surgeon learns the procedure linearly, following
      the sequential order of the surgical steps. A more recent approach is to specify 
      the relative difficulty of each step and to train the surgeon simultaneously in
      several steps of equal difficulty. The entire procedure is only performed after
      all the steps are mastered in a timely manner. Recently, a 'warm-up' before
      robotic surgery has been shown to be beneficial for successful surgery in the
      operating room. CONCLUSION: There is no clear definition of the duration of the
      effective learning curve for RALP and robotic upper tract surgery. The concept of
      stepwise, parallel learning has the potential to accelerate the learning process 
      and to make sure that initial cases are not too long. It can also be assumed that
      a preoperative 'warm up' could help significantly to improve the progress of the 
      trainee.

      one of the most challenging endourological procedures. In this review we examine 
      the problems arising when training residents in PCNL, and how to facilitate this 
      process. METHODS: The recommendations are derived from discussions and consensus 
      during the First European Urolithiasis Society (EULIS) meeting held in London in 
      September 2011. In addition, we searched Medline for articles identified using
      the keywords 'training', 'percutaneous surgery', 'renal calculi', 'PCNL',
      'virtual reality' and 'simulators'. We also assessed the effect of modern
      technology, including the availability of virtual reality models vs. operating
      room training, and how international organisations like EULIS and European
      Urological Association can help. RESULTS: The difficulty of training residents in
      PCNL is partly due to the complexity of obtaining a safe access to the kidney for
      lithotripsy. The most common way of obtaining access is guided by imaging only,
      and usually only fluoroscopic imaging is available. This has the potential for
      injuring structures from the skin to the renal capsule. Minor vascular injuries
      are relatively common, although most are self-limiting. Visceral injuries that
      are particularly important are pleural and less commonly colonic injuries, but
      they are more complex and often require additional procedures. CONCLUSIONS:
      Teaching the skills is more challenging than performing PCNL. In most urological 
      training programmes it is difficult to incorporate teaching and training skills
      when performing PCNL. To train an academic stone doctor, proficiency in the safe 
      conduct of PCNL is mandatory.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide an insight into the current status of semi-rigid and
      flexible ureteroscopy, following new curricula for training methods, including
      training with models, virtual reality and active mentoring. METHODS: We
      systematically reviewed previous reports, including articles in English
      identified using the following strategy: ('ureteroscopy'[Mesh]) or
      ('urolithiasis'[Mesh]) AND ('education'[Mesh]), or ('teaching'[Mesh]). Abstracts 
      submitted at congresses were not included. Relevant articles that were identified
      as references in the retrieved articles were also included. RESULTS: The terms
      ('urolithiasis'[Mesh] AND 'education'[Mesh]) retrieved 106 articles, of which
      five were included. The terms ('urolithiasis'[Mesh] AND 'teaching'[Mesh])
      retrieved six articles, of which three were included. The terms
      ('ureteroscopy'[Mesh] AND 'education'[Mesh]) retrieved 29 articles, of which 21
      were included. The terms ('ureteroscopy'[Mesh] AND 'teaching'[Mesh]) retrieved
      eight articles, of which seven were included. Remaining articles were found in
      the reference section of retrieved articles. Finally, 43 articles were included. 
      Four randomised controlled trials with level 1b evidence were included. Currently
      there is no standard teaching method for ureteroscopy and the number of cases to 
      reach competence has not yet been defined. However, simulation-based training has
      been shown to be effective, cost-effective, and to increase patient safety.
      CONCLUSIONS: Simulators lead to a more rapid acquisition of skills in
      ureteroscopy than do conventional training methods, and improve the performance
      of future surgeons. Flexible ureteroscopy simulators are a promising tool for
      training, and have the advantage of minimising the need for learning the
      procedures on patients. A didactic and clinical curriculum, including surgical
      videotape reviews as well as operative mentoring, enables a rapid progression in 
      already experienced endourologists. However, there are few reports specifically
      addressing the skills necessary for training.

      virtual reality and morphometric study.
PG  - 703792
LID - 10.1155/2014/703792 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the present contribution is to perform a detailed
      anatomic and virtual reality three-dimensional stereoscopic study in order to
      test the effectiveness of the extended endoscopic endonasal approaches for
      selected anterior and posterior circulation aneurysms. METHODS: The study was
      divided in two main steps: (1) simulation step, using a dedicated Virtual Reality
      System (Dextroscope, Volume Interactions); (2) dissection step, in which the
      feasibility to reach specific vascular territory via the nose was verified in the
      anatomical laboratory. RESULTS: Good visualization and proximal and distal
      vascular control of the main midline anterior and posterior circulation territory
      were achieved during the simulation step as well as in the dissection step
      (anterior communicating complex, internal carotid, ophthalmic, superior
      hypophyseal, posterior cerebral and posterior communicating, basilar, superior
      cerebellar, anterior inferior cerebellar, vertebral, and posterior inferior
      cerebellar arteries). CONCLUSION: The present contribution is intended as
      strictly anatomic study in which we highlighted some specific anterior and
      posterior circulation aneurysms that can be reached via the nose. For clinical
      applications of these approaches, some relevant complications, mainly related to 
      the endonasal route, such as proximal and distal vascular control, major arterial
      bleeding, postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak, and olfactory disturbances must
      be considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whilst surgery will face an imminent workforce shortage, an
      increasing majority of students decide against a surgical career. This study
      evaluated the current career expectations of medical students and tested a
      hands-on virtual reality (VR) intervention as a tool to increase their interest
      in surgery. METHODS: Randomly selected medical students of the University of
      Basel received a short questionnaire to rank their interest in five different
      postgraduate working environments prior to a lecture. After the lecture they
      participated in a hands-on VR demonstration. Thereafter an online questionnaire
      regarding workplace expectations, surgery and VR was sent to the students.
      RESULTS: The online questionnaire response rate was 87% (225/258). Before using
      the VR intervention, a nonsurgical career was preferred by the majority of
      students, followed by a surgical career, cross-disciplinary specialties, research
      and, finally, nonclinical work. Surgery (n = 99, 44%) and emergency medicine (n =
      111, 49%) were rated as incompatible with a good work-life balance. Further
      drawbacks to surgery were apprehension of competitive mentality, unclear career
      perspectives and longer working hours. The VR intervention had limited impact on 
      re-ranking the five working sectors and slightly increased the students' interest
      in surgery. CONCLUSION: Students' work environment expectations, their declining 
      interest in a surgical career and the increasing need for surgeons represent
      challenges for surgical societies to address, in order to improve the
      attractiveness of surgery amongst students. VR sessions may be integrated as part
      of the actions required to improve students' interest in a surgical career and
      should be further evaluated within controlled study designs.

TI  - Effect of tibial drill-guide angle on the mechanical environment at bone tunnel
      aperture after anatomic single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PG  - 973-81
LID - 10.1007/s00264-014-2290-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The tibial drill-guide angle in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
      reconstruction influences the tunnel placement and graft-tunnel force, and is
      potentially associated with post-operative tunnel widening. This study aimed to
      examine the effect of the drill-guide angle on the stress redistribution at the
      tibial tunnel aperture after anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction. METHODS: 
      A validated finite element model of human knee joint was used. The tibial tunnel 
      with drill-guide angle ranging from 30 degrees to 75 degrees was investigated.
      The post-operative stress redistribution in tibia under the compressive, valgus, 
      rotational and complex loadings was analysed. RESULTS: Compressive loading played
      a leading role on the stress redistribution at intra-articular tibial tunnel
      aperture. After ACL reconstruction, stress concentration occurred in the anterior
      and posterior regions of tunnel aperture while stress reduction occurred in the
      lateral and posteromedial regions under the compressive loading. Stress
      redistribution was partially alleviated by using the drill-guide angle ranging
      from 55 degrees to 65 degrees . CONCLUSIONS: The present study quantified the
      effect of bone tunnel drill-guide angle on the post-operative stress
      redistribution. This phenomenon potentially contributed to tunnel widening. A
      tunnel drill-guide angle ranging from 55 degrees to 65 degrees was proposed based
      on the biomechanical rationale. It could serve as a helpful surgical guide for
      ACL reconstruction.

TI  - A new "virtual" patient pathway for the management of radial head and neck
      fractures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimally displaced radial head and neck fractures are common and the
      outcome with conservative treatment is generally excellent. A new protocol was
      introduced to manage patients with these suspected fractures at a major urban
      hospital. Simple, undisplaced fractures without other associated injuries or
      instability were discharged with structured advice but no further face-to-face
      review. Patients with more complex injuries were reviewed at a "virtual clinic." 
      The aim of this study was to examine the outcome of this process in terms of
      patient flow, satisfaction, reattendance, and reintervention. METHODS: The 202
      eligible patients, who presented during a 1-year period from October 2011 to
      October 2012, were identified retrospectively from a prospectively collected
      administrative database. Mason type III and IV fractures were excluded. A
      questionnaire was administered by mail or phone call to assess satisfaction with 
      the process, information received, and function. RESULTS: Twenty (10%) patients
      required face-to-face review in a clinic, whereas 182 (90%) were managed with
      direct discharge; 155 patients responded to the survey (77%). The overall
      satisfaction rate was 96% in the suspected fracture group and 87% in the definite
      fracture group (P = .08). Satisfaction with the information provided was 95%. Two
      (1%) required late surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: In this study, patients
      with suspected Mason I or II fractures were managed with limited face-to-face
      follow-up with high satisfaction rates. The reintervention rate was extremely
      low. This process has significant benefits to patients, who have fewer hospital
      visits, and to orthopaedic departments, which have more time to devote to complex
      cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The implementation of duty-hour restrictions and a heightened
      awareness of patient safety has changed resident education and training. A new
      focus has been placed on high-yield training programs and simulation training has
      naturally grown to fill this need. METHODS: This article discusses the
      development of a training framework, knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and the
      design of a surgical simulation curriculum. Five residents were recruited for a
      pilot study of the curriculum. RESULTS: A successful framework for curriculum
      development was implemented using laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the example.
      The curriculum consisted of classroom and virtual reality simulation training and
      was completed in 3.1 to 4.8 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The current curricula that have
      been developed for surgical education cover the breadth of a surgical residency
      well. This curriculum went beyond these curricula and developed a structured
      framework for surgical training, a method that can be applied to any procedure.

TI  - Evaluation of a virtual-reality-based simulator using passive haptic feedback for
      knee arthroscopy.
PG  - 1077-85
LID - 10.1007/s00167-014-2888-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this work is to determine face validity and construct
      validity of a new virtual-reality-based simulator for diagnostic and therapeutic 
      knee arthroscopy. METHODS: The study tests a novel arthroscopic simulator based
      on passive haptics. Sixty-eight participants were grouped into novices,
      intermediates, and experts. All participants completed two exercises. In order to
      establish face validity, all participants filled out a questionnaire concerning
      different aspects of simulator realism, training capacity, and different
      statements using a seven-point Likert scale (range 1-7). Construct validity was
      tested by comparing various simulator metric values between novices and experts. 
      RESULTS: Face validity could be established: overall realism was rated with a
      mean value of 5.5 points. Global training capacity scored a mean value of 5.9.
      Participants considered the simulator as useful for procedural training of
      diagnostic and therapeutic arthroscopy. In the foreign body removal exercise,
      experts were overall significantly faster in the whole procedure (6 min 24 s vs. 
      8 min 24 s, p < 0.001), took less time to complete the diagnostic tour (2 min 49 
      s vs. 3 min 32 s, p = 0.027), and had a shorter camera path length (186 vs. 246
      cm, p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: The simulator achieved high scores in terms of
      realism. It was regarded as a useful training tool, which is also capable of
      differentiating between varying levels of arthroscopic experience. Nevertheless, 
      further improvements of the simulator especially in the field of therapeutic
      arthroscopy are desirable. In general, the findings support that
      virtual-reality-based simulation using passive haptics has the potential to
      complement conventional training of knee arthroscopy skills. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of use, perceived
      effectiveness, and preference for arthroscopic surgical skill training resources.
      An electronic survey was sent to orthopedics residents, residency program
      directors, and orthopedic sports medicine attending physicians in the United
      States. The frequency and perceived effectiveness of 10 types of adjunctive
      arthroscopic skills training was assessed. Residents and faculty members were
      asked to rate their confidence in resident ability to perform common arthroscopic
      procedures. Surveys were completed by 40 of 152 (26.3%) orthopedic residency
      program directors, 70 of 426 (16.4%) sports medicine faculty, and 235 of 3,170
      (7.4%) orthopedic residents. The use of adjunctive methods of training varied
      from only 9.8% of programs with virtual reality training to 80.5% of programs
      that used reading of published materials to develop arthroscopic skill. Practice 
      on cadaveric specimens was viewed as the most effective and preferred adjunctive 
      method of training. Residents trained on cadaveric specimens reported increased
      confidence in their ability to perform arthroscopic procedures. The resources for
      developing arthroscopic surgical skill vary considerably across orthopedic
      residency programs in the United States. Adjunctive training methods were
      perceived to be effective at supplementing traditional training in the operating 
      room.

TI  - Constructive real time feedback for a temporal bone simulator.
PG  - 315-22
AB  - As demands on surgical training efficiency increase, there is a stronger need for
      computer assisted surgical training systems. The ability to provide automated
      performance feedback and assessment is a critical aspect of such systems. The
      development of feedback and assessment models will allow the use of surgical
      simulators as self-guided training systems that act like expert trainers and
      guide trainees towards improved performance. This paper presents an approach
      based on Random Forest models to analyse data recorded during surgery using a
      virtual reality temporal bone simulator and generate meaningful automated
      real-time performance feedback. The training dataset consisted of 27 temporal
      bone simulation runs composed of 16 expert runs provided by 7 different experts
      and 11 trainee runs provided by 6 trainees. We demonstrate how Random Forest
      models can be used to predict surgical expertise and deliver feedback that
      improves trainees' surgical technique. We illustrate the potential of the
      approach through a feasibility study.

TI  - Individualized deliberate practice on a virtual reality simulator improves
      technical performance of surgical novices in the operating room: a randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 443-8
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000000254 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether individualized
      deliberate practice on a virtual reality (VR) simulator results in improved
      technical performance in the operating room. BACKGROUND: Training on VR
      simulators has been shown to improve technical performance in the operating room 
      (OR). Currently described VR curricula consist of trainees practicing the same
      tasks until expert proficiency is reached. It has yet to be investigated whether 
      the individualized deliberate practice, where curricula tasks vary depending on
      prior levels of technical proficiency, would translate into the OR. METHODS: This
      single-blinded prospective trial randomized 16 novice surgical residents to a
      deliberate practice (DP) group and a conventional residency training group. Both 
      groups performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the OR that was
      video-recorded. Technical performance of DP group residents in the OR was
      assessed using 3 validated assessment tools. A score of less than 60% on any
      component of the assessment tool resulted in the trainee practicing a specific
      task on the VR simulator. The DP group practiced on the simulator as per their
      individualized schedule. Both groups then performed another laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. A blinded expert assessed the OR recordings using a validated
      global rating scale. RESULTS: Although both groups had similar technical
      abilities preintervention [DP: median score, 13.5 (9.3-15.0); control: median
      score, 14.5 (9.3-17.8); P = 0.45], the DP residents had a superior technical
      performance postintervention [DP: median score, 17.0 (15.3-18.5); control: median
      score, 12.5 (7.5-14.0); P = 0.03]. Of 8 DP residents, 6 practiced 5 basic VR
      tasks (median 1 trial to pass), and 7 of 8 practiced 2 advanced tasks (median 4
      trials to pass). CONCLUSIONS: A curriculum of deliberate individualized practice 
      on a VR simulator improves technical performance in the OR. This has implications
      to greatly improve the feasibility of implementing simulation-based curricula in 
      residency training programs, rather then having them being limited to research
      protocols.

      education as measured by performance improvement.
PG  - 333-6

AB  - Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of death in the USA. The need
      for screening colonoscopies, and thus adequately trained endoscopists,
      particularly in rural areas, is on the rise. Recent increases in required
      endoscopic cases for surgical resident graduation by the Surgery Residency Review
      Committee (RRC) further emphasize the need for more effective endoscopic training
      during residency to determine if a virtual reality colonoscopy simulator enhances
      surgical resident endoscopic education by detecting improvement in colonoscopy
      skills before and after 6 weeks of formal clinical endoscopic training. We
      conducted a retrospective review of prospectively collected surgery resident data
      on an endoscopy simulator. Residents performed four different clinical scenarios 
      on the endoscopic simulator before and after a 6-week endoscopic training course.
      Data were collected over a 5-year period from 94 different residents performing a
      total of 795 colonoscopic simulation scenarios. Main outcome measures included
      time to cecal intubation, "red out" time, and severity of simulated patient
      discomfort (mild, moderate, severe, extreme) during colonoscopy scenarios.
      Average time to intubation of the cecum was 6.8 min for those residents who had
      not undergone endoscopic training versus 4.4 min for those who had undergone
      endoscopic training (p < 0.001). Residents who could be compared against
      themselves (pre vs. post-training), cecal intubation times decreased from 7.1 to 
      4.3 min (p < 0.001). Post-endoscopy rotation residents caused less severe
      discomfort during simulated colonoscopy than pre-endoscopy rotation residents (4 
      vs. 10%; p = 0.004). Virtual reality endoscopic simulation is an effective tool
      for both augmenting surgical resident endoscopy cancer education and measuring
      improvement in resident performance after formal clinical endoscopic training.

AB  - A few years ago it could take several hours to complete a 3D image using a 3D
      workstation. Thanks to advances in computer science, obtaining results of
      interest now requires only a few minutes. Many recent 3D workstations or
      multimedia computers are equipped with onboard 3D virtual patient modeling
      software, which enables patient-specific preoperative assessment and virtual
      planning, navigation, and tool positioning. Although medical 3D imaging can now
      be conducted using various modalities, including computed tomography (CT),
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and
      ultrasonography (US) among others, the highest quality images are obtained using 
      CT data, and CT images are now the most commonly used source of data for 3D
      simulation and navigation image. If the 2D source image is bad, no amount of 3D
      image manipulation in software will provide a quality 3D image. In this
      exhibition, the recent advances in CT imaging technique and 3D visualization of
      the hepatobiliary and pancreatic abnormalities are featured, including scan and
      image reconstruction technique, contrast-enhanced techniques, new application of 
      advanced CT scan techniques, and new virtual reality simulation and navigation
      imaging.

TI  - Simulator training and non-technical factors improve laparoscopic performance
      among OBGYN trainees.
PG  - 1194-201
LID - 10.1111/aogs.12218 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate how simulator training and non-technical factors affect
      laparoscopic performance among residents in obstetrics and gynecology. DESIGN: In
      this prospective study, trainees were randomized into three groups. The first
      group was allocated to proficiency-based training in the LapSimGyn((R)) virtual
      reality simulator. The second group received additional structured mentorship
      during subsequent laparoscopies. The third group served as control group. At
      baseline an operation was performed and visuospatial ability, flow and
      self-efficacy were assessed. All groups subsequently performed three tubal
      occlusions. Self-efficacy and flow were assessed before and/or after each
      operation. SETTING: Simulator training was conducted at the Center for Advanced
      Medical Simulation and Training, Karolinska University Hospital. Sterilizations
      were performed at each trainee's home clinic. POPULATION: Twenty-eight
      trainees/residents from 21 hospitals in Sweden were included. METHODS/MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Visuospatial ability was tested by the Mental Rotation Test-A. 
      Flow and self-efficacy were assessed by validated scales and questionnaires.
      Laparoscopic performance was measured as the duration of surgery. Visuospatial
      ability, self-efficacy and flow were correlated to the laparoscopic performance
      using Spearman's correlations. Differences between groups were analyzed by the
      Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: No differences across groups were detected at
      baseline. Self-efficacy scores before and flow scores after the third operation
      were significantly higher in the trained groups. Duration of surgery was
      significantly shorter in the trained groups. Flow and self-efficacy correlate
      positively with laparoscopic performance. CONCLUSIONS: Simulator training and
      non-technical factors appear to improve the laparoscopic performance among
      trainees/residents in obstetrics and gynecology.

TI  - Distribution of innate ability for surgery amongst medical students assessed by
      an advanced virtual reality surgical simulator.
PG  - 1830-7
LID - 10.1007/s00464-013-3393-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgery is a craft profession requiring individuals with specific,
      well-documented innate aptitude for manipulative skills. Yet in most countries,
      the current selection process of surgical trainees does not include aptitude
      testing for the psychomotor and manipulative skills of candidates. METHODS: A
      total of 125 participants (121 medical students and four expert surgeons)
      performed all 26 exercises of the da Vinci Skills Simulator, with six exercises
      being identified as metrics of aptitude for manipulative and psychomotor skills. 
      The expert surgeons were enrolled as the control group to validate the
      performance of the most talented students. RESULTS: Eight students (6.6%)
      significantly outperformed the remaining 113, obtaining a median value of the sum
      of weighted overall score on the six selected exercises of 52.7% versus 21.0% (p 
      < 0.001). In contrast, 14 students (11.6%) performed significantly worse and well
      below the performance of the other 107, with a median value of overall score of
      8.7% versus 24.1 (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference
      between expert surgeons (control group) and the eight talented students (62.1%
      vs. 52.7%, respectively; p = 0.368). No significant correlation between exposure 
      to video games and overall score (rho = 0.330) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In
      terms of innate aptitude for manipulative and psychomotor abilities, the present 
      investigation has documented two subpopulations that fall outside the norm for
      the group of medical students recruited for the study: (i) a small group (6.6%)
      with a high level and (ii) a larger cohort (11.6%) with low level (significantly 
      below the norm) innate aptitude for surgery. Exposure to video game experience
      did not appear to influence performances on the da Vinci Skills Simulator.
