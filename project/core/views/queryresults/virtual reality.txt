TI  - Guidance value of intracranial venous circulation evaluation to parasagittal
      meningioma operation.
PG  - 13508-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is to investigate the value of intracranial venous
      circulation evaluation in guiding the surgery for parasagittal meningioma.
      METHODS: A total of 44 parasagittal meningioma (PSM) patients received 3D CE-MRV 
      scanning. The obtained images were reconstructed by virtual reality (VR)
      technology. Venous collateral circulation was evaluated. Postoperative follow-up 
      was carried out. RESULTS: Among 44 PSM patients, 41 cases were with resection of 
      Simpson grade I/II (93.18%) and 6 cases were with permanent neurological
      dysfunction (13.64%). Venous sinus thrombosis occurred in the remaining 3
      patients (6.82%), with 2 cases cured and 1 case died. The mortality rate was
      2.27%. Recurrence occurred in one case (2.27%) after discharge. In 9 cases, tumor
      adjacent SSS was transected and the poor prognosis rate was 33.33%. SSS was
      opened in 3 cases and after removal of the tumor the broken end was sutured
      directly. The poor prognosis occurred in one case (33.33%). Electrocoagulation
      was carried out to the SSS wall in 32 cases without opening venous sinus and 2
      cases were with poor prognosis (6.25%). The three different venous sinus
      treatment methods had no significantly difference on the prognosis of patients (P
      > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative evaluation of intracranial venous circulation 
      with VR technology and 3D CE-MRV may help making individual surgical plans,
      reduce venous injury and improve the prognosis of PSM patients.

      by the virtual reality technology.
PG  - 12706-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is to investigate the compensatory intracranial venous
      pathways in parasagittal meningiomas (PSM) patients by virtual reality
      technology. METHODS: A total of 48 PSM patients (tumor group) and 20 patients
      with trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm but without intracranial venous
      diseases (control group) were enrolled. All patients underwent 3D CE-MRV
      examination. The 3D reconstructed images by virtual reality technology were used 
      for assessment of diameter and number of intracranial veins, tumor location,
      venous sinus invasion degree and collateral circulation formation. RESULTS:
      Diameter of bridging veins in posterior 1/3 superior sagittal sinus (SSS) in
      tumor group was significantly smaller than that of the control group (P < 0.05). 
      For tumors located in mid 1/3 SSS, diameter of bridging veins and vein of Labbe
      (VL) in posterior 1/3 SSS decreased significantly (P < 0.05). For tumors located 
      in posterior 1/3 SSS, bridging vein number and transverse sinus (TS) diameter
      significantly decreased while superficial Sylvian vein (SSV) diameter increased
      significantly (P < 0.05). Compared with tumor in posterior 1/3 SSS subgroup,
      number of bridging veins in the tumor in mid 1/3 SSS subgroup increased
      significantly (P < 0.05). Compared with control group, only the bridging vein
      number in anterior 1/3 SSS segment in invasion Type 3-4 tumor subgroup decreased 
      significantly (P < 0.05). Diameter of TS and bridging veins in posterior 1/3 SSS 
      segment in sinus invasion Type 5-6 tumor subgroup decreased significantly (P <
      0.05). Compared with control group, only the diameter of VL and TS of collateral 
      circulation Grade 1 tumor subgroup decreased significantly (P < 0.05) while in
      Grade 3 tumor subgroup, TS diameter decreased and SSV diameter increased
      significantly (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The intracranial blood flow is mainly
      drained through SSV drainage after SSS occlusion by PSM.

AB  - Emotions can modulate the encoding and recollection of personal events. In the
      present study, we investigated the effects of different emotional states
      (pleasant, neutral or anxious) on episodic memory formation in a virtual reality 
      (VR) setting. Emotional states were induced by the presentation of pleasant,
      neutral or anxiety-inducing movie clips prior to encountering specific events in 
      a VR scenario. Episodic memory performance of healthy participants in which an
      anxious emotional state had been induced was inferior to those of the neutral and
      pleasant conditions. In the anxious condition, participants were particularly
      impaired regarding their memory for the location of events. A correlational
      analysis indicated that high levels of negative arousal were associated with poor
      memory for the temporal and spatial context of events. In contrast, high levels
      of happiness were associated with better memory for the spatial context of
      events. Our data provide evidence that emotional arousal can modulate memory for 
      what happened, where and when.

LID - 10.1111/eje.12173 [doi]
AB  - Compared with traditional dental training methods, virtual reality training
      systems integrated with multisensory feedback possess potentials advantages.
      However, there exist many technical challenges in developing a satisfactory
      simulator. In this manuscript, we systematically survey several current dental
      training systems to identify the gaps between the capabilities of these systems
      and the clinical training requirements. After briefly summarising the components,
      functions and unique features of each system, we discuss the technical challenges
      behind these systems including the software, hardware and user evaluation
      methods. Finally, the clinical requirements of an ideal dental training system
      are proposed. Future research/development areas are identified based on an
      analysis of the gaps between current systems and clinical training requirements.

LID - 10.4244/EIJY15M06_05 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to explore if proficiency-based training in a
      coronary angiography (CA) simulator can transfer acquired skills from virtual
      reality (VR) to the real world in order to improve early performance. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Sixteen senior cardiology residents were randomised to proficiency-based
      VR training or control. Two consecutive CAs were performed on patients. Skills
      metrics and errors were compared between the groups. Thirty-two CAs were
      performed under the supervision of an experienced interventionalist. VR-trained
      residents practised for a mean of 10 hours in a CA simulator. In real life, the
      VR-trained group had shorter fluoroscopy and total procedure times than the
      controls (median 558 vs. 842 seconds, p=0.003 and 1,356 vs. 1,623 seconds,
      p=0.032, respectively). The controls had a higher error score (median 27 vs. 15, 
      p=0.002) and a lower performance score (median 47 vs. 68, p=0.006) than the
      VR-trained residents. CONCLUSIONS: Simulator-based training in CA improved skills
      and decreased errors compared to mentor-based training only. CA training in VR
      resulted in a superior performance, measured by fluoroscopy and total procedure
      times, and superior error and performance scores, thereby confirming transfer
      validity. Our recommendation is to incorporate VR training in the curriculum for 
      the general cardiologist to improve safe learning in CA.

TI  - Evaluation of trainees' ability to perform obstetrical ultrasound using
      simulation: challenges and opportunities.
LID - S0002-9378(15)02237-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ajog.2015.10.932 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of trainee's ability in obstetrical ultrasound is a
      time-consuming process, which requires involving patients as volunteers. With the
      use of obstetrical ultrasound simulators, virtual reality could help assessing
      competency and evaluating trainees in this field. OBJECTIVE: To test the validity
      of an obstetrical ultrasound simulator as a tool for evaluating trainees
      following structured training by comparing scores obtained on obstetrical
      ultrasound simulator to those obtained on volunteers, and by assessing
      correlations between scores of images and of dexterity given by two blinded
      examiners. STUDY DESIGN: Trainees, taking the 2013 French national exam for the
      practice of Obstetrical Ultrasound were asked to obtain standardized ultrasound
      planes both on volunteer pregnant women and on obstetrical ultrasound simulator. 
      These planes included measurements of biparietal diameter, abdominal
      circumference, femur length, as well as reference planes for cardiac 4-chamber
      and outflow tracts, kidneys, stomach/diaphragm, spine and face. Images were
      stored and evaluated subsequently by two national examiners who scored each
      picture according to previously established quality criteria. Dexterity was also 
      evaluated and subjectively scored between 0 and 10. The Raghunathan's
      modification of Pearson, Filon's z, Spearman's rank correlation and Anova tests
      were used to assess correlations between the scores by the two examiners, scores 
      of dexterity and also to compare the final scores between the 2 different
      methods. RESULTS: We evaluated 29 trainees. The mean dexterity scores in
      simulation (6.5+/-2.0) and real examination (5.9+/-2.3) were comparable (P =
      0.31). Scores with obstetrical ultrasound simulator were significantly higher
      than those obtained on volunteers (P = 0.027). Nevertheless, there was a good
      correlation between scores of the 2 examiners judging on simulation (R = 0.888)
      and on volunteers (R = 0.873), (P = 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Obstetrical ultrasound
      simulator is as good a method as volunteer-based examination for evaluating
      practical skills in trainees following structured training in obstetrical
      ultrasound. The threshold for success/failure should however be adapted, as
      candidates obtain higher scores on the simulator. Advantages of the obstetrical
      ultrasound simulator include absence of location and time constraints without the
      need to involve volunteers or to interfere with the running of ultrasound
      clinics. However obstetrical ultrasound simulator still lacks the ability to
      evaluate the trainees' ability to interact with patients.

TI  - Effectiveness of a Novel Augmented Reality-Based Navigation System in Treatment
      of Orbital Hypertelorism.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Augmented reality (AR) technology can superimpose the virtual image
      generated by computer onto the real operating field to present an integral image 
      to enhance surgical safety. The purpose of our study is to develop a novel
      AR-based navigation system for craniofacial surgery. We focus on orbital
      hypertelorism correction, because the surgery requires high preciseness and is
      considered tough even for senior craniofacial surgeon. METHODS: Twelve patients
      with orbital hypertelorism were selected. The preoperative computed tomography
      data were imported into 3-dimensional platform for preoperational design. The
      position and orientation of virtual information and real world were adjusted by
      image registration process. The AR toolkits were used to realize the integral
      image. Afterward, computed tomography was also performed after operation for
      comparing the difference between preoperational plan and actual operational
      outcome. RESULTS: Our AR-based navigation system was successfully used in these
      patients, directly displaying 3-dimensional navigational information onto the
      surgical field. They all achieved a better appearance by the guidance of
      navigation image. The difference in interdacryon distance and the dacryon point
      of each side appear no significant (P > 0.05) between preoperational plan and
      actual surgical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports on an effective
      visualized approach for guiding orbital hypertelorism correction. Our AR-based
      navigation system may lay a foundation for craniofacial surgery navigation. The
      AR technology could be considered as a helpful tool for precise osteotomy in
      craniofacial surgery.

TI  - Online Peer-to-Peer Support for Young People With Mental Health Problems: A
      Systematic Review.
PG  - e19
LID - 10.2196/mental.4418 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescence and early adulthood are critical periods for the
      development of mental disorders. Online peer-to-peer communication is popular
      among young people and may improve mental health by providing social support.
      Previous systematic reviews have targeted Internet support groups for adults with
      mental health problems, including depression. However, there have been no
      systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of online peer-to-peer support in 
      improving the mental health of adolescents and young adults. OBJECTIVE: The aim
      of this review was to systematically identify available evidence for the
      effectiveness of online peer-to peer support for young people with mental health 
      problems. METHODS: The PubMed, PsycInfo, and Cochrane databases were searched
      using keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Retrieved abstracts
      (n=3934) were double screened and coded. Studies were included if they (1)
      investigated an online peer-to-peer interaction, (2) the interaction discussed
      topics related to mental health, (3) the age range of the sample was between 12
      to 25 years, and (4) the study evaluated the effectiveness of the peer-to-peer
      interaction. RESULTS: Six studies satisfied the inclusion criteria for the
      current review. The studies targeted a range of mental health problems including 
      depression and anxiety (n=2), general psychological problems (n=1), eating
      disorders (n=1), and substance use (tobacco) (n=2). The majority of studies
      investigated Internet support groups (n=4), and the remaining studies focused on 
      virtual reality chat sessions (n=2). In almost all studies (n=5), the peer
      support intervention was moderated by health professionals, researchers or
      consumers. Studies employed a range of study designs including randomized
      controlled trials (n=3), pre-post studies (n=2) and one randomized trial.
      Overall, two of the randomized controlled trials were associated with a
      significant positive outcome in comparison to the control group at
      post-intervention. In the remaining four studies, peer-to-peer support was not
      found to be effective. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review identified an overall 
      lack of high-quality studies examining online peer-to-peer support for young
      people. Given that peer support is frequently used as an adjunct to Internet
      interventions for a variety of mental health conditions, there is an urgent need 
      to determine the effectiveness of peer support alone as an active intervention.

AB  - A distorted body representation is a core symptom in eating disorders (EDs),
      though its mechanism is unclear. Allocentric lock theory, emphasising the role of
      reference frame processing in body image, suggests that ED patients may be
      (b)locked to an (allocentric) representation of their own body stored in
      long-term memory (e.g., my body is fat) that is not updated (modified) by the
      (real-time egocentric) perception-driven experience of the physical body.
      Employing a well-validated virtual reality-based procedure, relative to healthy
      controls, ED patients showed deficits in the ability to refer to and update a
      long-term stored (allocentric) representation with (egocentric) perceptual-driven
      inputs.

TI  - A Decade of Progress Using Virtual Reality for Poststroke Lower Extremity
      Rehabilitation: Systematic Review of the Intervention Methods.
PG  - 342529
LID - 10.1155/2015/342529 [doi]
AB  - Objective. To develop a systematic review of the literature, to describe the
      different virtual reality (VR) interventions and interactive videogames applied
      to the lower extremity (LE) of stroke patients, and to analyse the results
      according to the most frequently used outcome measures. Material and Methods. An 
      electronic search of randomized trials between January 2004 and January 2014 in
      different databases (Medline, Cinahl, Web of Science, PEDro, and Cochrane) was
      carried out. Several terms (virtual reality, feedback, stroke, hemiplegia, brain 
      injury, cerebrovascular accident, lower limb, leg, and gait) were combined, and
      finally 11 articles were included according to the established inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. Results. The reviewed trials showed a high heterogeneity in
      terms of study design and assessment tools, which makes it difficult to compare
      and analyze the different types of interventions. However, most of them found a
      significant improvement on gait speed, balance and motor function, due to VR
      intervention. Conclusions. Although evidence is limited, it suggests that VR
      intervention (more than 10 sessions) in stroke patients may have a positive
      impact on balance, and gait recovery. Better results were obtained when a
      multimodal approach, combining VR and conventional physiotherapy, was used.
      Flexible software seems to adapt better to patients' requirements, allowing more 
      specific and individual treatments.

TI  - The Principles of Magic Applied to Healthcare Simulation.
AB  - STATEMENT: Five principles of magic are described that directly relate to
      enhancing participant engagement in the healthcare simulation setting. The
      principles discussed are the following: reality is in the mind of the
      participant, attention is easily misdirected, perception can be manipulated,
      various cognitive biases can be exploited, and focus must be captured. Using
      these principles in a healthcare simulation can help fill gaps in fidelity and
      bring a participant to a point where the situation and events make sense to them,
      they feel that they are in an appropriate environment, and they are willing to
      forgive the natural flaws of the simulation itself. Misuse of illusions beyond
      the purpose of filling fidelity gaps can break trust with the teacher and lead to
      disengagement of the participant.

TI  - Reliability and Minimum Detectable Change of Temporal-Spatial, Kinematic, and
      Dynamic Stability Measures during Perturbed Gait.
PG  - e0142083
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0142083 [doi]
AB  - Temporal-spatial, kinematic variability, and dynamic stability measures collected
      during perturbation-based assessment paradigms are often used to identify
      dysfunction associated with gait instability. However, it remains unclear which
      measures are most reliable for detecting and tracking responses to perturbations.
      This study systematically determined the between-session reliability and minimum 
      detectable change values of temporal-spatial, kinematic variability, and dynamic 
      stability measures during three types of perturbed gait. Twenty young healthy
      adults completed two identical testing sessions two weeks apart, comprised of an 
      unperturbed and three perturbed (cognitive, physical, and visual) walking
      conditions in a virtual reality environment. Within each session, perturbation
      responses were compared to unperturbed walking using paired t-tests.
      Between-session reliability and minimum detectable change values were also
      calculated for each measure and condition. All temporal-spatial, kinematic
      variability and dynamic stability measures demonstrated fair to excellent
      between-session reliability. Minimal detectable change values, normalized to mean
      values ranged from 1-50%. Step width mean and variability measures demonstrated
      the greatest response to perturbations with excellent between-session reliability
      and low minimum detectable change values. Orbital stability measures demonstrated
      specificity to perturbation direction and sensitivity with excellent
      between-session reliability and low minimum detectable change values. We observed
      substantially greater between-session reliability and lower minimum detectable
      change values for local stability measures than previously described which may be
      the result of averaging across trials within a session and using velocity versus 
      acceleration data for reconstruction of state spaces. Across all perturbation
      types, temporal-spatial, orbital and local measures were the most reliable
      measures with the lowest minimum detectable change values, supporting their use
      for tracking changes over multiple testing sessions. The between-session
      reliability and minimum detectable change values reported here provide an
      objective means for interpreting changes in temporal-spatial, kinematic
      variability, and dynamic stability measures during perturbed walking which may
      assist in identifying instability.

PG  - 179-86
LID - 10.1007/s11701-015-0513-4 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this randomized, controlled trial was to assess whether
      voluntary participation in a proctored, proficiency-based, virtual reality
      robotic suturing curriculum using the da Vinci((R)) Skills Simulator improves
      robotic suturing performance. Residents and attending surgeons were randomized to
      participation or non-participation during a 5 week training curriculum. Robotic
      suturing skills were evaluated before and after training using an inanimate
      vaginal cuff model, which participants sutured for 10 min using the da Vinci((R))
      Surgical System. Performances were videotaped, anonymized, and subsequently
      graded independently by three robotic surgeons. 27 participants were randomized. 
      23 of the 27 completed both the pre- and post-test, 13 in the training group and 
      10 in the control group. Mean training time in the intervention group was 238 +/-
      136 min (SD) over the 5 weeks. The primary outcome (improvement in GOALS+ score) 
      and the secondary outcomes (improvement in GEARS, total knots, satisfactory
      knots, and the virtual reality suture sponge 1 task) were significantly greater
      in the training group than the control group in unadjusted analysis. After
      adjusting for lower baseline scores in the training group, improvement in the
      suture sponge 1 task remained significantly greater in the training group and a
      trend was demonstrated to greater improvement in the training group for the
      GOALS+ score, GEARS score, total knots, and satisfactory knots.

AB  - Psychologists have long studied links between physiology and subjective feelings,
      but little is known about how those links are preserved in memory. Here we
      examine this question via arousal, a subjective feeling with strong physiological
      correlates. Using virtual reality, we immersed participants in a threatening
      scene (Room 101) where they confronted a variety of disturbing events. Later,
      participants watched the scene on a desktop computer while continuously rating
      how aroused they remembered feeling. Analyses of those time series revealed that 
      retrospective reports were coherent with participants' unique patterns in
      physiological arousal (skin conductance and heart rate) during the original
      events. Analyses further revealed that coherence did not depend on simulating
      physiological arousal and that it was particularly strong among individuals high 
      in interoceptive accuracy. These data demonstrate that memory encodes
      physiological information during emotional episodes such that individuals' recall
      of arousal reliably reflects physiological signals as they unfolded over time.

      Varying Materials on Mobile Devices.
PG  - 1349-62
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2450717 [doi]
AB  - At present, photorealistic augmentation is not yet possible since the
      computational power of mobile devices is insufficient. Even streaming solutions
      from stationary PCs cause a latency that affects user interactions considerably. 
      Therefore, we introduce a differential rendering method that allows for a
      consistent illumination of the inserted virtual objects on mobile devices,
      avoiding delays. The computation effort is shared between a stationary PC and the
      mobile devices to make use of the capacities available on both sides. The method 
      is designed such that only a minimum amount of data has to be transferred
      asynchronously between the participants. This allows for an interactive
      illumination of virtual objects with a consistent appearance under both
      temporally and spatially varying real illumination conditions. To describe the
      complex near-field illumination in an indoor scenario, HDR video cameras are used
      to capture the illumination from multiple directions. In this way, sources of
      illumination can be considered that are not directly visible to the mobile device
      because of occlusions and the limited field of view. While our method focuses on 
      Lambertian materials, we also provide some initial approaches to approximate
      non-diffuse virtual objects and thereby allow for a wider field of application at
      nearly the same cost.

TI  - Evolution of tonal organization in music mirrors symbolic representation of
      perceptual reality. Part-1: Prehistoric.
PG  - 1405
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01405 [doi]
AB  - This paper reveals the way in which musical pitch works as a peculiar form of
      cognition that reflects upon the organization of the surrounding world as
      perceived by majority of music users within a socio-cultural formation. The
      evidence from music theory, ethnography, archeology, organology, anthropology,
      psychoacoustics, and evolutionary biology is plotted against experimental
      evidence. Much of the methodology for this investigation comes from studies
      conducted within the territory of the former USSR. To date, this methodology has 
      remained solely confined to Russian speaking scholars. A brief overview of
      pitch-set theory demonstrates the need to distinguish between vertical and
      horizontal harmony, laying out the framework for virtual music space that
      operates according to the perceptual laws of tonal gravity. Brought to life by
      bifurcation of music and speech, tonal gravity passed through eleven discrete
      stages of development until the onset of tonality in the seventeenth century.
      Each stage presents its own method of integration of separate musical tones into 
      an auditory-cognitive unity. The theory of "melodic intonation" is set forth as a
      counterpart to harmonic theory of chords. Notions of tonality, modality, key,
      diatonicity, chromaticism, alteration, and modulation are defined in terms of
      their perception, and categorized according to the way in which they have
      developed historically. Tonal organization in music, and perspective organization
      in fine arts are explained as products of the same underlying mental process.
      Music seems to act as a unique medium of symbolic representation of reality
      through the concept of pitch. Tonal organization of pitch reflects the culture of
      thinking, adopted as a standard within a community of music users. Tonal
      organization might be a naturally formed system of optimizing individual
      perception of reality within a social group and its immediate environment,
      setting conventional standards of intellectual and emotional intelligence.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) is now commonly used in many domains because of its ability 
      to provide a standardized, reproducible and controllable environment. In balance 
      assessment, it can be used to control stimuli presented to patients and thus
      accurately evaluate their progression or compare them to different populations in
      standardized situations. In balance rehabilitation, VR allows the creation of new
      generation tools and at the same time the means to assess the efficiency of each 
      parameter of these tools in order to optimize them. Moreover, with the
      development of low-cost devices, this rehabilitation can be continued at home,
      making access to these tools much easier, in addition to their entertaining and
      thus motivating properties. Nevertheless, and even more with low-cost systems, VR
      has limits that can alter the results of the studies that use it: the latency of 
      the system (the delay cumulated on each step of the process from data acquisition
      on the patients to multimodal outputs); and distance perception, which tends to
      be underestimated in VR. After having described why VR is an essential tool for
      balance assessment and rehabilitation and illustrated this statement with a case 
      study, this review discusses the previous works in the domain with regards to the
      technological limits of VR.

TI  - Optic flow improves adaptability of spatiotemporal characteristics during
      split-belt locomotor adaptation with tactile stimulation.
AB  - Human locomotor adaptation requires feedback and feed-forward control processes
      to maintain an appropriate walking pattern. Adaptation may require the use of
      visual and proprioceptive input to decode altered movement dynamics and generate 
      an appropriate response. After a person transfers from an extreme sensory
      environment and back, as astronauts do when they return from spaceflight, the
      prolonged period required for re-adaptation can pose a significant burden. In our
      previous paper, we showed that plantar tactile vibration during a split-belt
      adaptation task did not interfere with the treadmill adaptation however, larger
      overground transfer effects with a slower decay resulted. Such effects, in the
      absence of visual feedback (of motion) and perturbation of tactile feedback, are 
      believed to be due to a higher proprioceptive gain because, in the absence of
      relevant external dynamic cues such as optic flow, reliance on body-based cues is
      enhanced during gait tasks through multisensory integration. In this study, we
      therefore investigated the effect of optic flow on tactile-stimulated split-belt 
      adaptation as a paradigm to facilitate the sensorimotor adaptation process.
      Twenty healthy young adults, separated into two matched groups, participated in
      the study. All participants performed an overground walking trial followed by a
      split-belt treadmill adaptation protocol. The tactile group (TC) received
      vibratory plantar tactile stimulation only, whereas the virtual reality and
      tactile group (VRT) received an additional concurrent visual stimulation: a
      moving virtual corridor, inducing perceived self-motion. A post-treadmill
      overground trial was performed to determine adaptation transfer. Interlimb
      coordination of spatiotemporal and kinetic variables was quantified using
      symmetry indices and analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Marked changes of
      step length characteristics were observed in both groups during split-belt
      adaptation. Stance and swing time symmetries were similar in the two groups,
      suggesting that temporal parameters are not modified by optic flow. However,
      whereas the TC group displayed significant stance time asymmetries during the
      post-treadmill session, such aftereffects were absent in the VRT group. The
      results indicated that the enhanced transfer resulting from exposure to plantar
      cutaneous vibration during adaptation was alleviated by optic flow information.
      The presence of visual self-motion information may have reduced proprioceptive
      gain during learning. Thus, during overground walking, the learned proprioceptive
      split-belt pattern is more rapidly overridden by visual input due to its
      increased relative gain. The results suggest that when visual stimulation is
      provided during adaptive training, the system acquires the novel movement
      dynamics while maintaining the ability to flexibly adapt to different
      environments.

AB  - This review covers the rationale, mechanisms, and availability of commercially
      available virtual environment-based interventions for stroke rehabilitation. It
      describes interventions for motor, speech, cognitive, and sensory dysfunction.
      Also discussed are the important features and mechanisms that allow virtual
      environments to facilitate motor relearning. A common challenge is the inability 
      to translate success in small trials to efficacy in larger populations. The
      heterogeneity of stroke pathophysiology has been blamed, and experts advocate for
      the study of multimodal approaches. Therefore, this article also introduces a
      framework to help define new therapy combinations that may be necessary to
      address stroke heterogeneity.

TI  - Fostering Learning Through Interprofessional Virtual Reality Simulation
      Development.
PG  - 335-6
AB  - This article presents a unique strategy for improving didactic learning and
      clinical skill while simultaneously fostering interprofessional collaboration and
      communication. Senior-level nursing students collaborated with students enrolled 
      in the Department of Interactive Media Studies to design a virtual reality
      simulation based upon disaster management and triage techniques. Collaborative
      creation of the simulation proved to be a strategy for enhancing students'
      knowledge of and skill in disaster management and triage while impacting
      attitudes about interprofessional communication and teamwork.

TI  - Randomized clinical trial to examine procedure-to-procedure transfer in
      laparoscopic simulator training.
LID - 10.1002/bjs.9966 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic simulation has become a standard component of surgical
      training, but there is limited knowledge regarding skills transfer between
      procedural tasks. The objective was to investigate the specificity of procedural 
      simulator training. METHODS: This was randomized single-centre educational
      superiority trial. Surgical novices practised basic skills on a laparoscopic
      virtual reality simulator. On reaching proficiency, participants were randomized 
      to proficiency-based training. The intervention group practised two procedures on
      the simulator (appendicectomy followed by salpingectomy), whereas the control
      group trained on only one procedure (salpingectomy). The main outcomes were
      number of repetitions and time to proficiency for the second procedure. RESULTS: 
      Ninety-six participants were randomized, of whom 74 per cent were women, with a
      median age of 26 years. The intervention group needed significantly fewer
      attempts than the control group to reach proficiency in the second procedure:
      median (i.q.r.) 22 (17-34) versus 32 (26-41) attempts, which corresponded to 24.1
      per cent fewer attempts as assessed by multivariable analysis (P = 0.004). The
      intervention group required significantly less time than the control group to
      reach proficiency: median (i.q.r.) 88 (63-127) versus 131 (101-153) min
      respectively, corresponding to a difference of 31.1 min as assessed by
      multivariable analysis (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Practising two procedures,
      compared with only one, reduced the number of attempts and time to reach
      proficiency in the second procedure. Skills transfer is seen between two tasks in
      laparoscopic simulator training; however, task specificity is still present when 
      practising procedures. Registration number: NCT02069951

TI  - Virtual Reality Body Swapping: A Tool for Modifying the Allocentric Memory of the
      Body.
AB  - An increasing amount of evidence has shown that embodiment of a virtual body via 
      visuo-tactile stimulation can lead to an altered perception of body and object
      size. The current study aimed to investigate whether virtual reality (VR) body
      swapping can be an effective tool for modifying the enduring memory of the body. 
      The experimental sample included 21 female participants who were asked to
      estimate the width and circumference of different body parts before any kind of
      stimulation and after two types of body swapping illusions ("synchronous
      visuo-tactile stimulation" and "asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation").
      Findings revealed that after participants embodied a virtual body with a skinny
      belly (independently of the type of visuo-tactile stimulation), there was an
      update of the stored representation of the body: participants reported a decrease
      in the ratio between estimated and actual body measures for most of the body
      parts considered. Based on the Allocentric Lock Theory, these findings provide
      first evidence that VR body swapping is able to induce a change in the memory of 
      the body. This knowledge may be potentially useful for patients suffering from
      eating and weight disorders.

TI  - Differential Sensitivity Between a Virtual Reality Balance Module and Clinically 
      Used Concussion Balance Modalities.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Balance assessments are part of the recommended clinical concussion
      evaluation, along with computerized neuropsychological testing and self-reported 
      symptoms checklists. New technology has allowed for the creation of virtual
      reality (VR) balance assessments to be used in concussion care, but there is
      little information on the sensitivity and specificity of these evaluations. The
      purpose of this study is to establish the sensitivity and specificity of a VR
      balance module for detecting lingering balance deficits clinical concussion care.
      DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. SETTING: Institutional research
      laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Normal controls (n = 94) and concussed participants (n 
      = 27). INTERVENTIONS: All participants completed a VR balance assessment
      paradigm. Concussed participants were diagnosed by a Certified Athletic Trainer
      or physician (with 48 hours postinjury) and tested in the laboratory between 7
      and 10 days postinjury. Receiver operating characteristic curves were performed
      to establish the VR module's sensitivity and specificity for detecting lingering 
      balance deficits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Final balance score. RESULTS: For the VR
      balance module, a cutoff score of 8.25 was established to maximize sensitivity at
      85.7% and specificity at 87.8%. CONCLUSIONS: The VR balance module has high
      sensitivity and specificity for detecting subacute balance deficits after
      concussive injury. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The VR balance has a high subacute
      sensitivity and specificity as a stand-alone balance assessment tool and may
      detect ongoing balance deficits not readily detectable by the Balance Error
      Scoring System or Sensory Organization Test. Virtual reality balance modules may 
      be a beneficial addition to the current clinical concussion diagnostic battery.

TI  - Effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy integrated with systematic
      desensitization, cognitive behavioral therapy combined with eye movement
      desensitization and reprocessing therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy
      combined with virtual reality exposure therapy methods in the treatment of flight
      anxiety: a randomized trial.
PG  - 2591-8
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S93401 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the research was to compare the effectiveness of the following
      treatment methods for fear of flying: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
      integrated with systematic desensitization, CBT combined with eye movement
      desensitization and reprocessing therapy, and CBT combined with virtual reality
      exposure therapy. Overall, our findings have proven the efficacy of all
      interventions in reducing fear of flying in a pre- to post-treatment comparison. 
      All groups showed a decrease in flight anxiety, suggesting the efficiency of all 
      three treatments in reducing self-report measures of fear of flying. In
      particular, our results indicated significant improvements for the treated
      patients using all the treatment programs, as shown not only by test scores but
      also by participation in the post-treatment flight. Nevertheless, outcome
      measures maintained a significant effect at a 1-year follow-up. In conclusion,
      combining CBT with both the application of eye movement desensitization and
      reprocessing treatment and the virtual stimuli used to expose patients with
      aerophobia seemed as efficient as traditional cognitive behavioral treatments
      integrated with systematic desensitization.

AB  - [Purpose] The purpose of this review was to investigate various types of VR
      programs and their use in cognitive evaluations and interventions for patients
      with brain injury. [Subjects and Methods] PubMed, Cochrane, and OTseeker
      electronic databases were searched with the search terms. At of 350 titles and
      abstracts were retrieved, and 17 articles were selected for this review. Selected
      articles were assessed on the level of evidence using the Physiotherapy Evidence 
      Database (PEDro) scale. [Results] Articles assessing the impact of cognitive
      impairments in memory were most commonly found, and VR interventions elicited
      positive effects in patients with brain injury. [Conclusion] VR can be considered
      a new tool for cognitive rehabilitation after brain injury. VR interventions also
      have a number of advantages, e.g. cost-effectiveness, compared to other
      interventions.

AB  - [Purpose] This study evaluated the acute cardiovascular responses during a
      session of Zumba((R)) Fitness in a virtual reality environment. [Subjects]
      Eighteen healthy volunteers were recruited. [Methods] The following
      cardiovascular variables: heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood
      pressure, and double product were assessed before and after the practice of
      virtual Zumba((R)), which was performed as a continuous sequence of five
      choreographed movements lasting for 22 min. The game Zumba Fitness Core((R)),
      with the Kinect-based virtual reality system for the XBOX 360, was used to create
      the virtual environment. Comparisons were made among mean delta values
      (delta=post-Zumba((R)) minus pre-Zumba((R)) values) for systolic and diastolic
      blood pressure, heart rate, and double product using Student's t-test for paired 
      samples. [Results] After a single session, a significant increase was noted in
      all the analyzed parameters (Systolic blood pressure=18%; Diastolic blood
      pressure=13%; Heart rate=67%; and Double product=97%). [Conclusion] The results
      support the feasibility of the use of Zumba Fitness Core((R)) with the
      Kinect-based virtual reality system for the XBOX 360 in physical activity
      programs and further favor its indication for this purpose.

PG  - 1037-46
LID - 10.1097/OPX.0000000000000702 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this pilot study was to assess the driving performance and
      the visual search behavior, that is, eye and head movements, of patients with
      glaucoma in comparison to healthy-sighted subjects during a simulated driving
      test. METHODS: Driving performance and gaze behavior of six glaucoma patients and
      eight healthy-sighted age- and sex-matched control subjects were compared in an
      advanced driving simulator. All subjects underwent a 40-minute driving test
      including nine hazardous situations on city and rural roads. Fitness to drive was
      assessed by a masked driving instructor according to the requirements of the
      official German driving test. Several driving performance measures were
      investigated: lane position, time to line crossing, and speed. Additionally, eye 
      and head movements were tracked and analyzed. RESULTS: Three out of six glaucoma 
      patients passed the driving test and their driving performance was
      indistinguishable from that of the control group. Patients who passed the test
      showed an increased visual exploration in comparison to patients who failed; that
      is, they showed increased number of head and gaze movements toward eccentric
      regions. Furthermore, patients who failed the test showed a rightward bias in
      average lane position, probably in an attempt to maximize the safety margin to
      oncoming traffic. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that a considerable subgroup of
      subjects with binocular glaucomatous visual field loss shows a safe driving
      behavior in a virtual reality environment, because they adapt their viewing
      behavior by increasing their visual scanning. Hence, binocular visual field loss 
      does not necessarily influence driving safety. We recommend that more
      individualized driving assessments, which will take into account the patient's
      ability to compensate, are required.

TI  - Working alliance inventory applied to virtual and augmented reality (WAI-VAR):
      psychometrics and therapeutic outcomes.
PG  - 1531
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01531 [doi]
AB  - This study examines the psychometric properties of the Working Alliance
      Inventory-Short (WAI-S) adaptation to Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality 
      (AR) therapies (WAI-VAR). The relationship between the therapeutic alliance (TA) 
      with VR and AR and clinically significant change (CSC) is also explored.
      Seventy-five patients took part in this study (74.7% women, M age = 34.41). Fear 
      of flying and adjustment disorder patients received VR therapy, and cockroach
      phobia patients received AR therapy. Psychometric properties, CSC, one-way ANOVA,
      Spearman's Correlations and Multiple Regression were calculated. The WAI-VAR
      showed a unidimensional structure, high internal consistency and adequate
      convergent validity. "Not changed" patients scored lower on the WAI-VAR than
      "improved" and "recovered" patients. Correlation between the WAI-VAR and CSC was 
      moderate. The best fitting model for predicting CSC was a linear combination of
      the TA with therapist (WAI-S) and the TA with VR and AR (WAI-VAR), due to the
      latter variable slightly increased the percentage of variability accounted for in
      CSC. The WAI-VAR is the first validated instrument to measure the TA with VR and 
      AR in research and clinical practice. This study reveals the importance of the
      quality of the TA with technologies in achieving positive outcomes in the
      therapy.

TI  - Detecting Lateral Motion using Light's Orbital Angular Momentum.
PG  - 15422
LID - 10.1038/srep15422 [doi]
AB  - Interrogating an object with a light beam and analyzing the scattered light can
      reveal kinematic information about the object, which is vital for applications
      ranging from autonomous vehicles to gesture recognition and virtual reality. We
      show that by analyzing the change in the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of a
      tilted light beam eclipsed by a moving object, lateral motion of the object can
      be detected in an arbitrary direction using a single light beam and without
      object image reconstruction. We observe OAM spectral asymmetry that corresponds
      to the lateral motion direction along an arbitrary axis perpendicular to the
      plane containing the light beam and OAM measurement axes. These findings extend
      OAM-based remote sensing to detection of non-rotational qualities of objects and 
      may also have extensions to other electromagnetic wave regimes, including radio
      and sound.

TI  - Teaching basic fiberoptic intubation skills in a simulator: initial learning and 
      skills decay.
AB  - PURPOSE: Generally, novices are taught fiberoptic intubation on patients by
      attending anesthesiologists; however, this approach raises patient safety
      concerns. Patient safety should improve if novice learners are trained for basic 
      skills on simulators. In this educational study, we assessed the time and number 
      of attempts required to train novices in fiberoptic bronchoscopy and fiberoptic
      intubation on simulators. Because decay in skills is inevitable, we also assessed
      fiberoptic bronchoscopy and fiberoptic intubation skill decay and the amount of
      effort required to regain fiberoptic bronchoscopy skill. METHODS: First, we
      established attempt- and duration-based quantitative norms for reaching skill
      proficiency for fiberoptic bronchoscopy and fiberoptic intubation by experienced 
      anesthesiologists (n = 8) and prepared an 11-step checklist and a 5-point global 
      rating scale for assessment. Novice learners (n = 15) were trained to reach the
      established skill proficiency in a Virtual Reality simulator for fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy skills and a Human Airway Anatomy Simulator for fiberoptic
      intubation skills. Two months later, novices were reassessed to determine decay
      in learned skills and the required time to retrain them to fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy proficiency level. RESULTS: Proficiency in fiberoptic bronchoscopy
      skill level was achieved with 11 +/- 5 attempts and after 658 +/- 351 s. After 2 
      months without practice, the time taken by the novices to successful fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy on the Virtual Reality simulator increased from 41 +/- 8 to 68 +/-
      31 s (P = 0.0138). Time and attempts required to retrain them were 424 +/- 230 s 
      and 9.1 +/- 4.6 attempts, respectively. CONCLUSION: Novices were successfully
      trained to proficiency skill level. Although fiberoptic bronchoscopy skills
      started to decay within 2 months, the re-training time was shorter.

TI  - Laparoscopic simulation training in gynaecology: Current provision and staff
      attitudes - a cross-sectional survey.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - The objectives of this study were to explore current provision of laparoscopic
      simulation training, and to determine attitudes of trainers and trainees to the
      role of simulators in surgical training across the UK. An anonymous
      cross-sectional survey with cluster sampling was developed and circulated. All
      Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Training Programme
      Directors (TPD), College Tutors (RCT) and Trainee representatives (TR) across the
      UK were invited to participate. One hundred and ninety-six obstetricians and
      gynaecologists participated. Sixty-three percent of hospitals had at least one
      box trainer, and 14.6% had least one virtual-reality simulator. Only 9.3% and
      3.6% stated that trainees used a structured curriculum on box and virtual-reality
      simulators, respectively. Respondents working in a Large/Teaching hospital (p =
      0.008) were more likely to agree that simulators enhance surgical training.
      Eighty-nine percent agreed that simulators improve the quality of training, and
      should be mandatory or desirable for junior trainees. Consultants (p = 0.003) and
      respondents over 40 years (p = 0.011) were more likely to hold that a simulation 
      test should be undertaken before live operation. Our data demonstrated,
      therefore, that availability of laparoscopic simulators is inconsistent, with
      limited use of mandatory structured curricula. In contrast, both trainers and
      trainees recognise a need for greater use of laparoscopic simulation for surgical
      training.

TI  - Virtual reality exposure-based therapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress
      disorder: a review of its efficacy, the adequacy of the treatment protocol, and
      its acceptability.
PG  - 2533-45
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S89542 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The essential feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is
      the development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to one or more
      traumatic events. According to evidence-based intervention guidelines and
      empirical evidence, one of the most extensively researched and validated
      treatments for PTSD is prolonged exposure to traumatic events; however, exposure 
      therapy can present some limitations. Virtual reality (VR) can help to improve
      prolonged exposure because it creates fictitious, safe, and controllable
      situations that can enhance emotional engagement and acceptance. OBJECTIVE: In
      addition to carrying out a review to evaluate the efficacy of VR exposure-based
      therapy (VR-EBT) for the treatment of PTSD, the aim of this study was to
      contribute to analyzing the use of VR-EBT by: first, evaluating the adequacy of
      psychological treatment protocols that use VR-EBT to treat PTSD; and second,
      analyzing the acceptability of VR-EBT. METHOD: We performed a replica search with
      descriptors and databases used in two previous reviews and updated to April 2015.
      Next, we carried out an evaluation of the efficacy, adequacy, and acceptability
      of VR-EBT protocols. RESULTS: Results showed that VR-EBT was effective in the
      treatment of PTSD. The findings related to adequacy showed that not all studies
      using VR-EBT reported having followed the clinical guidelines for evidence-based 
      interventions in the treatment of PTSD. Regarding acceptability, few studies
      evaluated this subject. However, the findings are very promising, and patients
      reported high acceptability and satisfaction with the inclusion of VR in the
      treatment of PTSD. CONCLUSION: The main weaknesses identified in this review
      focus on the need for more controlled studies, the need to standardize treatment 
      protocols using VR-EBT, and the need to include assessments of acceptability and 
      related variables. Finally, this paper highlights some directions and future
      perspectives for using VR-EBT in PTSD treatment.

TI  - Hippocampal Volume Reduction in Humans Predicts Impaired Allocentric Spatial
      Memory in Virtual-Reality Navigation.
PG  - 14123-31
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0801-15.2015 [doi]
AB  - The extent to which navigational spatial memory depends on hippocampal integrity 
      in humans is not well documented. We investigated allocentric spatial recall
      using a virtual environment in a group of patients with severe hippocampal damage
      (SHD), a group of patients with "moderate" hippocampal damage (MHD), and a normal
      control group. Through four learning blocks with feedback, participants learned
      the target locations of four different objects in a circular arena. Distal cues
      were present throughout the experiment to provide orientation. A circular
      boundary as well as an intra-arena landmark provided spatial reference frames.
      During a subsequent test phase, recall of all four objects was tested with only
      the boundary or the landmark being present. Patients with SHD were impaired in
      both phases of this task. Across groups, performance on both types of spatial
      recall was highly correlated with memory quotient (MQ), but not with intelligence
      quotient (IQ), age, or sex. However, both measures of spatial recall separated
      experimental groups beyond what would be expected based on MQ, a widely used
      measure of general memory function. Boundary-based and landmark-based spatial
      recall were both strongly related to bilateral hippocampal volumes, but not to
      volumes of the thalamus, putamen, pallidum, nucleus accumbens, or caudate
      nucleus. The results show that boundary-based and landmark-based allocentric
      spatial recall are similarly impaired in patients with SHD, that both types of
      recall are impaired beyond that predicted by MQ, and that recall deficits are
      best explained by a reduction in bilateral hippocampal volumes. SIGNIFICANCE
      STATEMENT: In humans, bilateral hippocampal atrophy can lead to profound
      impairments in episodic memory. Across species, perhaps the most well-established
      contribution of the hippocampus to memory is not to episodic memory generally but
      to allocentric spatial memory. However, the extent to which navigational spatial 
      memory depends on hippocampal integrity in humans is not well documented. We
      investigated spatial recall using a virtual environment in two groups of patients
      with hippocampal damage (moderate/severe) and a normal control group. The results
      showed that patients with severe hippocampal damage are impaired in learning and 
      recalling allocentric spatial information. Furthermore, hippocampal volume

AB  - We developed a rehabilitation system by using the virtual reality technique and
      the Kinect in this paper. The system combines rehabilitation training with HMI
      and serious game organically, and provides a game and motion database to meet
      different patients' demands. Extended interface of game database is provided in
      two ways: personalized games can be developed by Virtools and Flash games which
      are suitable for patients' rehabilitation can be download from the Internet
      directly. In addition, the system provides patients with flexible interaction and
      easy control mode, and also presents real time data recording. An objective and
      subjective evaluation method is proposed to review the effectiveness of the
      rehabilitation training. According to the results of short questionnaires and the
      evaluation results of patients' rehabilitation training, the system compared with
      traditional rehabilitation can record and analyze the training data, which is
      useful to make rehabilitation plans. More entertainment and lower cost will
      increase patients' motivation, which helps to increase the rehabilitation
      effectiveness.

AB  - The ability to imagine the world from a different viewpoint is a fundamental
      competence for spatial reorientation and for imagining what another individual
      sees in the environment. Here, we investigated the neural bases of such an
      ability using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Healthy participants
      detected target displacements across consecutive views of a familiar virtual
      room, either from the perspective of an avatar (primed condition) or in the
      absence of such a prime (unprimed condition). In the primed condition, the
      perspective at test always corresponded to the avatar's perspective, while in the
      unprimed condition it was randomly chosen as 0, 45 or 135deg of viewpoint
      rotation. We observed a behavioral advantage in performing a perspective
      transformation during the primed condition as compared to an equivalent amount of
      unprimed perspective change. Although many cortical regions (dorsal parietal,
      parieto-temporo-occipital junction, precuneus and retrosplenial
      cortex/parieto-occipital sulcus or RSC/POS) were involved in encoding and
      retrieving target location from different perspectives and were modulated by the 
      amount of viewpoint rotation, the RSC/POS was the only area showing decreased
      activity in the primed as compared to the unprimed condition, suggesting that
      this region anticipates the upcoming perspective change. The retrosplenial
      cortex/parieto-occipital sulcus appears to play a special role in the allocentric
      coding of heading directions.

TI  - Efficacy of exercise intervention programs on cognition in people suffering from 
      multiple sclerosis, stroke and Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis of current evidence.
PG  - 273-89
LID - 10.3233/NRE-151260 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is a well-established sequela of people
      suffering from neurological pathologies. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of
      exercise intervention programs on cognitive performance in participants suffering
      from stroke, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. METHODS: Four online
      databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PEDro) were comprehensively
      searched from their inception through December 2014. The search query was phrased
      as follows: In people suffering from MS, stroke or Parkinson's disease, do
      exercise intervention programs improve cognitive performance? RESULTS: Twelve
      controlled clinical trials met our inclusion criteria. Studies were classified
      according to three clinical subgroups: Parkinson's disease (n = 3), stroke (n =
      1) and multiple sclerosis (n = 8). Eight studies employed an aerobic intervention
      program; one used an active exercise program based on virtual reality systems,
      three reports examined the effect of yoga and one compared the intervention
      program with sport climbing. Significant improvements in cognition were found in 
      nine out of the twelve studies. Nevertheless, the total effect size was
      non-significant (0.18 (95% CI, - 4.1, 3.8)) for changes in executive functions.
      CONCLUSION: Due to lack of commonality between measures of cognition, training
      sequences and intervention period, it remains unclear as to whether exercise
      training can be effective in improving the cognitive functions of neurological
      patients.

AB  - Excessive self-concern increases perceptions of threat and defensiveness. In
      contrast, fostering a more inclusive and expanded sense of self can reduce stress
      and improve well-being. We developed and tested a novel brief intervention
      designed to strengthen a student's compassionate self-identity, an identity that 
      values balance and growth by reminding them of four quiet ego characteristics:
      detached awareness, inclusive identity, perspective taking, and growth. Students 
      (N = 32) in their first semester of college who reported greater self-protective 
      (e.g., defensive) goals in the first 2 weeks of the semester were invited to
      participate in the study. Volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three
      conditions: quiet ego contemplation (QEC), QEC with virtual reality (VR) headset 
      (QEC-VR), and control. Participants came to the lab three times to engage in a
      15-min exercise in a 30-days period. The 15-min QEC briefly described each quiet 
      ego characteristic followed by a few minutes time to reflect on what that
      characteristic meant to them. Those in the QEC condition reported improved quiet 
      ego characteristics and pluralistic thinking, decreases in a urinary marker of
      oxidative stress, and reduced mind-wandering on a cognitive task. Contrary to
      expectation, participants who wore the VR headsets while listening to the QEC
      demonstrated the least improvement. Results suggest that a brief intervention
      that reduces self-focus and strengthens a more compassionate self-view may offer 
      an additional resource that individuals can use in their everyday lives.

TI  - Agreement and Reliability of Pelvic Floor Measurements during Rest and maximum
      Valsalva using Three-Dimensional Translabial Ultrasound and Virtual Reality
      Imaging.
LID - 10.1002/uog.15785 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Levator ani hiatus imaging is of value in diagnosis and follow-up in 
      patients with pelvic organ prolapse.This study compares levator ani hiatus volume
      measurements during rest and maximum Valsalva obtained with conventional
      three-dimensional (3D) translabial ultrasound and virtual reality imaging.
      Furthermore, it establishes their agreement and reliability and their relation
      with prolapse symptoms and Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) stage.
      METHODS: One hundred women with an intact levator ani were selected. Clinical
      symptoms were obtained using standardized questionnaires. Ultrasound datasets
      were analyzed using a rendered volume with a slice thickness of 1.5 cm at the
      level of minimal hiatal dimension during rest and maximum Valsalva. The levator
      area (in cm2 ) was measured and multiplied by 1.5 to get the levator ani hiatus
      volume in conventional 3D ultrasound (in cm3 ). Levator ani hiatus volume
      measurements were measured semi-automatically in virtual reality (cm3 ) using a
      segmentation algorithm. Twenty patients were randomly chosen to analyse intra-
      and interobserver agreement. RESULTS: The mean difference between levator hiatus 
      volume measurements using conventional 3D ultrasound compared to virtual reality 
      in rest was 1.52 cm3 (95% CI 1.00- 2.04) and during maximum Valsalva 1.16 cm3
      (95% CI 0.56-1.76) (p<0.001). Intraobserver and interobserver intraclass
      correlation coefficients for conventional 3D ultrasound were >/= 0.96 and for
      virtual reality >0.99. Patients with prolapse symptoms and pelvic organ prolapse 
      did have significant larger hiatal measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Levator hiatus
      volume measurements during rest and maximum Valsalva are significantly smaller
      using virtual reality compared to conventional 3D ultrasound; however this
      difference seems not clinically important.

TI  - Face and content validity of a virtual-reality simulator for myringotomy with
      tube placement.
PG  - 40
LID - 10.1186/s40463-015-0094-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myringotomy with tube insertion can be challenging for junior
      Otolaryngology residents as it is one of the first microscopic procedures they
      encounter. The Western myringotomy simulator was developed to allow trainees to
      practice microscope positioning, myringotomy, and tube placement. This
      virtual-reality simulator is viewed in stereoscopic 3D, and a haptic device is
      used to manipulate the digital ear model and surgical tools. OBJECTIVE: To assess
      the face and content validity of the Western myringotomy simulator. METHODS: The 
      myringotomy simulator was integrated with new modules to allow speculum
      placement, manipulation of an operative microscope, and insertion of the
      ventilation tube through a deformable tympanic membrane. A questionnaire was
      developed in consultation with instructing surgeons. Fourteen face validity
      questions focused on the anatomy of the ear, simulation of the operative
      microscope, appearance and movement of the surgical instruments, deformation and 
      cutting of the eardrum, and myringotomy tube insertion. Six content validity
      questions focused on training potential on surgical tasks such as speculum
      placement, microscope positioning, tool navigation, ear anatomy, myringotomy
      creation and tube insertion. A total of 12 participants from the Department of
      Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery were recruited for the study. Prior to
      completing the questionnaire, participants were oriented to the simulator and
      given unlimited time to practice until they were comfortable with all of its
      aspects. RESULTS: Responses to 12 of the 14 questions on face validity were
      predominantly positive. One issue of concern was with contact modeling related to
      tube insertion into the eardrum, and the second was with the movement of the
      blade and forceps. The former could be resolved by using a higher resolution
      digital model for the eardrum to improve contact localization. The latter could
      be resolved by using a higher fidelity haptic device. With regard to content
      validity, 64% of the responses were positive, 21% were neutral, and 15% were
      negative. CONCLUSIONS: The Western myringotomy simulator appears to have
      sufficient face and content validity. Further development with automated metrics 
      and skills transference testing is planned.

TI  - Cognitive Load in Mastoidectomy Skills Training: Virtual Reality Simulation and
      Traditional Dissection Compared.
LID - S1931-7204(15)00232-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jsurg.2015.09.010 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The cognitive load (CL) theoretical framework suggests that working
      memory is limited, which has implications for learning and skills acquisition.
      Complex learning situations such as surgical skills training can potentially
      induce a cognitive overload, inhibiting learning. This study aims to compare CL
      in traditional cadaveric dissection training and virtual reality (VR) simulation 
      training of mastoidectomy. DESIGN: A prospective, crossover study. Participants
      performed cadaveric dissection before VR simulation of the procedure or vice
      versa. CL was estimated by secondary-task reaction time testing at baseline and
      during the procedure in both training modalities. SETTING: The national Danish
      temporal bone course. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 40 novice otorhinolaryngology
      residents. RESULTS: Reaction time was increased by 20% in VR simulation training 
      and 55% in cadaveric dissection training of mastoidectomy compared with baseline 
      measurements. Traditional dissection training increased CL significantly more
      than VR simulation training (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: VR simulation training
      imposed a lower CL than traditional cadaveric dissection training of
      mastoidectomy. Learning complex surgical skills can be a challenge for the novice
      and mastoidectomy skills training could potentially be optimized by employing VR 
      simulation training first because of the lower CL. Traditional dissection
      training could then be used to supplement skills training after basic
      competencies have been acquired in the VR simulation.

TI  - The potential of virtual reality-based training to enhance the functional
      autonomy of Alzheimer's disease patients in cooking activities: A single case
      study.
PG  - 1-25
AB  - Impairments in performing activities of daily living occur early in the course of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is a great need to develop non-pharmacological
      therapeutic interventions likely to reduce dependency in everyday activities in
      AD patients. This study investigated whether it was possible to increase autonomy
      in these patients in cooking activities using interventions based on errorless
      learning, vanishing-cue, and virtual reality techniques. We recruited a
      79-year-old woman who met NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. She was trained 
      in four cooking tasks for four days per task, one hour per day, in virtual and in
      real conditions. Outcome measures included subjective data concerning the
      therapeutic intervention and the experience of virtual reality, repeated
      assessments of training activities, neuropsychological scores, and self-esteem
      and quality of life measures. The results indicated that our patient could
      relearn some cooking activities using virtual reality techniques. Transfer to
      real life was also observed. Improvement of the task performance remained stable 
      over time. This case report supports the value of a non-immersive virtual kitchen
      to help people with AD to relearn cooking activities.

AB  - Child pedestrian injuries are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity across
      the United States and the world. Repeated practice at the cognitive-perceptual
      task of crossing a street may lead to safer pedestrian behavior. Virtual reality 
      offers a unique opportunity for repeated practice without the risk of actual
      injury. This study conducted a pre-post within-subjects trial of training
      children in pedestrian safety using a semi-mobile, semi-immersive virtual
      pedestrian environment placed at schools and community centers. Pedestrian safety
      skills among a group of 44 seven- and eight-year-old children were assessed in a 
      laboratory, and then children completed six 15-minute training sessions in the
      virtual pedestrian environment at their school or community center following
      pragmatic trial strategies over the course of three weeks. Following training,
      pedestrian safety skills were re-assessed. Results indicate improvement in delay 
      entering traffic following training. Safe crossings did not demonstrate change.
      Attention to traffic and time to contact with oncoming vehicles both decreased
      somewhat, perhaps an indication that training was incomplete and children were in
      the process of actively learning to be safer pedestrians. The findings suggest
      virtual reality environments placed in community centers hold promise for
      teaching children to be safer pedestrians, but future research is needed to
      determine the optimal training dosage.

AB  - It remains a mystery why the growth rate of bacteria is higher in low-dose
      ionizing radiation (LDIR) environment than that in normal environment. In this
      study, a hypothesis composed of environmental selection and competitive exclusion
      was firstly proposed from observed phenomena, experimental data and microbial
      ecology. Then a LDIR environment simulator (LDIRES) was built to cultivate a
      model organism of bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli) DH5alpha, the accurate
      response of bacterial population to ionizing radiation intensity variation was
      measured experimentally, and then the precise relative dosage of ionizing
      radiation E. coli DH5alpha population received was calculated by finite element
      analysis based on drift-diffusion equations of plasma. Finally, a highly valid
      mathematical model expressing the relationship between E. coli DH5alpha
      population and LDIR intensity was developed by system dynamics based on
      hypotheses, experimental data and microbial ecology. Both experiment and
      simulation results clearly showed that the E. coli DH5alpha individuals with
      greater specific growth rate and lower substrate consumption coefficient would
      adapt and survive in LDIR environment and those without such adaptability were
      finally eliminated under the combined effects of ionizing radiation selection and
      competitive exclusion.

TI  - Towards immersive virtual reality (iVR): a route to surgical expertise.
LID - 2 [pii]
AB  - Surgery is characterized by complex tasks performed in stressful environments. To
      enhance patient safety and reduce errors, surgeons must be trained in
      environments that mimic the actual clinical setting. Rasmussen's model of human
      behavior indicates that errors in surgical procedures may be skill-, rule-, or
      knowledge-based. While skill-based behavior and some rule-based behavior may be
      taught using box trainers and ex vivo or in vivo animal models, we posit that
      multimodal immersive virtual reality (iVR) that includes high-fidelity visual as 
      well as other sensory feedback in a seamless fashion provides the only means of
      achieving true surgical expertise by addressing all three levels of human
      behavior. While the field of virtual reality is not new, realization of the goals
      of complete immersion is challenging and has been recognized as a Grand Challenge
      by the National Academy of Engineering. Recent technological advances in both
      interface and computational hardware have generated significant enthusiasm in
      this field. In this paper, we discuss convergence of some of these technologies
      and possible evolution of the field in the near term.

AB  - Preliminary evidence suggests beneficial effects of transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) on anxiety. The objective of this study was to investigate the 
      effects of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) as a form of TMS on acute 
      anxiety provoked by a virtual reality (VR) scenario. Participants with spider
      phobia (n=41) and healthy controls (n=42) were exposed to a spider scenario in VR
      after one session of iTBS over the prefrontal cortex or sham treatment.
      Participants with spider phobia reacted with more anxiety compared to healthy
      controls. Their heart rate and skin conductance increased compared to baseline.
      Contrary to expectations, iTBS did not influence these reactions, but modulated
      heart rate variability (HRV). Sympathetic influence on HRV showed an increase in 
      the active iTBS group only. This study does not support the idea of beneficial
      effects of a single session of iTBS on anxiety, although other protocols or
      repeated sessions might be effective.

TI  - Indocyanine Green Fluorescence for Free-Flap Perfusion Imaging Revisited:
      Advanced Decision Making by Virtual Perfusion Reality in Visionsense Fusion
      Imaging Angiography.
LID - 1553350615610651 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Near-infrared indocyanine green video angiography (ICG-NIR-VA) has
      been introduced for free-flap surgery and may provide intraoperative flap
      designing as well as postoperative monitoring. Nevertheless, the technique has
      not been established in clinical routine because of controversy over benefits.
      Improved technical features of the novel Visionsense ICG-NIR-VA surgery system
      are promising to revisit the field of application. It features a unique real-time
      fusion image of simultaneous NIR and white light visualization, with highlighted 
      perfusion, including a color-coded perfusion flow scale for optimized anatomical 
      understanding. METHODS: In a feasibility study, the Visionsense ICG-NIR-VA system
      was applied during 10 free-flap surgeries in 8 patients at our center.
      Indications included anterior lateral thigh (ALT) flap (n = 4), latissimus dorsi 
      muscle flap (n = 1), tensor fascia latae flap (n = 1), and two bilateral deep
      inferior epigastric artery perforator flaps (n = 4). The system was used
      intraoperatively and postoperatively to investigate its impact on surgical
      decision making and to observe perfusion patterns correlated to clinical
      monitoring. RESULTS: Visionsense ICG-NIR-VA aided assessing free-flap design and 
      perfusion patterns in all cases and correlated with clinical observations.
      Additional interventions were performed in 2 cases (22%). One venous anastomosis 
      was revised, and 1 flap was redesigned. Indicated by ICG-NIR-VA, 1 ALT flap
      developed partial flap necrosis (11%). CONCLUSIONS: The Visionsense ICG-NIR-VA
      system allowed a virtual view of flap perfusion anatomy by fusion imaging in
      real-time. The system improved decision making for flap design and surgical
      decisions. Clinical and ICG-NIR-VA parameters correlated. Its future
      implementation may aid in improving outcomes for free-flap surgery, but
      additional experience is needed to define its final role.

TI  - Developing a Novel Measure of Body Satisfaction Using Virtual Reality.
PG  - e0140158
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0140158 [doi]
AB  - Body image disturbance (BID), considered a key feature in eating disorders, is a 
      pervasive issue among young women. Accurate assessment of BID is critical, but
      the field is currently limited to self-report assessment methods. In the present 
      study, we build upon existing research, and explore the utility of virtual
      reality (VR) to elicit and detect changes in BID across various immersive virtual
      environments. College-aged women with elevated weight and shape concerns (n = 38)
      and a non-weight and shape concerned control group (n = 40) were randomly exposed
      to four distinct virtual environments with high or low levels of body salience
      and social presence (i.e., presence of virtual others). Participants interacted
      with avatars of thin, normal weight, and overweight body size (BMI of
      approximately 18, 22, and 27 respectively) in virtual social settings (i.e.,
      beach, party). We measured state-level body satisfaction (state BD) immediately
      after exposure to each environment. In addition, we measured participants'
      minimum interpersonal distance, visual attention, and approach preference toward 
      avatars of each size. Women with higher baseline BID reported significantly
      higher state BD in all settings compared to controls. Both groups reported
      significantly higher state BD in a beach with avatars as compared to other
      environments. In addition, women with elevated BID approached closer to normal
      weight avatars and looked longer at thin avatars compared to women in the control
      group. Our findings indicate that VR may serve as a novel tool for measuring
      state-level BID, with applications for measuring treatment outcomes. Implications
      for future research and clinical interventions are discussed.

TI  - Client perceptions of the mental health engagement network: a qualitative
      analysis of an electronic personal health record.
PG  - 250
LID - 10.1186/s12888-015-0614-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information technologies such as websites, mobile phone applications,
      and virtual reality programs have been shown to deliver innovative and effective 
      treatments for mental illness. Much of the research studying electronic mental
      health interventions focuses on symptom reduction; however, to facilitate the
      implementation of electronic interventions in usual mental health care, it is
      also important to investigate the perceptions of clients who will be using the
      technologies. To this end, a qualitative analysis of focus group discussions
      regarding the Mental Health Engagement Network, a web-based personal health
      record and smartphone intervention, is presented here. METHODS: Individuals
      living in the community with a mood or psychotic disorder (n = 394) were provided
      with a smartphone and access to an electronic personal health record, the Lawson 
      SMART Record, for 12 to 18 months to manage their mental health. This study
      employed a delayed-implementation design and obtained both quantitative and
      qualitative data through individual interviews and focus group sessions.
      Participants had the opportunity to participate in voluntary focus group sessions
      at three points throughout the study to discuss their perceptions of the
      technologies. Qualitative data from 95 focus group participants were analysed
      using a thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four overarching themes emerged from focus
      group discussions: 1) Versatile functionality of the Lawson SMART Record and
      smartphone facilitated use; 2) Aspects of the technologies as barriers to use; 3)
      Use of the Mental health Engagement Network technologies resulted in perceived
      positive outcomes; 4) Future enhancement of the Lawson SMART Record and
      intervention is recommended. DISCUSSION: These qualitative data provide a
      valuable contribution to the understanding of how smarttechnologies can be
      integrated into usual mental health care. Smartphones are extremely portable
      andcommonplace in society. Therefore, clients can use these devices to manage and
      track mental health issuesin any place at almost any time without feeling
      stigmatized. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing clients' perspectives regarding the use of
      smart technologies in mental health care provides an invaluable addition to the
      current literature. Qualitative findings support the feasibility of implementing 
      a smartphone and electronic personal health record intervention with individuals 
      who are living in the community and experiencing a mental illness, and provide
      considerations for future development and implementation.

TI  - [Risk awareness and training for prevention of complications in minimally
      invasive surgery].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive surgery (MIC) requires surgeons to have a
      different set of skills and capabilities from that of open surgery. The indirect 
      camera view, lack of a three-dimensional view, restricted haptic feedback with
      lack of tissue feeling and difficult instrument coordination with fulcrum and
      pivoting effects result in an additional learning curve compared to open surgery.
      The prolonged learning curve leads to a higher risk of complications and special 
      awareness of these risks is therefore mandatory. Training of special laparoscopic
      skills outside the operating room is needed to optimize patient outcome and to
      minimize the ocurrence of complications related to the learning curve. RESULTS
      AND DISCUSSION: Training modalities for laparoscopic surgery include simple box
      trainers, computer simulation with virtual reality, the use of artificial and
      cadaver organs, as well as live animal models and cadaver training. These
      training modalities have been proven in studies to have a beneficial effect on
      the learning curve for acquisition of laparoscopic skills and for improving
      operative performance as well as avoidance of complications. Laparoscopic
      training is currently gaining a more and more important role for official
      education and accreditation purposes. In some countries the participation in
      laparoscopic training courses has become mandatory prior to participation in
      laparoscopic operations. Future research will include the optimization of
      multimodal training curricula, the development of individualized training
      approaches that allow both trainee and patient-specific preparation, as well as
      the use of novel devices to facilitate the collection and transfer of expertise
      between the generations and schools of surgeons.

      Palsy Using Super Pop VR Evaluation Metrics: A Feasibility Study.
PG  - 812348
LID - 10.1155/2015/812348 [doi]
AB  - Objective. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether Super Pop VR,
      a low-cost virtual reality (VR) system, was a feasible system for documenting
      improvement in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and whether a home-based VR
      intervention was effective. Methods. Three children with CP participated in this 
      study and received an 8-week VR intervention (30 minutes x 5 sessions/week) using
      the commercial EyeToy Play VR system. Reaching kinematics measured by Super Pop
      VR and two fine motor tools (Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency second
      edition, BOT-2, and Pediatric Motor Activity Log, PMAL) were tested before, mid, 
      and after intervention. Results. All children successfully completed the
      evaluations using the Super Pop VR system at home where 85% of the reaches
      collected were used to compute reaching kinematics, which is compatible with
      literature using expensive motion analysis systems. Only the child with
      hemiplegic CP and more impaired arm function improved the reaching kinematics and
      functional use of the affected hand after intervention. Conclusion. Super Pop VR 
      proved to be a feasible evaluation tool in children with CP.

TI  - The effectiveness of using non-traditional teaching methods to prepare student
      health care professionals for the delivery of mental state examination: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 177-212
LID - 10.11124/jbisrir-2015-2263 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the evolution of education, there has been a shift from the use 
      of traditional teaching methods, such as didactic or rote teaching, towards
      non-traditional teaching methods, such as viewing of role plays, simulation, live
      interviews and the use of virtual environments. Mental state examination is an
      essential competency for all student healthcare professionals. If mental state
      examination is not taught in the most effective manner so learners can comprehend
      its concepts and interpret the findings correctly, it could lead to serious
      repercussions and subsequently impact on clinical care provided for patients with
      mental health conditions, such as incorrect assessment of suicidal ideation.
      However, the methods for teaching mental state examination vary widely between
      countries, academic institutions and clinical settings. OBJECTIVES: This
      systematic review aimed to identify and synthesize the best available evidence of
      effective teaching methods used to prepare student health care professionals for 
      the delivery of mental state examination. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review
      considered evidence from primary quantitative studies which address the
      effectiveness of a chosen method used for the teaching of mental state
      examination published in English, including studies that measure learner
      outcomes, i.e. improved knowledge and skills, self-confidence and learners'
      satisfaction. SEARCH STRATEGY: A three-step search strategy was undertaken in
      this review to search for articles published in English from the inception of the
      database to December 2014. An initial search of MEDLINE and CINAHL was undertaken
      to identify keywords. Secondly, the keywords identified were used to search
      electronic databases, namely, CINAHL, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials, Ovid, PsycINFO and, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses. Thirdly, 
      reference lists of the articles identified in the second stage were searched for 
      other relevant studies. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Studies selected were assessed by
      two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the
      review using the standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna
      Briggs Institute's Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument
      embedded within the System for the Unified Management, Assessment and Review of
      Information. Any disagreements that arose between the reviewers were resolved
      through discussion between the reviewers. DATA EXTRACTION: Data was extracted
      using data extraction tools developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute Quantitative
      data was extracted from papers using standardized data extraction tools from the 
      Joanna Briggs Institute's Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review
      Instrument. DATA SYNTHESIS: The included studies were found to be heterogeneous
      in terms of participants and teaching methods. Moreover, a wide variety of
      instruments were used to determine impact and outcomes of the teaching methods.
      Hence, findings of the included articles were presented in a narrative summary.
      RESULTS: A total of 12 articles were included in this review with consensus from 
      all reviewers. The evidence retrieved in this study suggests that non-traditional
      teaching methods, such as videotapes, virtual simulation, standardized patients
      and reflection, improve learners' understanding and skills of mental state
      examination as opposed to traditional teaching methods like lectures and
      provision of reading materials. However, studies that specifically compared the
      effectiveness of one method over another TRUNCATED AT 500 WORDS.

TI  - The Use of Virtual Reality in the Production of Cue-Specific Craving for
      Cigarettes: A Meta-Analysis.
LID - ntv216 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The cue-reactivity procedure has demonstrated that smokers respond 
      with increases in subjective craving in the presence of smoking-related cues.
      Virtual reality is an emerging mode of cue presentation for cue-reactivity
      research. Despite the successful implementation of virtual reality during the
      last decade, no systematic review has investigated the magnitude of effects
      across studies. METHODS: This research systematically reviewed findings from
      studies using virtual reality in cigarette craving assessment. Eligible studies
      assessed subjective craving for cigarettes in smokers exposed to smoking-related 
      and neutral environments. Cohen's d was used to assess differences in craving
      between smoking-related and nonsmoking-related virtual environments. A random
      effects approach was used to combine effect sizes. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies
      involving 541 smokers was included in the final analyses. Environments with
      smoking-related cues produced significant increases in craving relative to
      environments without smoking-related cues. The mean overall effect size (Cohen's 
      d) was 1.041 (SE = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.81 to 1.28, Z = 8.68, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS:
      The meta-analysis suggested that presentations of smoking cues through virtual
      reality can produce strong increases in craving among cigarette smokers. This
      strong cue-reactivity effect, which was comparable in magnitude to the craving
      effect sizes found with more conventional modes of cue presentation, supports the
      use of virtual reality for the generation of robust cue-specific craving in
      cue-reactivity research.

TI  - A review of simulation platforms in surgery of the temporal bone.
LID - 10.1111/coa.12560 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgery of the temporal bone is a high-risk activity in an
      anatomically complex area. Simulation enables rehearsal of such surgery. The
      traditional simulation platform is the cadaveric temporal bone, but in recent
      years other simulation platforms have been created, including plastic and virtual
      reality platforms. OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: To undertake a review of simulation
      platforms for temporal bone surgery, specifically assessing their educational
      value in terms of validity and in enabling transition to surgery. TYPE OF REVIEW:
      Systematic qualitative review. SEARCH STRATEGY: Search of the Pubmed, CINAHL, BEI
      and ERIC databases. EVALUATION METHOD: Assessment of reported outcomes in terms
      of educational value. RESULTS: 49 articles were included, covering cadaveric,
      animal, plastic, and virtual simulation platforms. Cadaveric simulation is highly
      rated as an educational tool, but there may be a ceiling effect on educational
      outcomes after drilling 8-10 temporal bones. Animal models show significant
      anatomical variation from man. Plastic temporal bone models offer much potential,
      but at present lack sufficient anatomical or haptic validity. Similarly, virtual 
      reality platforms lack sufficient anatomical or haptic validity, but with
      technological improvements they are advancing rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: At present
      cadaveric simulation remains the best platform for training in temporal bone
      surgery. Technological advances enabling improved materials or modelling mean
      that in the future plastic or virtual platforms may become comparable to
      cadaveric platforms, and also offer additional functionality including
      patient-specific simulation from CT data. This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - The effect of self-directed virtual reality simulation on dissection training
      performance in mastoidectomy.
LID - 10.1002/lary.25710 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To establish the effect of self-directed virtual reality
      (VR) simulation training on cadaveric dissection training performance in
      mastoidectomy and the transferability of skills acquired in VR simulation
      training to the cadaveric dissection training setting. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective 
      study. METHODS: Two cohorts of 20 novice otorhinolaryngology residents received
      either self-directed VR simulation training before cadaveric dissection training 
      or vice versa. Cadaveric and VR simulation performances were assessed using
      final-product analysis with three blinded expert raters. RESULTS: The group
      receiving VR simulation training before cadaveric dissection had a mean
      final-product score of 14.9 (95 % confidence interval [CI] [12.9-16.9]) compared 
      with 9.8 (95% CI [8.4-11.1]) in the group not receiving VR simulation training
      before cadaveric dissection. This 52% increase in performance was statistically
      significantly (P < 0.0001). A single dissection mastoidectomy did not increase VR
      simulation performance (P = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Two hours of self-directed VR
      simulation training was effective in increasing cadaveric dissection
      mastoidectomy performance and suggests that mastoidectomy skills are transferable
      from VR simulation to the traditional dissection setting. Virtual reality
      simulation training can therefore be employed to optimize training, and can spare
      the use of donated material and instructional resources for more advanced
      training after basic competencies have been acquired in the VR simulation
      environment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA. Laryngoscope, 2015.

AB  - We present a first-draft digital reconstruction of the microcircuitry of
      somatosensory cortex of juvenile rat. The reconstruction uses cellular and
      synaptic organizing principles to algorithmically reconstruct detailed anatomy
      and physiology from sparse experimental data. An objective anatomical method
      defines a neocortical volume of 0.29 +/- 0.01 mm(3) containing approximately
      31,000 neurons, and patch-clamp studies identify 55 layer-specific morphological 
      and 207 morpho-electrical neuron subtypes. When digitally reconstructed neurons
      are positioned in the volume and synapse formation is restricted to biological
      bouton densities and numbers of synapses per connection, their overlapping arbors
      form approximately 8 million connections with approximately 37 million synapses. 
      Simulations reproduce an array of in vitro and in vivo experiments without
      parameter tuning. Additionally, we find a spectrum of network states with a sharp
      transition from synchronous to asynchronous activity, modulated by physiological 
      mechanisms. The spectrum of network states, dynamically reconfigured around this 
      transition, supports diverse information processing strategies. PAPERCLIP: VIDEO

TI  - Visual re-identification of individual objects: a core problem for organisms and 
      AI.
AB  - Two open questions about the visual re-identification of individual objects over 
      extended time periods are briefly reviewed: (1) How much a priori information
      about the nature of objects, identity and time is required to support robust
      individual object re-identification abilities? and (2) how do epistemic feelings,
      such as the feeling of familiarity, contribute both to object re-identification
      and to the perception of opportunities and risks associated with individual
      objects and their affordances? The ongoing interplay between experiments that can
      be carried out with human subjects and experiments made possible with robotic
      systems is examined. It is suggested that developmental robotics, including
      virtual-reality simulations of robot-environment interactions, may provide the
      best route to understanding both the implementation of epistemic feelings in
      humans and their functional contribution to the identification of persistent
      individual objects.

      Images.
PG  - e0140230
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0140230 [doi]
AB  - We examine depth perception in images of real scenes with naturalistic variation 
      in pictorial depth cues, simulated dioptric blur and binocular disparity. Light
      field photographs of natural scenes were taken with a Lytro plenoptic camera that
      simultaneously captures images at up to 12 focal planes. When accommodation at
      any given plane was simulated, the corresponding defocus blur at other depth
      planes was extracted from the stack of focal plane images. Depth information from
      pictorial cues, relative blur and stereoscopic disparity was separately
      introduced into the images. In 2AFC tasks, observers were required to indicate
      which of two patches extracted from these images was farther. Depth
      discrimination sensitivity was highest when geometric and stereoscopic disparity 
      cues were both present. Blur cues impaired sensitivity by reducing the contrast
      of geometric information at high spatial frequencies. While simulated generic
      blur may not assist depth perception, it remains possible that dioptric blur from
      the optics of an observer's own eyes may be used to recover depth information on 
      an individual basis. The implications of our findings for virtual reality
      rendering technology are discussed.

TI  - Exergaming as a Viable Therapeutic Tool to Improve Static and Dynamic Balance
      among Older Adults and People with Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic
      Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 167
LID - 10.3389/fnagi.2015.00167 [doi]
AB  - The use of virtual reality games (known as "exergaming") as a neurorehabilitation
      tool is gaining interest. Therefore, we aim to collate evidence for the effects
      of exergaming on the balance and postural control of older adults and people with
      idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). Six electronic databases were searched,
      from inception to April 2015, to identify relevant studies. Standardized mean
      differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to calculate
      effect sizes between experimental and control groups. I (2) statistics were used 
      to determine levels of heterogeneity. 325 older adults and 56 people with IPD who
      were assessed across 11 -studies. The results showed that exergaming improved
      static balance (SMD 1.069, 95% CI 0.563-1.576), postural control (SMD 0.826, 95% 
      CI 0.481-1.170), and dynamic balance (SMD -0.808, 95% CI -1.192 to -0.424) in
      healthy older adults. Two IPD studies showed an improvement in static balance
      (SMD 0.124, 95% CI -0.581 to 0.828) and postural control (SMD 2.576, 95% CI
      1.534-3.599). Our findings suggest that exergaming might be an appropriate
      therapeutic tool for improving balance and postural control in older adults, but 
      more -large-scale trials are needed to determine if the same is true for people
      with IPD.

      accommodation and convergence cues.
PG  - 511
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00511 [doi]
AB  - In our daily life experience, the angular size of an object correlates with its
      distance from the observer, provided that the physical size of the object remains
      constant. In this work, we investigated depth perception in action space (i.e.,
      beyond the arm reach), while keeping the angular size of the target object
      constant. This was achieved by increasing the physical size of the target object 
      as its distance to the observer increased. To the best of our knowledge, this is 
      the first time that a similar protocol has been tested in action space, for
      distances to the observer ranging from 1.4-2.4 m. We replicated the task in
      virtual and real environments and we found that the performance was significantly
      different between the two environments. In the real environment, all participants
      perceived the depth of the target object precisely. Whereas, in virtual reality
      (VR) the responses were significantly less precise, although, still above chance 
      level in 16 of the 20 observers. The difference in the discriminability of the
      stimuli was likely due to different contributions of the convergence and the
      accommodation cues in the two environments. The values of Weber fractions
      estimated in our study were compared to those reported in previous studies in
      peripersonal and action space.

LID - 10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00254 [doi]
AB  - The current study investigated whether gradually reducing the frequency of
      aversive stimuli during extinction can prevent the return of fear. Thirty-one
      participants of a three-stage procedure (acquisition, extinction and a
      reinstatement test on day 2) were randomly assigned to a standard extinction (SE)
      and gradual extinction (GE) procedure. The two groups differed only in the
      extinction procedure. While the SE group ran through a regular extinction process
      without any negative events, the frequency of the aversive stimuli during the
      extinction phase was gradually reduced for the GE group. The unconditioned
      stimulus (US) was an air blast (5 bar, 10 ms). A spider and a scorpion were used 
      as conditioned stimuli (CS). The outcome variables were contingency ratings and
      physiological measures (skin conductance response, SCR and startle response).
      There were no differences found between the two groups for the acquisition and
      extinction phases concerning contingency ratings, SCR, or startle response. GE
      compared to SE significantly reduced the return of fear in the reinstatement test
      for the startle response but not for SCR or contingency ratings. This study was
      successful in translating the findings in rodent to humans. The results suggest
      that the GE process is suitable for increasing the efficacy of fear extinction.

TI  - Semi-Parametric Color Reproduction Method for Optical See-Through Head-Mounted
      Displays.
PG  - 1269-78
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2459892 [doi]
AB  - The fundamental issues in Augmented Reality (AR) are on how to naturally mediate 
      the reality with virtual content as seen by users. In AR applications with
      Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Displays (OST-HMD), the issues often raise the
      problem of rendering color on the OST-HMD consistently to input colors. However, 
      due to various display constraints and eye properties, it is still a challenging 
      task to indistinguishably reproduce the colors on OST-HMDs. An approach to solve 
      this problem is to pre-process the input color so that a user perceives the
      output color on the display to be the same as the input. We propose a color
      calibration method for OST-HMDs. We start from modeling the physical optics in
      the rendering and perception process between the HMD and the eye. We treat the
      color distortion as a semi-parametric model which separates the non-linear color 
      distortion and the linear color shift. We demonstrate that calibrated images
      regain their original appearance on two OST-HMD setups with both synthetic and
      real datasets. Furthermore, we analyze the limitations of the proposed method and
      remaining problems of the color reproduction in OST-HMDs. We then discuss how to 
      realize more practical color reproduction methods for future HMD-eye system.

AB  - The goal of this experiment was to examine whether a conditioned place preference
      could be established in humans using a secondary reinforcer that provided little 
      obvious reward to the participants. Two experiments were conducted to answer this
      question. In Experiment 1, 244 undergraduates were placed into a VR environment
      consisting of two visually distinct rooms connected by a door. Throughout the
      experiment, one room was randomly paired with occasional point rewards while the 
      other unique room was never paired with rewards. Participants received thee
      pairings in each room. After a short break, a test session was administered, and 
      participants were given free access to the entire VR environment and no point
      rewards were administered. On the test day, we observe that participants
      displayed a significant CPP for the room paired with points, as evidenced by
      significant differences in rating each of the rooms in terms of enjoyment. In
      Experiment 2, 77 undergraduates were tested using a biased conditioning approach 
      in which an initial test session was conducted to obtain the participant's
      preferred room bias, and then the least-preferred room was designated as the
      points reward room for each participant. Using this biased conditioning approach,
      participants spent a significantly greater amount of time in the points-paired
      room. In this case, participants showed preferences based on explicit and
      implicit measures. These results suggest new approaches to examine the role of
      secondary reinforcers in nontraditional addictions such as internet, gaming, and 
      gambling dependencies.

TI  - The role of simulation in neurosurgery.
AB  - PURPOSE: In an era of residency duty-hour restrictions, there has been a recent
      effort to implement simulation-based training methods in neurosurgery teaching
      institutions. Several surgical simulators have been developed, ranging from
      physical models to sophisticated virtual reality systems. To date, there is a
      paucity of information describing the clinical benefits of existing simulators
      and the assessment strategies to help implement them into neurosurgical
      curricula. Here, we present a systematic review of the current models of
      simulation and discuss the state-of-the-art and future directions for simulation 
      in neurosurgery. METHODS: Retrospective literature review. RESULTS: Multiple
      simulators have been developed for neurosurgical training, including those for
      minimally invasive procedures, vascular, skull base, pediatric, tumor resection, 
      functional neurosurgery, and spine surgery. The pros and cons of existing systems
      are reviewed. CONCLUSION: Advances in imaging and computer technology have led to
      the development of different simulation models to complement traditional surgical
      training. Sophisticated virtual reality (VR) simulators with haptic feedback and 
      impressive imaging technology have provided novel options for training in
      neurosurgery. Breakthrough training simulation using 3D printing technology holds
      promise for future simulation practice, proving high-fidelity patient-specific
      models to complement residency surgical learning.

TI  - Projections from neocortex mediate top-down control of memory retrieval.
PG  - 653-9
LID - 10.1038/nature15389 [doi]
AB  - Top-down prefrontal cortex inputs to the hippocampus have been hypothesized to be
      important in memory consolidation, retrieval, and the pathophysiology of major
      psychiatric diseases; however, no such direct projections have been identified
      and functionally described. Here we report the discovery of a monosynaptic
      prefrontal cortex (predominantly anterior cingulate) to hippocampus (CA3 to CA1
      region) projection in mice, and find that optogenetic manipulation of this
      projection (here termed AC-CA) is capable of eliciting contextual memory
      retrieval. To explore the network mechanisms of this process, we developed and
      applied tools to observe cellular-resolution neural activity in the hippocampus
      while stimulating AC-CA projections during memory retrieval in mice behaving in
      virtual-reality environments. Using this approach, we found that learning drives 
      the emergence of a sparse class of neurons in CA2/CA3 that are highly correlated 
      with the local network and that lead synchronous population activity events;
      these neurons are then preferentially recruited by the AC-CA projection during
      memory retrieval. These findings reveal a sparsely implemented memory retrieval
      mechanism in the hippocampus that operates via direct top-down prefrontal input, 
      with implications for the patterning and storage of salient memory
      representations.

LID - 10.1016/j.eururo.2015.09.021 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: No single large published randomized controlled trial (RCT) has
      confirmed the efficacy of virtual simulators in the acquisition of skills to the 
      standard required for safe clinical robotic surgery. This remains the main
      obstacle for the adoption of these virtual simulators in surgical residency
      curricula. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the level of evidence in published studies on
      the efficacy of training on virtual simulators for robotic surgery. EVIDENCE
      ACQUISITION: In April 2015 a literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of
      Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, the Clinical Trials Database (US) and the Meta
      Register of Controlled Trials. All publications were scrutinized for relevance to
      the review and for assessment of the levels of evidence provided using the
      classification developed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.
      EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The publications included in the review consisted of one RCT 
      and 28 cohort studies on validity, and seven RCTs and two cohort studies on
      skills transfer from virtual simulators to robot-assisted surgery. Simulators
      were rated good for realism (face validity) and for usefulness as a training tool
      (content validity). However, the studies included used various simulation
      training methodologies, limiting the assessment of construct validity. The review
      confirms the absence of any consensus on which tasks and metrics are the most
      effective for the da Vinci Skills Simulator and dV-Trainer, the most widely
      investigated systems. Although there is consensus for the RoSS simulator, this is
      based on only two studies on construct validity involving four exercises. One
      study on initial evaluation of an augmented reality module for partial
      nephrectomy using the dV-Trainer reported high correlation (r=0.8) between in
      vivo porcine nephrectomy and a virtual renorrhaphy task according to the overall 
      Global Evaluation Assessment of Robotic Surgery (GEARS) score. In one RCT on
      skills transfer, the experimental group outperformed the control group, with a
      significant difference in overall GEARS score (p=0.012) during performance of
      urethrovesical anastomosis on an inanimate model. Only one study included
      assessment of a surgical procedure on real patients: subjects trained on a
      virtual simulator outperformed the control group following traditional training. 
      However, besides the small numbers, this study was not randomized. CONCLUSIONS:
      There is an urgent need for a large, well-designed, preferably multicenter RCT to
      study the efficacy of virtual simulation for acquisition competence in and safe
      execution of clinical robotic-assisted surgery. PATIENT SUMMARY: We reviewed the 
      literature on virtual simulators for robot-assisted surgery. Validity studies
      used various simulation training methodologies. It is not clear which exercises
      and metrics are the most effective in distinguishing different levels of
      experience on the da Vinci robot. There is no reported evidence of skills
      transfer from simulation to clinical surgery on real patients.

TI  - Virtual Reality-Enhanced Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Morbid Obesity: A
      Randomized Controlled Study with 1 Year Follow-Up.
AB  - It is well known that obesity has a multifactorial etiology, including
      biological, environmental, and psychological causes. For this reason, obesity
      treatment requires a more integrated approach than the standard behavioral
      treatment based on dietary and physical activity only. To test the long-term
      efficacy of an enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) of obesity, including 
      a virtual reality (VR) module aimed at both unlocking the negative memory of the 
      body and to modify its behavioral and emotional correlates, 163 female morbidly
      obese inpatients (body mass index >40) were randomly assigned to three
      conditions: a standard behavioral inpatient program (SBP), SBP plus standard CBT,
      and SBP plus VR-enhanced CBT. Patients' weight, eating behavior, and body
      dissatisfaction were measured at the start and upon completion of the inpatient
      program. Weight was assessed also at 1 year follow-up. All measures improved
      significantly at discharge from the inpatient program, and no significant
      difference was found among the conditions. However, odds ratios showed that
      patients in the VR condition had a greater probability of maintaining or
      improving weight loss at 1 year follow-up than SBP patients had (48% vs. 11%, p =
      0.004) and, to a lesser extent, than CBT patients had (48% vs. 29%, p = 0.08).
      Indeed, only the VR-enhanced CBT was effective in further improving weight loss
      at 1 year follow-up. On the contrary, participants who received only the
      inpatient program regained back, on average, most of the weight they had lost.
      Findings support the hypothesis that a VR module addressing the locked negative
      memory of the body may enhance the long-term efficacy of standard CBT.

      Wheelchair for Pediatric Powered Mobility Training.
PG  - 183-92
LID - 10.1080/10400435.2015.1012607 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with severe disabilities are sometimes unable to access
      powered mobility training. Thus, we developed the Kinect-Wheelchair Interface
      Controlled (KWIC) smart wheelchair trainer that converts a manual wheelchair into
      a powered wheelchair. The KWIC Trainer uses computer vision to create a virtual
      tether with adaptive shared-control between the wheelchair and a therapist during
      training. It also includes a mixed-reality video game system. METHODS: We
      performed a year-long usability study of the KWIC Trainer at a local clinic,
      soliciting qualitative and quantitative feedback on the device after extended
      use. RESULTS: Eight therapists used the KWIC Trainer for over 50 hours with 8
      different children. Two of the children obtained their own powered wheelchair as 
      a result of the training. The therapists indicated the device allowed them to
      provide mobility training for more children than would have been possible with a 
      demo wheelchair, and they found use of the device to be as safe as or safer than 
      conventional training. They viewed the shared control algorithm as
      counter-productive because it made it difficult for the child to discern when he 
      or she was controlling the chair. They were enthusiastic about the video game
      integration for increasing motivation and engagement during training. They
      emphasized the need for additional access methods for controlling the device.
      CONCLUSION: The therapists confirmed that the KWIC Trainer is a useful tool for
      increasing access to powered mobility training and for engaging children during
      training sessions. However, some improvements would enhance its applicability for
      routine clinical use.

TI  - Need for simulation in laparoscopic colorectal surgery training.
PG  - 185-9
LID - 10.4240/wjgs.v7.i9.185 [doi]
AB  - The dissemination of laparoscopic colorectal surgery (LCS) has been slow despite 
      increasing evidence for the clinical benefits, with a prolonged learning curve
      being one of the main restrictions for a prompt uptake. Performing advanced
      laparoscopic procedures requires dedicated surgical skills and new simulation
      methods designed precisely for LCS have been established: These include virtual
      reality simulators, box trainers, animal and human tissue and synthetic
      materials. Studies have even demonstrated an improvement in trainees'
      laparoscopic skills in the actual operating room and a staged approach to
      surgical simulation with a combination of various training methods should be
      mandatory in every colorectal training program. The learning curve for LCS could 
      be reduced through practice and skills development in a riskfree setting.

AB  - Thumb-to-finger tap interaction can be employed to perform eyes-free, discrete,
      symbolic input in virtual and augmented reality environments. The DigiTap device 
      is worn on the wrist to keep the hand free from any instrumentation so as not to 
      impair tactile sense and dexterity. DigiTap senses the jerk that is caused by a
      tap and takes an image sequence to detect the tap location. The device can
      recognize taps at 12 different locations on the fingers, and at some positions,
      it can even distinguish between different tap strengths. The authors conducted an
      extended user study to evaluate users' abilities to interact with the device and 
      perform symbolic input.

AB  - Shape displays are an emerging class of devices that emphasize actuation to
      enable rich physical interaction, complementing concepts in virtual and augmented
      reality. The ability to render form introduces new opportunities to touch, grasp,
      and manipulate dynamic physical content and tangible objects, in both nearby and 
      remote environments. This article presents novel hardware, interaction
      techniques, and applications, which point to the potential for extending the ways
      that we traditionally interact with the physical world, empowered by digital
      computation.

TI  - The body fades away: investigating the effects of transparency of an embodied
      virtual body on pain threshold and body ownership.
PG  - 13948
LID - 10.1038/srep13948 [doi]
AB  - The feeling of "ownership" over an external dummy/virtual body (or body part) has
      been proven to have both physiological and behavioural consequences. For
      instance, the vision of an "embodied" dummy or virtual body can modulate pain
      perception. However, the impact of partial or total invisibility of the body on
      physiology and behaviour has been hardly explored since it presents obvious
      difficulties in the real world. In this study we explored how body transparency
      affects both body ownership and pain threshold. By means of virtual reality, we
      presented healthy participants with a virtual co-located body with four different
      levels of transparency, while participants were tested for pain threshold by
      increasing ramps of heat stimulation. We found that the strength of the body
      ownership illusion decreases when the body gets more transparent. Nevertheless,
      in the conditions where the body was semi-transparent, higher levels of ownership
      over a see-through body resulted in an increased pain sensitivity. Virtual body
      ownership can be used for the development of pain management interventions.
      However, we demonstrate that providing invisibility of the body does not increase
      pain threshold. Therefore, body transparency is not a good strategy to decrease
      pain in clinical contexts, yet this remains to be tested.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review to
      determine the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) training in orthopaedic
      surgery. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic review was performed of articles of 
      VR training in orthopaedic surgery published up to November 2014 from MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases.
      RESULTS: We included 10 relevant trials of 91 identified articles, which all
      reported on training in arthroscopic surgery (shoulder, n = 5; knee, n = 4;
      undefined, n = 1). A total of 303 participants were involved. Assessment after
      training was made on a simulator in 9 of the 10 studies, and in one study it took
      place in the operating room (OR) on a real patient. A total of 32 different
      outcomes were extracted; 29 of them were about skills assessment. None involved a
      patient-related outcome. One study focused on anatomic learning, and the other
      evaluated technical task performance before and after training on a VR simulator.
      Five studies established construct validity. Three studies reported a
      statistically significant improvement in technical skills after training on a VR 
      simulator. CONCLUSIONS: VR training leads to an improvement of technical skills
      in orthopaedic surgery. Before its widespread use, additional trials are needed
      to clarify the transfer of VR training to the OR. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Systematic
      review of Level I through Level IV studies.

TI  - Changes of pelvis control with subacute stroke: A comparison of body-weight-
      support treadmill training coupled virtual reality system and over-ground
      training.
PG  - S355-64
LID - 10.3233/THC-150972 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gait recovery is very important to stroke survivors to regain their
      independence in activity of daily life. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to
      investigate the effects of virtual reality (VR) coupled body weight support
      treadmill training (BWSTT) on pelvic control at the early stage of stroke.
      METHODS: Kinematic and kinetic changes of pelvic motion were evaluated by a 3D
      gait analysis system and were compared to the results from over-ground walking
      training. Twenty-four patients having unilateral hemiplegia with subacute stroke 
      were recruited to a VR coupled BWSTT group (n= 12) and a conventional therapy
      (CT) group (n= 12). Both of the groups received training of 20-40 min/day, 5
      days/week, for 3 weeks. RESULTS: The results showed the tilt of pelvis in
      sagittal plane improved significantly (P= 0.038) after treatment in the BWSTT+VR 
      group, in terms of decreased amplitude of anterior peak (mean, from 10.99 degrees
      to 6.25 degrees ), while there were no significant differences in the control
      group. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that VR coupled BWSTT gait training
      could decrease anterior tilt of pelvis in early hemiparetic persons following a
      modest intervention dose, and the training may have advantages over conventional 
      over-ground gait training and can assist the therapists in correcting abnormal
      gait pattern of stroke survivors.

      study.
PG  - 581-9
LID - 10.3233/THC-151014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Research on virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET)
      has demonstrated good treatment efficacy with regards to several anxiety
      disorders. Yet, there is lack of knowledge about the value of integrating
      interaction between clients and virtual humans in VRET. Such interaction might
      prove effective in treating psychological complaints that involve social
      interactions, such as social anxiety. METHODS: A VRET system specifically
      designed to expose clients with social anxiety disorder to anxiety provoking
      social situations was applied to 16 and 18 individuals with high and low levels
      of social anxiety, respectively. Participants engaged in two exposure sessions in
      several free speech dialogues with virtual humans while being monitored by a
      therapist. RESULTS: Participants with high levels of social anxiety reported
      significantly lower levels of social anxiety three months after exposure to two
      virtual reality interaction sessions than before treatment (p < 0.01). In the
      group with low levels of social anxiety, no significant change of social anxiety 
      was reported between pre-treatment and follow-up. Additionally, participants in
      both groups reported higher self-efficacy three months after treatment than
      before treatment (ps </= 0.001). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that virtual
      reality technology that incorporates social interactions may be successfully
      applied for therapeutic purposes.

TI  - Development of a novel haptic glove for improving finger dexterity in poststroke 
      rehabilitation.
AB  - Almost all stroke patients experience a certain degree of fine motor impairment, 
      and impeded finger movement may limit activities in daily life. Thus, to improve 
      the quality of life of stroke patients, designing an efficient training device
      for fine motor rehabilitation is crucial. This study aimed to develop a novel
      fine motor training glove that integrates a virtual-reality based interactive
      environment with vibrotactile feedback for more effective post stroke hand
      rehabilitation. The proposed haptic rehabilitation device is equipped with small 
      DC vibration motors for vibrotactile feedback stimulation and piezoresistive
      thin-film force sensors for motor function evaluation. Two virtual-reality based 
      games ``gopher hitting'' and ``musical note hitting'' were developed as a haptic 
      interface. According to the designed rehabilitation program, patients intuitively
      push and practice their fingers to improve the finger isolation function.
      Preliminary tests were conducted to assess the feasibility of the developed
      haptic rehabilitation system and to identify design concerns regarding the
      practical use in future clinical testing.

TI  - Using a virtual reality game to assess goal-directed hand movements in children: 
      A pilot feasibility study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality gaming environments may be used as a supplement to
      the motor performance assessment tool box by providing clinicians with
      quantitative information regarding motor performance in terms of movement
      accuracy and speed, as well as sensory motor integration under different levels
      of dual tasking. OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of using the virtual
      reality game `Timocco' as an assessment tool for evaluating goal-directed hand
      movements among typically developing children. METHODS: In this pilot study, 47
      typically-developing children were divided into two age groups, 4-6 years old and
      6-8 years old. Performance was measured using two different virtual environment
      games (Bubble Bath and Falling Fruit), each with two levels of difficulty.
      Discriminative validity (age effect) was examined by comparing the performance of
      the two groups, and by comparing the performance between levels of the games for 
      each group (level effect). Test-retest reliability was examined by reassessing
      the older children 3-7 days after the first session. RESULTS: The older children 
      performed significantly better in terms of response time, action time, game
      duration, and efficiency in both games compared to the younger children. Both age
      groups demonstrated poorer performance at the higher game level in the Bubble
      Bath game compared to the lower level. A similar level effect was found in the
      Falling Fruit game for both age groups in response time and efficiency, but not
      in action time. The performance of the older children was not significantly
      different between the two sessions at both game levels. CONCLUSIONS: The
      discriminative validity and test-retest reliability indicate the feasibility of
      using the Timocco virtual reality game as a tool for assessing goal-directed hand
      movements in children. Further studies should examine its feasibility for use in 
      children with disabilities.

TI  - Assessing Unilateral Spatial Neglect using advanced technologies: The
      potentiality of mobile virtual reality.
PG  - 795-807
LID - 10.3233/THC-151039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unilateral Spatial Neglect, or neglect, is a common behavioral
      syndrome in patients following unilateral brain damage, such as stroke. In recent
      years, new technologies, such as computer-based tools and virtual reality have
      been used in order to solve some limitations of the traditional neglect
      evaluation. Within this perspective, also mobile devices such as tablets seems to
      be promising tools, being able to support interactive virtual environments and,
      at the same time, allowing to easily reproduce traditional paper-and-pencil test.
      OBJECTIVE: In this context, the aim of our study was to investigate the
      potentiality of a new mobile application (Neglect App) designed and developed for
      tablet (iPad) for screening neglect symptoms. METHODS: To address this objective,
      we divided a sample of 16 right-damaged patients according to the presence or
      absence of neglect and we administered assessment test in their traditional and
      Neglect App version. RESULTS: Results showed that the cancellation tests
      developed within Neglect App were equally effective to traditional
      paper-and-pencil tests (Line cancellation test and Star Cancellation test) in
      detecting neglect symptoms. Secondly, according to our results, the Neglect App
      Card Dealing task was more sensitive in detecting neglect symptoms than
      traditional functional task. CONCLUSIONS: Globally, results gives preliminary
      evidences supporting the feasibility of Neglect App for the screening of USN
      symptoms.

TI  - Face, Content, and Construct Validity of Brain Tumor Microsurgery Simulation
      Using a Human Placenta Model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain tumors are complex 3-dimensional lesions. Their resection
      involves training and the use of the multiple microsurgical techniques available 
      for removal. Simulation models, with haptic and visual realism, may be useful for
      improving the bimanual technical skills of neurosurgical residents and
      neurosurgeons, potentially decreasing surgical errors and thus improving patient 
      outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe and assess an ex vivo placental model for brain 
      tumor microsurgery using a simulation tool in neurosurgical psychomotor teaching 
      and assessment. METHODS: Sixteen human placentas were used in this research
      project. Intravascular blood remnants were removed by continuous saline solution 
      irrigation of the 2 placental arteries and placental vein. Brain tumors were
      simulated using silicone injections in the placental stroma. Eight neurosurgeons 
      and 8 neurosurgical residents carried out the resection of simulated tumors using
      the same surgical instruments and bimanual microsurgical techniques used to
      perform human brain tumor operations. Face and content validity was assessed
      using a subjective evaluation based on a 5-point Likert scale. Construct validity
      was assessed by analyzing the surgical performance of the neurosurgeon and
      resident groups. RESULTS: The placenta model simulated brain tumor surgical
      procedures with high fidelity. Results showed face and content validity.
      Construct validity was demonstrated by statistically different surgical
      performances among the evaluated groups. CONCLUSION: Human placentas are useful
      haptic models to simulate brain tumor microsurgical removal. Results using this
      model demonstrate face, content, and construct validity. ABBREVIATION: VR,
      virtual reality.

TI  - Preliminary evaluation of a virtual reality dental simulation system on drilling 
      operation.
PG  - S747-56
LID - 10.3233/BME-151366 [doi]
AB  - To evaluate the fidelity of the iDental system and investigate its utility and
      performance on simulated drilling operations, user studies consisting of
      objective and subjective evaluations were performed. A voxel-based drilling
      simulation sub-system in the iDental system was employed for evaluation. Twenty
      participants were enrolled to take part in the experiments and were divided into 
      two groups: novice and resident. A combined evaluation method including objective
      and subjective methods was employed. The objective evaluation included two dental
      drilling tasks: caries removal operation and pulp chamber opening operation. In
      the subjective method, participants were required to complete a questionnaire to 
      evaluate the fidelity of the system after the operation task. Based on the
      structured global assessment scales in the questionnaire, the average subjective 
      evaluation scores of the proposed metrics were greater than 4.5, demonstrating
      that the system operated above medium fidelity. Dentists expressed great interest
      and positive attitudes toward the potential of the iDental system. The objective 
      evaluation data including time spent and the volume of removed healthy and
      carious tissue were obtained. Although no significant differences could be found 
      between the two groups, the volume of removed caries and the depth of pulp
      chamber insertion manifested small standard deviations. Evaluation results
      illustrated that dentists were willing to use the virtual reality training
      system. Several future research topics were identified, including increasing the 
      task difficulty, improving the system fidelity and introducing appropriate finger
      rest points.

TI  - Influential factors for pressure pulse waveform in healthy young adults.
PG  - S497-505
LID - 10.3233/BME-151339 [doi]
AB  - The effects of gender and other contributory factors on pulse waveform are still 
      under arguments. In view of different results caused by few considerations of
      possible influential factors and general agreement of gender relating to pulse
      waveform, this study aims to address the confounding factors interfering with the
      association between gender and pulse waveform characteristics. A novel method was
      proposed to noninvasively detect pressure pulse wave and assess the morphology of
      pulse wave. Forty healthy young subjects were included in the present research.
      Height, weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
      were measured manually and body mass index (BMI), pulse blood pressure (PP) and
      heart rate (HR) were calculated automatically. Student's t test was used to
      analyze the gender difference and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine the
      effects of intrinsic factors. Univariate regression analysis was performed to
      assess the main factors on the waveform characteristics. Waveform features were
      found significantly different between genders. However this study indicates that 
      the main factors for time-related and amplitude-related parameters are HR and SBP
      respectively. In conclusion, the impact of HR and SBP on pulse waveform features 
      should not be underestimated, especially when analyzing the gender difference.

TI  - EEG functional network properties related to visually induced unrecognized
      spatial disorientation.
PG  - S1115-24
LID - 10.3233/BME-151408 [doi]
AB  - Unrecognized spatial disorientation (SD) which is intimately linked with brain
      cognitive function is always a fatal issue for the safety of pilots. To explore
      its effects on human brain cognitive functions, electroencephalography (EEG)
      functional network analysis methods were adopted to examine topological changes
      in the connection of cognitive regions when experiencing unrecognized SD. Twelve 
      male pilots participated in the study. They were subjected to a SD scene, namely 
      visual rotation, which evoked unrecognized SD. For the main EEG frequency
      intervals, the phase lag index (PLI) and normalized mutual information (NMI) were
      calculated to quantify the EEG data. Then weighted connectivity networks were
      constructed and their properties were characterized in terms of an average
      clustering coefficient and global efficiency. A T-test was performed to compare
      PLI, NMI and network measures under unrecognized SD and non-SD conditions. It
      indicated a weak functional connectivity level in the theta band under
      unrecognized SD based on the significant decrease of mean values of PLI and NMI
      (p<0.05). Meanwhile, both the average clustering coefficient and global
      efficiency in the theta band reduced under the unrecognized SD condition. The
      decrease of the average clustering coefficient and global efficiency demonstrates
      a lack of small-world characteristics and a decline in processing efficiency of
      brain cognitive regions. All the experimental results show that unrecognized SD
      may have a negative effect on brain functional networks in the theta band.

TI  - Leveraging Two Kinect Sensors for Accurate Full-Body Motion Capture.
PG  - 24297-317
LID - 10.3390/s150924297 [doi]
AB  - Accurate motion capture plays an important role in sports analysis, the medical
      field and virtual reality. Current methods for motion capture often suffer from
      occlusions, which limits the accuracy of their pose estimation. In this paper, we
      propose a complete system to measure the pose parameters of the human body
      accurately. Different from previous monocular depth camera systems, we leverage
      two Kinect sensors to acquire more information about human movements, which
      ensures that we can still get an accurate estimation even when significant
      occlusion occurs. Because human motion is temporally constant, we adopt a
      learning analysis to mine the temporal information across the posture variations.
      Using this information, we estimate human pose parameters accurately, regardless 
      of rapid movement. Our experimental results show that our system can perform an
      accurate pose estimation of the human body with the constraint of information
      from the temporal domain.

      comparison to matched controls, using the virtual classroom (VC); (2) to assess
      the utility of the VC in detecting attention deficits in children with ABI, as
      compared to classical neuropsychological tests and questionnaire-based assessment
      of attention; and (3) to determine how performance in the VC is affected by
      demographic and injury severity variables. METHODS: Forty-one children with ABI
      and 35 age- and gender-matched controls, aged 8-16, were assessed with the VC.
      The results of the VC were compared to sub-tests of the Test of Everyday
      Attention for Children (TEA-Ch), the Conners' Parent Rating Scales-Revised: Short
      (CPRS-R:S) questionnaire and analysed according to demographic and injury
      severity variables. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between the
      groups regarding the number of targets correctly identified in the VC.
      Significant inter-correlations were obtained between the VC variables.
      Significant correlations were found between the VC variables, the sub-tests of
      TEA-Ch and the CPRS-R:S and the demographic characteristics of the sample.
      CONCLUSION: The VC appears to be a sensitive and ecologically valid assessment
      tool for use in the diagnosis of attention deficits among children with ABI.

TI  - Virtual Reality Exposure Training for Musicians: Its Effect on Performance
      Anxiety and Quality.
PG  - 169-77
AB  - Music performance anxiety affects numerous musicians, with many of them reporting
      impairment of performance due to this problem. This exploratory study
      investigated the effects of virtual reality exposure training on students with
      music performance anxiety. Seventeen music students were randomly assigned to a
      control group (n=8) or a virtual training group (n=9). Participants were asked to
      play a musical piece by memory in two separate recitals within a 3-week interval.
      Anxiety was then measured with the Personal Report of Confidence as a Performer
      Scale and the S-Anxiety scale from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y).
      Between pre- and post-tests, the virtual training group took part in virtual
      reality exposure training consisting of six 1-hour long sessions of virtual
      exposure. The results indicate a significant decrease in performance anxiety for 
      musicians in the treatment group for those with a high level of state anxiety,
      for those with a high level of trait anxiety, for women, and for musicians with
      high immersive tendencies. Finally, between the pre- and post-tests, we observed 
      a significant increase in performance quality for the experimental group, but not
      for the control group.

AB  - Among the most important innovations within the psychotherapeutic care system are
      the new opportunities in the field of e-mental health. During the past decade,
      Internet-based and other e-mental health approaches for the treatment of
      post-traumatic stress disorder and related stress-associated symptoms have been
      developed in great variety. Solely Internet-based self-help programs are the
      lowest-threshold approaches in a stepped-care system. By contrast, individualized
      online psychotherapy and virtual reality programs are at the opposite pole of the
      spectrum. Approaches in the field of m(obile)-mental health complement these new 
      developments in psychotherapy. The existing evidence supports the clinical
      efficacy of all the described approaches, although not all have been tested
      rigorously analog to phase III studies in psychopharmacology. Nonetheless,
      e-mental health approaches will shape our field more and more in the future.

TI  - Dual Motor-Cognitive Virtual Reality Training Impacts Dual-Task Performance in
      Freezing of Gait.
PG  - 1855-61
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2015.2479625 [doi]
AB  - Freezing of gait (FOG), an episodic gait disturbance characterized by the
      inability to generate effective stepping, occurs in more than half of Parkinson's
      disease patients. It is associated with both executive dysfunction and attention 
      and becomes most evident during dual tasking (performing two tasks
      simultaneously). This study examined the effect of dual motor-cognitive virtual
      reality training on dual-task performance in FOG. Twenty community dwelling
      participants with Parkinson's disease (13 with FOG, 7 without FOG) participated
      in a pre-assessment, eight 20-minute intervention sessions, and a
      post-assessment. The intervention consisted of a virtual reality maze (DFKI,
      Germany) through which participants navigated by stepping-in-place on a balance
      board (Nintendo, Japan) under time pressure. This was combined with a cognitive
      task (Stroop test), which repeatedly divided participants' attention. The primary
      outcome measures were pre- and post-intervention differences in motor (stepping
      time, symmetry, rhythmicity) and cognitive (accuracy, reaction time) performance 
      during single- and dual-tasks. Both assessments consisted of 1) a single
      cognitive task 2) a single motor task, and 3) a dual motor-cognitive task.
      Following the intervention, there was significant improvement in dual-task
      cognitive and motor parameters (stepping time and rhythmicity), dual-task effect 
      for those with FOG and a noteworthy improvement in FOG episodes. These
      improvements were less significant for those without FOG. This is the first study
      to show benefit of a dual motor-cognitive approach on dual-task performance in
      FOG. Advances in such virtual reality interventions for home use could
      substantially improve the quality of life for patients who experience FOG.

PG  - 1377-89
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2480060 [doi]
AB  - When human actors interact with virtual objects the result is often not
      convincing to a third party viewer, due to incongruities between the actor and
      object positions. In this study we aim to quantify the magnitude and impact of
      the errors that occur in a bimanual interaction, that is when an actor attempts
      to move a virtual object by holding it between both hands. A three stage
      framework is presented which firstly captures the magnitude of these interaction 
      errors, then quantifies their effect on the relevant third party audience, and
      thirdly assesses methods to mitigate the impact of the errors. Findings from this
      work show that the degree of error was dependent on the size of the virtual
      object and also on the axis of the hand placement with respect to the axis of the
      interactive motion. In addition, actor hand placement outside and away from the
      object surface was found to affect the visual plausibility considerably more than
      when the actor's hands were within the object boundaries. Finally, a method for
      automatic adaptation of the object size to match the distance between the actor's
      hands gave a significant improvement in the viewers' assessment of the scene
      plausibility.

TI  - Modelling Ecological Cognitive Rehabilitation Therapies for Building Virtual
      Environments in Brain Injury.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain Injury (BI) has become one of the most common causes of
      neurological disability in developed countries. Cognitive disorders result in a
      loss of independence and patients' quality of life. Cognitive rehabilitation aims
      to promote patients' skills to achieve their highest degree of personal autonomy.
      New technologies such as virtual reality or interactive video allow developing
      rehabilitation therapies based on reproducible Activities of Daily Living (ADLs),
      increasing the ecological validity of the therapy. However, the lack of
      frameworks to formalize and represent the definition of this kind of therapies
      can be a barrier for widespread use of interactive virtual environments in
      clinical routine. OBJECTIVES: To provide neuropsychologists with a methodology
      and an instrument to design and evaluate cognitive rehabilitation therapeutic
      interventions strategies based on ADLs performed in interactive virtual
      environments. METHODS: The proposed methodology is used to model therapeutic
      interventions during virtual ADLs considering cognitive deficit, expected
      abnormal interactions and therapeutic hypotheses. It allows identifying abnormal 
      behavioural patterns and designing interventions strategies in order to achieve
      errorless-based rehabilitation. RESULTS: An ADL case study ('buying bread') is
      defined according to the guidelines established by the ADL intervention model.
      This case study is developed, as a proof of principle, using interactive video
      technology and is used to assess the feasibility of the proposed methodology in
      the definition of therapeutic intervention procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed 
      methodology provides neuropsychologists with an instrument to design and evaluate
      ADL-based therapeutic intervention strategies, attending to solve actual
      limitation of virtual scenarios, to be use for ecological rehabilitation of
      cognitive deficit in daily clinical practice. The developed case study proves the
      potential of the methodology to design therapeutic interventions strategies;
      however our current work is devoted to designing more experiments in order to
      present more evidence about its values.

PG  - 1091-6
LID - 10.1017/S0022215115002364 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality surgical simulation of mastoidectomy is a promising
      training tool for novices. Final-product analysis for assessing novice
      mastoidectomy performance could be limited by a peak or ceiling effect. These may
      be countered by simulator-integrated tutoring. METHODS: Twenty-two participants
      completed a single session of self-directed practice of the mastoidectomy
      procedure in a virtual reality simulator. Participants were randomised for
      additional simulator-integrated tutoring. Performances were assessed at 10-minute
      intervals using final-product analysis. RESULTS: In all, 45.5 per cent of
      participants peaked before the 60-minute time limit. None of the participants
      achieved the maximum score, suggesting a ceiling effect. The tutored group
      performed better than the non-tutored group but tutoring did not eliminate the
      peak or ceiling effects. CONCLUSION: Timing and adequate instruction is important
      when using final-product analysis to assess novice mastoidectomy performance.
      Improved real-time feedback and tutoring could address the limitations of final
      product based assessment.

TI  - A Cognitive and Virtual Reality Treatment Program for the Fear of Flying.
PG  - 723-7
LID - 10.3357/AMHP.4211.2015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Passenger air transport has considerably increased in the past 50 yr.
      It is estimated that between 7 and 40% of the population of industrialized
      countries is currently afraid of flying. Programs treating the fear of flying
      have been developed to meet this problem. This study measures the effectiveness
      of one of these programs by focusing on flight-related anxiety before the program
      and after the first flight following the intervention. METHODS: There were 157
      individuals recruited to participate in a 1-d intervention aiming at treating the
      fear of flying, and using both cognitive behavioral techniques and virtual
      reality. Anxiety was measured with the Flight Anxiety Situations (FAS) and the
      Flight Anxiety Modality (FAM) questionnaires. RESULTS: Statistical analyses were 
      conducted on 145 subjects (69.7% female; ages from 14 to 64) after the exclusion 
      of individuals with missing data. The results showed a decrease in flight-related
      anxiety for each subscale of the two questionnaires: the somatic (d=2.44) and
      cognitive anxiety (d=1.47) subscales of the FAM, and the general flight anxiety
      (d=3.20), the anticipatory flight anxiety (d=1.74), and the in-flight anxiety
      (d=1.04) subscales of the FAS. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of the treatment
      program using both cognitive behavioral techniques and virtual reality strategies
      for fear of flying reduced flight-related anxiety in the subjects in our study.
      Our results show that subjects demonstrated lower anxiety levels after the first 
      flight following the program than before the intervention.

AB  - Near body distance is a key component of action and social interaction. Recent
      research has shown that peripersonal space (reachability-distance for acting with
      objects) and interpersonal space (comfort-distance for interacting with people)
      share common mechanisms and reflect the social valence of stimuli. The social
      psychological literature has demonstrated that information about morality is
      crucial because it affects impression formation and the intention to
      approach-avoid others. Here we explore whether peripersonal/interpersonal spaces 
      are modulated by moral information. Thirty-six participants interacted with
      male/female virtual confederates described by moral/immoral/neutral sentences.
      The modulation of body space was measured by reachability-distance and
      comfort-distance while participants stood still or walked toward virtual
      confederates. Results showed that distance expanded with immorally described
      confederates and contracted with morally described confederates. This pattern was
      present in both spaces, although it was stronger in comfort-distance. Consistent 
      with an embodied cognition approach, the findings suggest that high-level
      socio-cognitive processes are linked to sensorimotor-spatial processes.

TI  - Multifunctional Setup for Studying Human Motor Control Using Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation, Electromyography, Motion Capture, and Virtual Reality.
LID - 10.3791/52906 [doi]
AB  - The study of neuromuscular control of movement in humans is accomplished with
      numerous technologies. Non-invasive methods for investigating neuromuscular
      function include transcranial magnetic stimulation, electromyography, and
      three-dimensional motion capture. The advent of readily available and
      cost-effective virtual reality solutions has expanded the capabilities of
      researchers in recreating "real-world" environments and movements in a laboratory
      setting. Naturalistic movement analysis will not only garner a greater
      understanding of motor control in healthy individuals, but also permit the design
      of experiments and rehabilitation strategies that target specific motor
      impairments (e.g. stroke). The combined use of these tools will lead to
      increasingly deeper understanding of neural mechanisms of motor control. A key
      requirement when combining these data acquisition systems is fine temporal
      correspondence between the various data streams. This protocol describes a
      multifunctional system's overall connectivity, intersystem signaling, and the
      temporal synchronization of recorded data. Synchronization of the component
      systems is primarily accomplished through the use of a customizable circuit,
      readily made with off the shelf components and minimal electronics assembly
      skills.

AB  - After experiencing a stroke in the right hemisphere, almost 50% of patients
      showed Unilateral Spatial Neglect (USN). In recent decades, Virtual Reality (VR) 
      has been used as an effective tool both for the assessment and rehabilitation of 
      USN. Indeed, this advanced technology allows post-stroke patients to interact
      with ecological and engaging environments similar to real ones, but in a safe and
      controlled way. To provide an overview of the most recent VR applications for the
      assessment and rehabilitation of USN, a systematic review has been carried out.
      Since 2010, 13 studies have proposed and tested innovative VR tools for USN.
      After a wide description of the selected studies, we discuss the main features of
      these VR tools in order to provide crucial indications for future studies,
      neurorehabilitation interventions, and clinical practice.

TI  - Future Directions: How Virtual Reality Can Further Improve the Assessment and
      Treatment of Eating Disorders and Obesity.
AB  - Transdisciplinary efforts for further elucidating the etiology of eating and
      weight disorders and improving the effectiveness of the available evidence-based 
      interventions are imperative at this time. Recent studies indicate that
      computer-generated graphic environments-virtual reality (VR)-can integrate and
      extend existing treatments for eating and weight disorders (EWDs). Future
      possibilities for VR to improve actual approaches include its use for altering in
      real time the experience of the body (embodiment) and as a cue exposure tool for 
      reducing food craving.

TI  - "What Are You Thinking When You Look at Me?" A Pilot Study of the Use of Virtual 
      Reality in Body Image.
AB  - Body image disturbance (BID) is implicated in the etiology, maintenance, and
      relapse of the eating disorders, and remains challenging to treat. New paradigms 
      such as virtual reality (VR) may offer an ecologically viable method to assess
      and treat BID. This pilot study aimed to determine if a VR environment could
      elicit increased BID in a nonclinical group of women who were dieting due to body
      image concerns or nonclinical women who were not dieting. Forty-one nonclinical
      females participated in the VR paradigm (a London Bus Journey), completing pre
      and post measures of body image satisfaction, and social evaluative concerns.
      Results did not support the hypothesis that the virtual London Bus would elicit
      increased BID. However, dieters reported significantly higher levels of social
      evaluative concerns and comparison to avatars during the virtual environment
      compared with nondieters. Participants reported acceptable levels of sense of
      presence and enjoyment of the VR environment. Possible explanations for the
      failure of the VR environment to trigger increased BID are discussed, including
      choice of environment and avatar fidelity. In conclusion, this pilot study
      suggests that VR might have potential in the treatment of disturbed body image,
      while highlighting the need for further research into the required levels of
      representational and behavioral fidelity of virtual environments and avatars.

AB  - Immersive virtual environment (IVE) technology offers a wide range of potential
      benefits to research focused on understanding how individuals perceive and
      respond to built and natural environments. In an effort to broaden awareness and 
      use of IVE technology in perception, preference and behavior research, this
      review paper describes how IVE technology can be used to complement more
      traditional methods commonly applied in public health research. The paper also
      describes a relatively simple workflow for creating and displaying 360 degrees
      virtual environments of built and natural settings and presents two
      freely-available and customizable applications that scientists from a variety of 
      disciplines, including public health, can use to advance their research into
      human preferences, perceptions and behaviors related to built and natural
      settings.

AB  - Different imaging techniques can bring different information which will
      contribute to the final diagnosis and further management of the patients. Even
      from the time of Hippocrates, palpation has been used in order to detect and
      characterize a body mass. The so-called virtual palpation has now become a
      reality due to elastography, which is a recently developed technique.
      Elastography has already been proving its added value as a complementary imaging 
      method, helpful to better characterize and differentiate between benign and
      malignant masses. The current applications of elastography in lymph nodes (LNs)
      assessment by endoscopic ultrasonography will be further discussed in this paper,
      with a review of the literature and future perspectives.

      Oscillations and Mental State.
PG  - 523250
LID - 10.1155/2015/523250 [doi]
AB  - Virtual reality environments are increasingly being used to encourage individuals
      to exercise more regularly, including as part of treatment those with mental
      health or neurological disorders. The success of virtual environments likely
      depends on whether a sense of presence can be established, where participants
      become fully immersed in the virtual environment. Exposure to virtual
      environments is associated with physiological responses, including cortical
      activation changes. Whether the addition of a real exercise within a virtual
      environment alters sense of presence perception, or the accompanying
      physiological changes, is not known. In a randomized and controlled study design,
      moderate-intensity Exercise (i.e., self-paced cycling) and No-Exercise (i.e.,
      automatic propulsion) trials were performed within three levels of virtual
      environment exposure. Each trial was 5 minutes in duration and was followed by
      posttrial assessments of heart rate, perceived sense of presence, EEG, and mental
      state. Changes in psychological strain and physical state were generally mirrored
      by neural activation patterns. Furthermore, these changes indicated that exercise
      augments the demands of virtual environment exposures and this likely contributed
      to an enhanced sense of presence.

      effects on aspects of immediate response to an exercise bout. METHODS:
      Twenty-eight participants completed a 30-min treadmill run while using one of two
      randomly assigned mobile running apps: Nike + Running, a performance-monitoring
      app which theoretically induces an associative, goal-driven state, or Zombies
      Run!, an app which turns the experience of running into a virtual reality game,
      theoretically inducing dissociation from primary exercise goals. RESULTS: The two
      conditions did not differ on primary motivational state outcomes; however,
      participants reported more associative attentional focus in the
      performance-monitoring app condition compared to more dissociative focus in the
      game-based app condition. CONCLUSIONS: Game-based and performance-tracking
      running apps may not have differential effects on goal motivation during
      exercise. However, game-based apps may help recreational exercisers dissociate
      from exercise more readily. Increasing the enjoyment of an exercise bout through 
      the development of new and innovative mobile technologies is an important avenue 
      for future research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use Nintendo's Wii Fit balance board to determine the effectiveness
      of exergaming training in reducing risk and incidence of falls in older adults
      with a history of falls. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Nursing
      home for older adults. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 65 years and older (N=60).
      INTERVENTIONS: Participants who lived in a nursing home had 6 weeks of balance
      training with either Wii Fit equipment or conventional exercise. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Physiological Profile Assessment scores and incidence of falls were
      observed with subsequent intention-to-treat statistical analyses. RESULTS:
      Physiological Profile Assessment scores and incidence of falls improved
      significantly in both groups after the intervention (all P<.01), but participants
      in the Wii Fit training group showed a significantly greater improvement in both 
      outcome measures (P=.004 and P<.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In
      institutionalized older adults with a history of falls, Wii Fit balance training 
      was more effective than conventional balance training in reducing the risk and
      incidence of falls.

AB  - Rehabilitation is considered as an adjuvant to pharmacological and surgical
      treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) to maximize functional ability and
      minimize secondary complications. Originally, approaches were based on empirical 
      experience, but growing evidence suggests that exercise-dependent plasticity
      constitutes the main mechanism underlying the effects of physiotherapy. Exercise 
      increases synaptic strength and influences neurotransmission, thus potentiating
      functional circuitry in PD. In addition, exercise is a pivotal element of motor
      learning. PD patients retain a sufficient capacity of motor learning, though
      learning rates and performance are reduced in comparison to normal controls.
      Recent meta-analyses demonstrated that rehabilitation could induce short-lasting,
      but clinically important benefits, particularly for gait and balance. However,
      the interventions are largely heterogeneous (stretching, muscle strengthening,
      balance, postural exercises, occupational therapy, cueing, treadmill training),
      and there is still no consensus about the optimal approach. Innovative techniques
      have been recently proposed: virtual reality and exergaming, motor imagery and
      action observation, robot-assisted physiotherapy and non-conventional therapies
      (e.g.: dance, martial arts). The rehabilitative program for PD should be
      "goal-based" (targeted to practicing and learning specific activities in the core
      areas), but a number of practice variables (intensity, specificity, complexity)
      need to be identified and the program should tailored to the individual patients'
      characteristics.

TI  - Effects of Field of View and Visual Complexity on Virtual Reality Training
      Effectiveness for a Visual Scanning Task.
PG  - 794-807
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2403312 [doi]
AB  - Virtual reality training systems are commonly used in a variety of domains, and
      it is important to understand how the realism of a training simulation influences
      training effectiveness. We conducted a controlled experiment to test the effects 
      of display and scenario properties on training effectiveness for a visual
      scanning task in a simulated urban environment. The experiment varied the levels 
      of field of view and visual complexity during a training phase and then evaluated
      scanning performance with the simulator's highest levels of fidelity and scene
      complexity. To assess scanning performance, we measured target detection and
      adherence to a prescribed strategy. The results show that both field of view and 
      visual complexity significantly affected target detection during training; higher
      field of view led to better performance and higher visual complexity worsened
      performance. Additionally, adherence to the prescribed visual scanning strategy
      during assessment was best when the level of visual complexity during training
      matched that of the assessment conditions, providing evidence that similar visual
      complexity was important for learning the technique. The results also demonstrate
      that task performance during training was not always a sufficient measure of
      mastery of an instructed technique. That is, if learning a prescribed strategy or
      skill is the goal of a training exercise, performance in a simulation may not be 
      an appropriate indicator of effectiveness outside of training-evaluation in a
      more realistic setting may be necessary.

LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2393871 [doi]
AB  - In training assembly workers in a factory, there are often barriers such as cost 
      and lost productivity due to shutdown. The use of virtual reality (VR) training
      has the potential to reduce these costs. This research compares virtual bimanual 
      haptic training versus traditional physical training and the effectiveness for
      learning transfer. In a mixed experimental design, participants were assigned to 
      either virtual or physical training and trained by assembling a wooden burr
      puzzle as many times as possible during a twenty minute time period. After
      training, participants were tested using the physical puzzle and were retested
      again after two weeks. All participants were trained using brightly colored
      puzzle pieces. To examine the effect of color, testing involved the assembly of
      colored physical parts and natural wood colored physical pieces. Spatial ability 
      as measured using a mental rotation test, was shown to correlate with the number 
      of assemblies they were able to complete in the training. While physical training
      outperformed virtual training, after two weeks the virtually trained participants
      actually improved their test assembly times. The results suggest that the color
      of the puzzle pieces helped the virtually trained participants in remembering the
      assembly process.

TI  - Subliminal Reorientation and Repositioning in Immersive Virtual Environments
      using Saccadic Suppression.
PG  - 545-52
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2391851 [doi]
AB  - Virtual reality strives to provide a user with an experience of a simulated world
      that feels as natural as the real world. Yet, to induce this feeling, sometimes
      it becomes necessary for technical reasons to deviate from a one-to-one
      correspondence between the real and the virtual world, and to reorient or
      reposition the user's viewpoint. Ideally, users should not notice the change of
      the viewpoint to avoid breaks in perceptual continuity. Saccades, the fast eye
      movements that we make in order to switch gaze from one object to another,
      produce a visual discontinuity on the retina, but this is not perceived because
      the visual system suppresses perception during saccades. As a consequence, our
      perception fails to detect rotations of the visual scene during saccades. We
      investigated whether saccadic suppression of image displacement (SSID) can be
      used in an immersive virtual environment (VE) to unconsciously rotate and
      translate the observer's viewpoint. To do this, the scene changes have to be
      precisely time-locked to the saccade onset. We used electrooculography (EOG) for 
      eye movement tracking and assessed the performance of two modified eye movement
      classification algorithms for the challenging task of online saccade detection
      that is fast enough for SSID. We investigated the sensitivity of participants to 
      translations (forward/backward) and rotations (in the transverse plane) during
      trans-saccadic scene changes. We found that participants were unable to detect
      approximately +/-0.5m translations along the line of gaze and +/-5 degrees
      rotations in the transverse plane during saccades with an amplitude of 15 degrees
      . If the user stands still, our approach exploiting SSID thus provides the means 
      to unconsciously change the user's virtual position and/or orientation. For
      future research and applications, exploiting SSID has the potential to improve
      existing redirected walking and change blindness techniques for unlimited
      navigation through arbitrarily-sized VEs by real walking.

TI  - Cognitive Resource Demands of Redirected Walking.
PG  - 539-44
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2391864 [doi]
AB  - Redirected walking allows users to walk through a large-scale immersive virtual
      environment (IVE) while physically remaining in a reasonably small workspace.
      Therefore, manipulations are applied to virtual camera motions so that the user's
      self-motion in the virtual world differs from movements in the real world.
      Previous work found that the human perceptual system tolerates a certain amount
      of inconsistency between proprioceptive, vestibular and visual sensation in IVEs,
      and even compensates for slight discrepancies with recalibrated motor commands.
      Experiments showed that users are not able to detect an inconsistency if their
      physical path is bent with a radius of at least 22 meters during virtual
      straightforward movements. If redirected walking is applied in a smaller
      workspace, manipulations become noticeable, but users are still able to move
      through a potentially infinitely large virtual world by walking. For this
      semi-natural form of locomotion, the question arises if such manipulations impose
      cognitive demands on the user, which may compete with other tasks in IVEs for
      finite cognitive resources. In this article we present an experiment in which we 
      analyze the mutual influence between redirected walking and verbal as well as
      spatial working memory tasks using a dual-tasking method. The results show an
      influence of redirected walking on verbal as well as spatial working memory
      tasks, and we also found an effect of cognitive tasks on walking behavior. We
      discuss the implications and provide guidelines for using redirected walking in
      virtual reality laboratories.

TI  - Going Through, Going Around: A Study on Individual Avoidance of Groups.
PG  - 520-8
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2391862 [doi]
AB  - When avoiding a group, a walker has two possibilities: either he goes through it 
      or around it. Going through very dense groups or around huge ones would not seem 
      natural and could break any sense of presence in a virtual environment. This
      paper aims to enable crowd simulators to handle such situations correctly. To
      this end, we need to understand how real humans decide to go through or around
      groups. As a first hypothesis, we apply the Principle of Minimum Energy (PME) on 
      different group sizes and density. According to this principle, a walker should
      go around small and dense groups whereas he should go through large and sparse
      groups. Such principle has already been used for crowd simulation; the novelty
      here is to apply it to decide on a global avoidance strategy instead of local
      adaptations only. Our study quantifies decision thresholds. However, PME leaves
      some inconclusive situations for which the two solutions paths have similar
      energetic costs. In a second part, we propose an experiment to corroborate PME
      decisions thresholds with real observations. As controlling the factors of an
      experiment with many people is extremely hard, we propose to use Virtual Reality 
      as a new method to observe human behavior. This work represents the first crowd
      simulation algorithm component directly designed from a VR-based study. We also
      consider the role of secondary factors in inconclusive situations. We show the
      influence of the group appearance and direction of relative motion in the
      decision process. Finally, we draw some guidelines to integrate our conclusions
      to existing crowd simulators and show an example of such integration. We evaluate
      the achieved improvements.

TI  - Subjective Evaluation of a Semi-Automatic Optical See-Through Head-Mounted
      Display Calibration Technique.
PG  - 491-500
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2391856 [doi]
AB  - With the growing availability of optical see-through (OST) head-mounted displays 
      (HMDs) there is a present need for robust, uncomplicated, and automatic
      calibration methods suited for non-expert users. This work presents the results
      of a user study which both objectively and subjectively examines registration
      accuracy produced by three OST HMD calibration methods: (1) SPAAM, (2) Degraded
      SPAAM, and (3) Recycled INDICA, a recently developed semi-automatic calibration
      method. Accuracy metrics used for evaluation include subject provided quality
      values and error between perceived and absolute registration coordinates. Our
      results show all three calibration methods produce very accurate registration in 
      the horizontal direction but caused subjects to perceive the distance of virtual 
      objects to be closer than intended. Surprisingly, the semi-automatic calibration 
      method produced more accurate registration vertically and in perceived object
      distance overall. User assessed quality values were also the highest for Recycled
      INDICA, particularly when objects were shown at distance. The results of this
      study confirm that Recycled INDICA is capable of producing equal or superior
      on-screen registration compared to common OST HMD calibration methods. We also
      identify a potential hazard in using reprojection error as a quantitative
      analysis technique to predict registration accuracy. We conclude with discussing 
      the further need for examining INDICA calibration in binocular HMD systems, and
      the present possibility for creation of a closed-loop continuous calibration
      method for OST Augmented Reality.

AB  - In virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), patients are exposed to virtual
      environments that resemble feared real-life situations. The aim of the current
      study was to assess the extent to which VRET gains can be observed in real-life
      situations. We conducted a meta-analysis of clinical trials applying VRET to
      specific phobias and measuring treatment outcome by means of behavioral
      laboratory tests or recordings of behavioral activities in real-life. Data
      sources were searches of databases (Medline, PsycInfo, and Cochrane). We included
      in total 14 clinical trials on specific phobias. Results revealed that patients
      undergoing VRET did significantly better on behavioral assessments following
      treatment than before treatment, with an aggregated uncontrolled effect size of g
      = 1.23. Furthermore, patients undergoing VRET performed better on behavioral
      assessments at post-treatment than patients on wait-list (g = 1.41).
      Additionally, results of behavioral assessment at post-treatment and at follow-up
      revealed no significant differences between VRET and exposure in vivo (g = -0.09 
      and 0.53, respectively). Finally, behavioral measurement effect sizes were
      similar to those calculated from self-report measures. The findings demonstrate
      that VRET can produce significant behavior change in real-life situations and
      support its application in treating specific phobias.

TI  - Conversations between self and self as Sigmund Freud--A virtual body ownership
      paradigm for self counselling.
PG  - 13899
LID - 10.1038/srep13899 [doi]
AB  - When people see a life-sized virtual body (VB) from first person perspective in
      virtual reality they are likely to have the perceptual illusion that it is their 
      body. Additionally such virtual embodiment can lead to changes in perception,
      implicit attitudes and behaviour based on attributes of the VB. To date the
      changes that have been studied are as a result of being embodied in a body
      representative of particular social groups (e.g., children and other race). In
      our experiment participants alternately switched between a VB closely resembling 
      themselves where they described a personal problem, and a VB representing Dr
      Sigmund Freud, from which they offered themselves counselling. Here we show that 
      when the counsellor resembles Freud participants improve their mood, compared to 
      the counsellor being a self-representation. The improvement was greater when the 
      Freud VB moved synchronously with the participant, compared to asynchronously.
      Synchronous VB movement was associated with a much stronger illusion of ownership
      over the Freud body. This suggests that this form of embodied perspective taking 
      can lead to sufficient detachment from habitual ways of thinking about personal
      problems, so as to improve the outcome, and demonstrates the power of virtual
      body ownership to effect cognitive changes.

TI  - Virtual reality training for improving the skills needed for performing surgery
      of the ear, nose or throat.
PG  - CD010198
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010198.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality simulation uses computer-generated imagery to present
      a simulated training environment for learners. This review seeks to examine
      whether there is evidence to support the introduction of virtual reality surgical
      simulation into ear, nose and throat surgical training programmes. OBJECTIVES: 1.
      To assess whether surgeons undertaking virtual reality simulation-based training 
      achieve surgical ('patient') outcomes that are at least as good as, or better
      than, those achieved through conventional training methods.2. To assess whether
      there is evidence from either the operating theatre, or from controlled
      (simulation centre-based) environments, that virtual reality-based surgical
      training leads to surgical skills that are comparable to, or better than, those
      achieved through conventional training. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Ear, Nose
      and Throat Disorders Group (CENTDG) Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the
      CENTDG Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015,
      Issue 6); PubMed; EMBASE; ERIC; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP
      and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the
      search was 27 July 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised
      controlled trials and controlled trials comparing virtual reality training and
      any other method of training in ear, nose or throat surgery. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane
      Collaboration. We evaluated both technical and non-technical aspects of skill
      competency. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine studies involving 210 participants.
      Out of these, four studies (involving 61 residents) assessed technical skills in 
      the operating theatre (primary outcomes). Five studies (comprising 149 residents 
      and medical students) assessed technical skills in controlled environments
      (secondary outcomes). The majority of the trials were at high risk of bias. We
      assessed the GRADE quality of evidence for most outcomes across studies as 'low'.
      Operating theatre environment (primary outcomes) In the operating theatre, there 
      were no studies that examined two of three primary outcomes: real world patient
      outcomes and acquisition of non-technical skills. The third primary outcome
      (technical skills in the operating theatre) was evaluated in two studies
      comparing virtual reality endoscopic sinus surgery training with conventional
      training. In one study, psychomotor skill (which relates to operative technique
      or the physical co-ordination associated with instrument handling) was assessed
      on a 10-point scale. A second study evaluated the procedural outcome of
      time-on-task. The virtual reality group performance was significantly better,
      with a better psychomotor score (mean difference (MD) 1.66, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.81; 
      10-point scale) and a shorter time taken to complete the operation (MD -5.50
      minutes, 95% CI -9.97 to -1.03). Controlled training environments (secondary
      outcomes) In a controlled environment five studies evaluated the technical skills
      of surgical trainees (one study) and medical students (three studies). One study 
      was excluded from the analysis. Surgical trainees: One study (80 participants)
      evaluated the technical performance of surgical trainees during temporal bone
      surgery, where the outcome was the quality of the final dissection. There was no 
      difference in the end-product scores between virtual reality and cadaveric
      temporal bone training. Medical students: Two other studies (40 participants)
      evaluated technical skills achieved by medical students in the temporal bone
      laboratory. Learners' knowledge of the flow of the operative procedure
      (procedural score) was better after virtual reality than conventional training
      (SMD 1.11, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.79). There was also a significant difference in
      end-product score between the virtual reality and conventional training groups
      (SMD 2.60, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.49). One study (17 participants) revealed that
      medical students acquired anatomical knowledge (on a scale of 0 to 10) better
      during virtual reality than during conventional training (MD 4.3, 95% CI 2.05 to 
      6.55). No studies in a controlled training environment assessed non-technical
      skills. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence to support the inclusion 
      of virtual reality surgical simulation into surgical training programmes, on the 
      basis that it can allow trainees to develop technical skills that are at least as
      good as those achieved through conventional training. Further investigations are 
      required to determine whether virtual reality training is associated with better 
      real world outcomes for patients and the development of non-technical skills.
      Virtual reality simulation may be considered as an additional learning tool for
      medical students.

TI  - Bullying victimisation and paranoid ideation in people at ultra high risk for
      psychosis.

LID - 10.1016/j.schres.2015.08.029 [doi]
LID - S0920-9964(15)00458-2 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bullying victimisation has been suggested to contribute to paranoid
      ideation in general population samples and recent evidence found that individuals
      with an ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis are twice as likely to have been
      bullied than controls. AIMS: This study sought to examine whether a history of
      bullying would be associated with higher levels of paranoid ideation in
      individuals with an UHR and in healthy controls (HCs). METHOD: The study included
      64 UHR and 43 HC participants. Following the baseline assessment, participants
      entered a Virtual Reality (VR) London Underground train. Paranoid ideation was
      measured immediately after the end of the VR experience. RESULTS: Compared to
      HCs, UHR participants described higher levels of childhood bullying (OR 5.19, 95%
      CI=2.21-12.19, p<.001) and experienced more paranoid ideation during VR
      (chi(2)(1)=21.06, p<.001). Childhood bullying was associated with paranoid
      ideation during VR in both groups (chi(2)(1)=5.931, p=,021) but prolonged
      exposure to bullying was not associated with increased paranoid ideation.
      CONCLUSION: A history of bullying in childhood is particularly common in young
      adults at high risk for psychosis. However bullying is associated with paranoid
      ideation in later life, independent of clinical status, consistent with
      dimensional models of psychotic phenomena.

TI  - Effects of extinction treatments on the reduction of conditioned responding and
      conditioned hyperarousal in a rabbit model of posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD).
PG  - 611-20
LID - 10.1037/bne0000092 [doi]
AB  - We have previously characterized a model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
      based on classical conditioning of the rabbit nictitating membrane response
      (NMR), that focuses on 2 key PTSD-like features: conditioned responses to
      trauma-associated cues and hyperarousal. In addition to the development of
      conditioned NMRs (CRs) to a tone conditioned stimulus (CS) associated with a
      periorbital shock unconditioned stimulus (US), we have observed that rabbits also
      exhibit a conditioning-specific reflex modification (CRM) of the NMR that
      manifests as an exaggerated and more complex reflexive NMR to presentations of
      the US by itself, particularly to intensities that elicited little response prior
      to conditioning. Previous work has demonstrated that unpaired presentations of
      the CS and US are successful at extinguishing CRs and CRM simultaneously, even
      when a significantly weakened version of the US is utilized. In the current
      study, additional extinction treatments were tested, including continued pairings
      of the CS with a weakened US and exposure to the training context alone, and
      these treatments were contrasted with the effects of unpaired extinction with a
      weakened US and remaining in home cages with no further treatment. Results showed
      that continued pairings only slightly decreased CRs and CRM, while context
      exposure had no effect on CRs and marginal effects on reducing CRM. Unpaired
      extinction was still the most effective treatment for reducing both. Findings are
      discussed in terms of applications to cognitive-behavioral therapies for
      treatment of PTSD, such as incorporating mild, innately stressful stimuli into
      virtual reality therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Using an abstract geometry in virtual reality to explore choice behaviour: visual
      flicker preferences in honeybees.
PG  - 3448-60
LID - 10.1242/jeb.125138 [doi]
AB  - Closed-loop paradigms provide an effective approach for studying visual choice
      behaviour and attention in small animals. Different flying and walking paradigms 
      have been developed to investigate behavioural and neuronal responses to
      competing stimuli in insects such as bees and flies. However, the variety of
      stimulus choices that can be presented over one experiment is often limited.
      Current choice paradigms are mostly constrained as single binary choice scenarios
      that are influenced by the linear structure of classical conditioning paradigms. 
      Here, we present a novel behavioural choice paradigm that allows animals to
      explore a closed geometry of interconnected binary choices by repeatedly
      selecting among competing objects, thereby revealing stimulus preferences in an
      historical context. We used our novel paradigm to investigate visual flicker
      preferences in honeybees (Apis mellifera) and found significant preferences for
      20-25 Hz flicker and avoidance of higher (50-100 Hz) and lower (2-4 Hz) flicker
      frequencies. Similar results were found when bees were presented with three
      simultaneous choices instead of two, and when they were given the chance to
      select previously rejected choices. Our results show that honeybees can
      discriminate among different flicker frequencies and that their visual
      preferences are persistent even under different experimental conditions.
      Interestingly, avoided stimuli were more attractive if they were novel,
      suggesting that novelty salience can override innate preferences. Our recursive
      virtual reality environment provides a new approach to studying visual
      discrimination and choice behaviour in animals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Technology allowing a remote, experienced surgeon to provide
      real-time guidance to local surgeons has great potential for training and
      capacity building in medical centers worldwide. Virtual interactive presence and 
      augmented reality (VIPAR), an iPad(R)-based tool, allows surgeons to provide
      long-distance virtual assistance wherever a wireless internet connection is
      available. Local and remote surgeons view a composite image of video feeds at
      each station, allowing for intraoperative telecollaboration in real time.
      METHODS: Local and remote stations were established in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam,
      and Birmingham, Alabama, as part of ongoing neurosurgical collaboration.
      Endoscopic third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus coagulation (ETV/CPC)
      utilizing VIPAR was used for subjective and objective evaluation of system
      performance. RESULTS: VIPAR allowed both surgeons to engage in complex visual and
      verbal communication during the procedure. Analysis of five video clips revealed 
      video delay of 237msec (range: 93-391msec) relative to the audio signal.
      Excellent image resolution allowed the remote neurosurgeon to visualize all
      critical anatomy. The remote neurosurgeon could gesture to structures with no
      detectable difference in accuracy between stations, allowing for sub-millimeter
      precision. Fifteen ETV/CPC procedures have been performed utilizing VIPAR between
      Vietnam and the United States, with no significant complications. 80% of these
      patients remain shunt-free. CONCLUSION: Evolving technologies allowing
      long-distance, intra-operative guidance and knowledge transfer hold great
      potential for highly efficient international neurosurgical education. VIPAR is
      one example of an inexpensive, scalable platform for increasing global
      neurosurgical capacity. Efforts to create a network of Vietnamese neurosurgeons
      using VIPAR for collaboration are underway.

AB  - Evidence from studies of provocative motion indicates that motion sickness is
      tightly linked to the disturbances of thermoregulation. The major aim of the
      current study was to determine whether provocative visual stimuli (immersion into
      the virtual reality simulating rides on a rollercoaster) affect skin temperature 
      that reflects thermoregulatory cutaneous responses, and to test whether such
      stimuli alter cognitive functions. In 26 healthy young volunteers wearing
      head-mounted display (Oculus Rift), simulated rides consistently provoked vection
      and nausea, with a significant difference between the two versions of simulation 
      software (Parrot Coaster and Helix). Basal finger temperature had bimodal
      distribution, with low-temperature group (n=8) having values of 23-29 degrees C, 
      and high-temperature group (n=18) having values of 32-36 degrees C. Effects of
      cybersickness on finger temperature depended on the basal level of this variable:
      in subjects from former group it raised by 3-4 degrees C, while in most subjects 
      from the latter group it either did not change or transiently reduced by 1.5-2
      degrees C. There was no correlation between the magnitude of changes in the
      finger temperature and nausea score at the end of simulated ride. Provocative
      visual stimulation caused prolongation of simple reaction time by 20-50ms; this
      increase closely correlated with the subjective rating of nausea. Lastly, in
      subjects who experienced pronounced nausea, heart rate was elevated. We conclude 
      that cybersickness is associated with changes in cutaneous thermoregulatory
      vascular tone; this further supports the idea of a tight link between motion
      sickness and thermoregulation. Cybersickness-induced prolongation of reaction
      time raises obvious concerns regarding the safety of this technology.

TI  - Matching and Reaching Depth Judgments with Real and Augmented Reality Targets.
PG  - 1289-98
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2459895 [doi]
AB  - Many compelling augmented reality (AR) applications require users to correctly
      perceive the location of virtual objects, some with accuracies as tight as 1 mm. 
      However, measuring the perceived depth of AR objects at these accuracies has not 
      yet been demonstrated. In this paper, we address this challenge by employing two 
      different depth judgment methods, perceptual matching and blind reaching, in a
      series of three experiments, where observers judged the depth of real and AR
      target objects presented at reaching distances. Our experiments found that
      observers can accurately match the distance of a real target, but when viewing an
      AR target through collimating optics, their matches systematically overestimate
      the distance by 0.5 to 4.0 cm. However, these results can be explained by a model
      where the collimation causes the eyes' vergence angle to rotate outward by a
      constant angular amount. These findings give error bounds for using collimating
      AR displays at reaching distances, and suggest that for these applications, AR
      displays need to provide an adjustable focus. Our experiments further found that 
      observers initially reach approximately 4 cm too short, but reaching accuracy
      improves with both consistent proprioception and corrective visual feedback, and 
      eventually becomes nearly as accurate as matching.

PG  - 355-9
LID - 10.1097/MOO.0000000000000181 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The field of temporal bone simulation (TBS) has largely
      focused on the development and validation of simulators as training and
      assessment tools. As technology has progressed over the years, researchers have, 
      however, envisioned new clinical applications for simulators extending to
      preoperative surgical planning and case rehearsal. The purpose of this article
      was to review the current state of the art in TBS and to highlight recent
      advancements in the field. Because of space limitations, we will limit our
      discussion to computer-based virtual reality simulators. RECENT FINDINGS: A
      review of the recent literature on TBS revealed very limited application of
      virtual reality simulators for preoperative preparation. Current evidence
      suggests limitations in fidelity preclude successful patient-specific case
      rehearsal using virtual reality simulation. Further investigation and clinical
      evaluation are required to validate its use outside of training and skill
      assessment. SUMMARY: This article provides an overview of the current use of
      virtual reality simulators with emphasis on preoperative planning. We evaluate
      the limitations of the technology, and discuss potential areas of improvement for
      the future. More studies are necessary to assess the value of virtual reality
      simulation for preoperative preparation.

TI  - A physical simulator for endoscopic endonasal drilling techniques: technical
      note.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - In this paper, the authors present a physical model developed to teach surgeons
      the requisite drilling techniques when using an endoscopic endonasal approach
      (EEA) to the skull base. EEA is increasingly used for treating pathologies of the
      ventral and ventrolateral cranial base. Endonasal drilling is a unique skill in
      terms of the instruments used, the long reach required, and the restricted
      angulation, and gaining competency requires much practice. Based on the
      successful experience in creating custom simulators, the authors used 3D printing
      to build an EEA training model from post-processed thin-cut head CT scans,
      formulating the materials to provide realistic haptic feedback and endoscope
      handling. They performed a preliminary assessment at 2 institutions to evaluate
      content validity of the simulator as the first step of the validation process.
      Overall results were positive, particularly in terms of bony landmarks and haptic
      response, though minor refinements were suggested prior to use as a training
      device.

      Psychological Disorders.
PG  - 862942
LID - 10.1155/2015/862942 [doi]
AB  - Augmented Reality is a new technological system that allows introducing virtual
      contents in the real world in order to run in the same representation and, in
      real time, enhancing the user's sensory perception of reality. From another point
      of view, Augmented Reality can be defined as a set of techniques and tools that
      add information to the physical reality. To date, Augmented Reality has been used
      in many fields, such as medicine, entertainment, maintenance, architecture,
      education, and cognitive and motor rehabilitation but very few studies and
      applications of AR exist in clinical psychology. In the treatment of
      psychological disorders, Augmented Reality has given preliminary evidence to be a
      useful tool due to its adaptability to the patient needs and therapeutic purposes
      and interactivity. Another relevant factor is the quality of the user's
      experience in the Augmented Reality system determined from emotional engagement
      and sense of presence. This experience could increase the AR ecological validity 
      in the treatment of psychological disorders. This paper reviews the recent
      studies on the use of Augmented Reality in the evaluation and treatment of
      psychological disorders, focusing on current uses of this technology and on the
      specific features that delineate Augmented Reality a new technique useful for
      psychology.

TI  - The Use of Virtual Reality in Psychology: A Case Study in Visual Perception.
PG  - 151702
LID - 10.1155/2015/151702 [doi]
AB  - Recent proliferation of available virtual reality (VR) tools has seen increased
      use in psychological research. This is due to a number of advantages afforded
      over traditional experimental apparatus such as tighter control of the
      environment and the possibility of creating more ecologically valid stimulus
      presentation and response protocols. At the same time, higher levels of immersion
      and visual fidelity afforded by VR do not necessarily evoke presence or elicit a 
      "realistic" psychological response. The current paper reviews some current uses
      for VR environments in psychological research and discusses some ongoing
      questions for researchers. Finally, we focus on the area of visual perception,
      where both the advantages and challenges of VR are particularly salient.

TI  - Using a Virtual Environment to Examine How Children Cross Streets: Advancing Our 
      Understanding of How Injury Risk Arises.
LID - jsv078 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine how risk of injury can arise for child pedestrians. METHODS: 
      Using a highly immersive virtual reality system interfaced with a 3-D movement
      measurement system, younger (M = 8 years) and older (M = 10 years) children's
      crossing behaviors were measured under conditions that introduced variation in
      vehicle speed, distance, and intervehicle gaps. RESULTS: Children used distance
      cues in deciding when to cross; there were no age or sex differences. This
      increased risk of injury in larger intervehicle gaps because they started late
      and did not monitor traffic or adjust walking speed as they crossed. In contrast,
      injury risk in smaller intervehicle gaps of equal risk (i.e., same time to
      contact) occurred because crossing behavioral adjustments (starting early,
      increasing walking speed while crossing) were not sufficient. CONCLUSIONS:
      Dependence on distance cues increases children's risk of injury as pedestrians
      when crossing in a variety of traffic situations.

      children with cerebral palsy.

AB  - While feedback-controlled treadmills with a virtual reality could potentially
      offer advantages for clinical gait analysis and training, the effect of
      self-paced walking and the virtual environment on the gait pattern of children
      and different patient groups remains unknown. This study examined the effect of
      self-paced (SP) versus fixed speed (FS) walking and of walking with and without a
      virtual reality (VR) in 11 typically developing (TD) children and nine children
      with cerebral palsy (CP). We found that subjects walked in SP mode with twice as 
      much between-stride walking speed variability (p<0.01), fluctuating over multiple
      strides. There was no main effect of SP on kinematics or kinetics, but small
      interaction effects between SP and group (TD versus CP) were found for five out
      of 33 parameters. This suggests that children with CP might need more time to
      familiarize to SP walking, however, these differences were generally too small to
      be clinically relevant. The VR environment did not affect the kinematic or
      kinetic parameters, but walking with VR was rated as more similar to overground
      walking by both groups (p=0.02). The results of this study indicate that both SP 
      and FS walking, with and without VR, can be used interchangeably for
      treadmill-based clinical gait analysis in children with and without CP.

TI  - Resolving the Vergence-Accommodation Conflict in Head-Mounted Displays.
AB  - The vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC) remains a major problem in head-mounted
      displays for virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR). In this review, I discuss
      why this problem is pivotal for nearby tasks in VR and AR, present a
      comprehensive taxonomy of potential solutions, address advantages and shortfalls 
      of each design, and cover various ways to better evaluate the solutions. The
      review describes how VAC is addressed in monocular, stereoscopic, and multiscopic
      HMDs, including retinal scanning and accommodation-free displays.
      Eye-tracking-based approaches that do not provide natural focal cues -
      gaze-guided blur and dynamic stereoscopy - are also covered. Promising future
      research directions in this area are identified.

TI  - The Virtual Flier: The Link Trainer, Flight Simulation, and Pilot Identity.
PG  - 28-53
LID - 10.1353/tech.2015.0017 [doi]
AB  - The Link Trainer is often described as the first successful attempt at what we
      now recognize as flight simulation and even virtual reality. Instead of asking
      how well the device simulated flight conditions, this article shows that what the
      Link Trainer simulated was not the conditions of the air, but rather the
      conditions of the cockpit that was gradually filled with flight instruments. The 
      article also considers the Link Trainer as a cultural space in which shifting
      ideas about what it meant to be a pilot were manifested. A pilot in the Link
      Trainer was trained into a new category of flier-the virtual flier-who was an
      avid reader of instruments and an attentive listener to signals. This article
      suggests that, by situating the pilot within new spaces, protocols, and
      relationships, technologies of simulation have constituted the identity of the
      modern pilot and other operators of machines.

TI  - Learning Curves of Virtual Mastoidectomy in Distributed and Massed Practice.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1001/jamaoto.2015.1563 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Repeated and deliberate practice is crucial in surgical skills
      training, and virtual reality (VR) simulation can provide self-directed training 
      of basic surgical skills to meet the individual needs of the trainee. Assessment 
      of the learning curves of surgical procedures is pivotal in understanding skills 
      acquisition and best-practice implementation and organization of training.
      Objective: To explore the learning curves of VR simulation training of
      mastoidectomy and the effects of different practice sequences with the aim of
      proposing the optimal organization of training. Design, Setting, and
      Participants: A prospective trial with a 2 x 2 design was conducted at an
      academic teaching hospital. Participants included 43 novice medical students. Of 
      these, 21 students completed time-distributed practice from October 14 to
      November 29, 2013, and a separate group of 19 students completed massed practice 
      on May 16, 17, or 18, 2014. Data analysis was performed from June 6, 2014, to
      March 3, 2015. Interventions: Participants performed 12 repeated virtual
      mastoidectomies using a temporal bone surgical simulator in either a distributed 
      (practice blocks spaced in time) or massed (all practice in 1 day) training
      program with randomization for simulator-integrated tutoring during the first 5
      sessions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Performance was assessed using a modified
      Welling Scale for final product analysis by 2 blinded senior otologists. Results:
      Compared with the 19 students in the massed practice group, the 21 students in
      the distributed practice group were older (mean age, 25.1 years), more often male
      (15 [62%]), and had slightly higher mean gaming frequency (2.3 on a 1-5 Likert
      scale). Learning curves were established and distributed practice was found to be
      superior to massed practice, reported as mean end score (95% CI) of 15.7
      (14.4-17.0) in distributed practice vs 13.0 (11.9-14.1) with massed practice (P =
      .002). Simulator-integrated tutoring accelerated the initial performance, with
      mean score for tutored sessions of 14.6 (13.9-15.2) vs 13.4 (12.8-14.0) for
      corresponding nontutored sessions (P < .01) but at the cost of a drop in
      performance once tutoring ceased. The performance drop was less with distributed 
      practice, suggesting a protective effect when acquired skills were consolidated
      over time. The mean performance of the nontutored participants in the distributed
      practice group plateaued on a score of 16.0 (15.3-16.7) at approximately the
      ninth repetition, but the individual learning curves were highly variable.
      Conclusions and Relevance: Novices can acquire basic mastoidectomy competencies
      with self-directed VR simulation training. Training should be organized with
      distributed practice, and simulator-integrated tutoring can be useful to
      accelerate the initial learning curve. Practice should be deliberate and toward a
      standard set level of proficiency that remains to be defined rather than toward
      the mean learning curve plateau.

TI  - Developing Mixed Reality Educational Applications: The Virtual Touch Toolkit.
PG  - 21760-84
LID - 10.3390/s150921760 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we present Virtual Touch, a toolkit that allows the development of
      educational activities through a mixed reality environment such that, using
      various tangible elements, the interconnection of a virtual world with the real
      world is enabled. The main goal of Virtual Touch is to facilitate the
      installation, configuration and programming of different types of technologies,
      abstracting the creator of educational applications from the technical details
      involving the use of tangible interfaces and virtual worlds. Therefore, it is
      specially designed to enable teachers to themselves create educational activities
      for their students in a simple way, taking into account that teachers generally
      lack advanced knowledge in computer programming and electronics. The toolkit has 
      been used to develop various educational applications that have been tested in
      two secondary education high schools in Spain.

TI  - Using Technology to Meet the Challenges of Medical Education.
PG  - 260-70
AB  - Medical education is rapidly changing, influenced by many factors including the
      changing health care environment, the changing role of the physician, altered
      societal expectations, rapidly changing medical science, and the diversity of
      pedagogical techniques. Changes in societal expectations put patient safety in
      the forefront, and raises the ethical issues of learning interactions and
      procedures on live patients, with the long-standing teaching method of "see one, 
      do one, teach one" no longer acceptable. The educational goals of using
      technology in medical education include facilitating basic knowledge acquisition,
      improving decision making, enhancement of perceptual variation, improving skill
      coordination, practicing for rare or critical events, learning team training, and
      improving psychomotor skills. Different technologies can address these goals.
      Technologies such as podcasts and videos with flipped classrooms, mobile devices 
      with apps, video games, simulations (part-time trainers, integrated simulators,
      virtual reality), and wearable devices (google glass) are some of the techniques 
      available to address the changing educational environment. This article presents 
      how the use of technologies can provide the infrastructure and basis for
      addressing many of the challenges in providing medical education for the future.

AB  - Relatively little is known about the influence of psychosocial factors, such as
      familial role modeling and social network on the development and maintenance of
      childhood obesity. We investigated peer selection using an immersive virtual
      reality environment. In a virtual schoolyard, children were confronted with
      normal weight and overweight avatars either eating or playing. Fifty-seven
      children aged 7-13 participated. Interpersonal distance to the avatars, child's
      BMI, self-perception, eating behavior and parental BMI were assessed. Parental
      BMI was the strongest predictor for the children's minimal distance to the
      avatars. Specifically, a higher mothers' BMI was associated with greater
      interpersonal distance and children approached closer to overweight eating
      avatars. A higher father's BMI was associated with a lower interpersonal distance
      to the avatars. These children approached normal weight playing and overweight
      eating avatar peers closest. The importance of parental BMI for the child's
      social approach/avoidance behavior can be explained through social modeling
      mechanisms. Differential effects of paternal and maternal BMI might be due to
      gender specific beauty ideals. Interventions to promote social interaction with
      peer groups could foster weight stabilization or weight loss in children.

TI  - Robots and ICT to support play in children with severe physical disabilities: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - PURPOSE: Play is an essential part of children's lives. Children with physical
      disabilities experience difficulties in play, especially those with severe
      physical disabilities. With the progress of innovative technology, the
      possibilities to support play are increasing. The purpose of this literature
      study is to gain insight into the aims, control options and commercial
      availability of information and communication technology (ICT) and robots to
      support play (especially play for the sake of play) in children with severe
      physical disabilities. METHODS: A systematic literature search in the databases
      PubMed, CINAHL, IEEE and ERIC was carried out. Titles and abstracts were assessed
      independently by three reviewers. In addition, studies were selected using Google
      Scholar, conference proceedings and reference lists. RESULTS: Three main groups
      of technology for play could be distinguished: robots (n = 8), virtual reality
      systems (n = 15) and computer systems (n = 4). Besides, ICT and robots developed 
      for specific therapy or educational goals using play-like activities, five of the
      in total 27 technologies in this study described the aim of "play for play's
      sake". CONCLUSIONS: Many ICT systems and robots to support play in children with 
      physical disabilities were found. Numerous technologies use play-like activities 
      to achieve therapeutic or educational goals. Robots especially are used for "play
      for play's sake". Implications for Rehabilitation This study gives insight into
      the aims, control options and commercial availability for application of robots
      and ICT to support play in children with severe physical disabilities. This
      overview can be used in both the fields of rehabilitation and special education
      to search for new innovative intervention options and it can stimulate them to
      use these innovative play materials. Especially robots may have great potential
      in supporting "play for play's sake".

TI  - Heart rate variability (HRV) during virtual reality immersion.
PG  - 47-54
LID - 10.1080/10803548.2015.1017964 [doi]
AB  - The goal of the study was assessment of the hour-long training involving handling
      virtual environment (sVR) and watching a stereoscopic 3D movie on the mechanisms 
      of autonomic heart rate (HR) regulation among the subjects who were not
      predisposed to motion sickness. In order to exclude predispositions to motion
      sickness, all the participants (n=19) underwent a Coriolis test. During an
      exposure to 3D and sVR the ECG signal was continuously recorded using the Holter 
      method. For the twelve consecutive 5-min epochs of ECG signal, the analysis of
      heart rate variability (HRV) in time and frequency domains was conducted. After
      30 min from the beginning of the training in handling the virtual workstation a
      significant increase in LF spectral power was noted. The values of the
      sympathovagal LF/HF index while sVR indicated a significant increase in
      sympathetic predominance in four time intervals, namely between the 5th and the
      10th minute, between the 15th and the 20th minute, between the 35th and 40th
      minute and between the 55th and the 60th minute of exposure.

TI  - Head tracking in virtual reality displays reduces the misperception of 3D motion.
PG  - 1180
LID - 10.1167/15.12.1180 [doi]
AB  - Observers rely on multiple complementary sensory cues to guide behavior.
      Previously, we showed that when observers estimate 3D object motion, they exhibit
      a surprising tendency to confuse approaching and receding motion (Fulvio et al,
      JOV 2014). However, such confusion seems to rarely occur in real world motion
      estimation. Extra-retinal cues such as head motion likely help disambiguate
      motion in depth. We tested this using the Oculus Rift, a head-mounted virtual
      reality display that can provide appropriate sensory feedback in response to
      changes in head orientation. We predicted that if observers rely on head motion
      to disambiguate motion in depth, accuracy in estimation of 3D object motion would
      improve with more natural viewing conditions. On each trial, a target with one of
      3 contrast levels moved in a randomly chosen direction in the horizontal plane
      for 1s before disappearing. Observers (n=28) then adjusted the position of a
      'paddle' around an invisible orbit so that it would intercept the target had it
      continued along the trajectory. Three head-motion conditions were tested: (i)
      'fixed' - no updating with head orientation; (ii) 'tracked' - display updating
      with changes in head orientation; (iii) 'lagged' - display updating delayed by
      50ms. Feedback was not provided. Reduced target contrast increased the proportion
      of motion in depth confusions across head-motion conditions (t(207)=-12.905,
      p&lt; 0.001, d=0.89). Importantly, changes in head orientation were small
      (average max ~ 0.94deg in 3D space), yet had a significant effect on performance 
      (t(207)=-3.3491, p&lt; 0.001, d=0.23) - motion in depth confusions were less
      likely in the tracked versus fixed condition (t(166)=-1.94, p=0.027, d=0.42). We 
      did not find differences between the tracked and lagged conditions (p=0.69), or
      fixed and lagged conditions (p=0.13). These results reveal a critical role for
      extra-retinal cues in 3D motion perception and contribute to the understanding of
      cross-modal integration. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2015.

TI  - Incorrect haptic feedback in 50% of trials is sufficient to bias grip aperture.
PG  - 1150
LID - 10.1167/15.12.1150 [doi]
AB  - Grasping behavior is being tested increasingly often in virtual and mirror
      setups. In displays where the visual percept does not correspond to physical
      reality (e.g., distorted depth perception under limited cue conditions) an
      important methodological question is what and how much haptic feedback to
      provide. While grasping without haptic feedback has been shown to drift, both in 
      position and aperture size (Bingham, Coats, & Mon-Williams, 2007,
      Neuropsychologia, 45, 288-294), grasping with terminal haptic feedback that does 
      not correspond to the visual information has been shown to bias both reaching
      distance and maximum grip aperture (MGA) in the direction of the haptic feedback 
      (Mon-Williams & Bingham, 2007, JEP:HPP, 33, 645-656; Coats, Bingham, &
      Mon-Williams, 2008, Experimental Brain Research, 189, 211-220). An ideal balance 
      would be to find a level of haptic feedback that allows for natural grasping,
      while not biasing behavior. Because presenting correct haptic feedback on 50% of 
      trials has been shown to produce normal grasping (Bingham et al., 2007), we
      therefore tested whether providing haptic feedback that differed from visual
      information by 5mm on 50% of trials would bias MGAs in the direction of the
      haptic feedback. We found that incorrect feedback on 50% of trials did appear to 
      bias grasping (N=32). We additionally noticed that MGAs decreased over time even 
      when correct haptic feedback was presented 100% of the time. We believe this may 
      have been due to participants' initial uncertainty in the mirror setup, which
      decreased over time. Our findings underscore the difficulty of providing haptic
      feedback that does not bias the grasping response. Changes in the grip aperture
      found in the 100% correct haptic feedback condition also highlight a potential
      difficulty in defining baseline grasping behavior when using mirror setups.

TI  - Grasping lacks depth constancy in both virtual and real environments.
PG  - 1147
LID - 10.1167/15.12.1147 [doi]
AB  - The use of virtual reality setups allows sophisticated manipulations of visual
      and haptic feedback important for the study of grasping movements. On this
      respect, the absence of feedback is shown to induce different systematic biases
      in visuomotor tasks, such as underestimation of the target distance and, above
      all, lack of the target depth constancy. The latter is revealed by a decrease in 
      grip aperture with target distance increase, thus resembling biases in perceptual
      estimates of relative depths. However, whether these findings are mostly caused
      by the use of virtual reality rather than by an intrinsic property of the
      visuomotor system is still an open and debated question. We addressed this issue 
      by comparing grasping movements performed in three experimental conditions:
      lights-on (L), glow-in-the-dark (G) and virtual (V). In condition L, a natural
      grasping towards the object was performed with the lights on; in condition G,
      feedback of the hand and object were rendered covering the distal phalanges of
      thumb and index finger and the object with glowing material; in condition V, the 
      visual feedback of the hand and object was virtually provided and only defined by
      binocular cues. A spherical object was located at four different distances (420, 
      450, 480, 510 mm) and 16 subjects performed 40 trials for each condition. Results
      indicate a difference between conditions related to the duration of the movement 
      but, strikingly, they show a clear and strong effect of object distance on the
      grip aperture in all the conditions equally. Specifically, grip aperture
      gradually decreased with increasing object distance, therefore revealing a clear 
      lack of depth constancy. These findings demonstrate that systematic biases in
      grasping actions are not a prerogative of virtual environments and that the
      visuomotor system is subject to the same biases affecting perceptual estimates.

TI  - Does donepezil improve visual stimuli detection and perceptivo-cognitive
      performance of heathy young adults ?
PG  - 1133
LID - 10.1167/15.12.1133 [doi]
AB  - Donepezil enhances the cholinergic synaptic transmission in the brain by
      inhibiting the enzyme that metabolizes acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft,
      thereby prolonging the action of this neurotransmitter. It has been demonstrated 
      that chronic administration of donepezil increases perceptual learning. Our study
      examines the effect of acute administration of donepezil on first and second
      order visual stimuli detection on one hand and on perceptual-cognitive
      performance on the other hand. A double-blind, placebo controlled design was used
      to evaluate the effect of cholinergic enhancement - donepezil administration (5
      mg, given per os) - on visual attention using two different attention tasks. 10
      young healthy adults were enrolled in each group. The task was performed 3 hours 
      after the donepezil (or placebo) intake to synchronize with the peak plasma
      concentration of the drug. We started by testing the first and second order
      visual detection for motion and direction using the Neurominder task (Habak &
      Faubert, 2000) before and after taking donepezil. Motion and direction
      identification thresholds for the first order and second order visual detection
      were identical before and after donepezil intake. The multifocal attention of the
      participant was tested by the multiple object tracking task (Legault and Faubert,
      2012). During this perceptual-cognitive task, the observer is required to
      simultaneously track multiple moving items among distracters in a dynamic virtual
      reality environment. The task is repeated once a week during 5 weeks to test the 
      effect of learning. The speed thresholds in the MOT task increased significantly 
      in each session in the same range for both donepezil and control groups. Our
      results suggest that an acute 5mg dose of donepezil might not be sufficient to
      elicit perceptual-cognitive or visual detection performance improvement when
      given to healthy young subjects. Additional studies are needed to better define
      the involvement of acetylcholine enhancement on perceptual learning/attentional
      tasks. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2015.

PG  - 1101
LID - 10.1167/15.12.1101 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We used judgements of distance and direction to examine whether
      observers combine cues to construct a single unified representation of the
      environment as they move within it. METHODS: Observers moved in a virtual reality
      simulation of a room with brick-textured walls and a checkerboard-textured floor.
      Upon entering a view-zone to the left of the room, a red sphere appeared 1.6m in 
      front of the observer (Interval-1). Observers judged the position of the sphere
      and pressed a button triggering a half-second inter-stimulus-interval. Unknown to
      the observers, when the room reappeared (Interval-2) it had uniformly scaled in
      size around their cyclopean point. Experiment 1: observers walked rightward
      across the room, entering a second view-zone, upon which a second red sphere
      appeared in front of view-zone one. Observers judged whether the visual direction
      of the sphere in Interval-2 was to the left or right of the sphere in Interval-1.
      Experiment 2: observers remained in view-zone one, and a second ball appeared in 
      front of them. They judged whether this ball was closer or further from them than
      the ball in Interval-1. In both experiments, we measured thresholds for
      "texture-based" cues (those unaffected by room expansion e.g. texture) and
      "physical-based" cues (those that could signal metric object position e.g. stereo
      and motion parallax) in isolation and used these to predict performance in a
      "combined-cues" condition where both cues varied. RESULTS: For both distance and 
      direction, observers combined cues "optimally", such that performance in the
      combined-cues condition was well predicted by the single cue sensitivities.
      However, these "optimal" estimates were mutually inconsistent due to (1)
      differential weighting of physical- and texture-based cues and (2) different
      biases in the judgements made in the two tasks. CONCLUSION: In our experiment
      optimal cue combination was incompatible with observers constructing a single
      unified representation of the environment. Meeting abstract presented at VSS

TI  - Depth Perception of Augmented Reality Information in an Automotive Contact Analog
      Head-Up Display.
PG  - 1078
LID - 10.1167/15.12.1078 [doi]
AB  - In an automotive contact analog head-up display (cHUD), virtual information can
      be presented in augmented reality manner in the driver's primary field of view,
      minimizing mental transformation effort for the driver. Whether virtual
      information in the cHUD is really perceived at the correct location in the
      environment depends on several factors such as the technological specifications
      of the cHUD, the design of the virtual information or environmental conditions.
      One possibility to realize a cHUD is to implement an upright virtual image in a
      distance at which human depth perception is supposed to rely on monocular depth
      cues only (&gt; 6m). So far it has not been investigated whether this technology 
      succeeds at conveying the correct spatial impression of the virtual information
      to the driver. In the current study, we investigated whether depth perception of 
      lying navigation arrows in a cHUD with a fixed virtual image distance of 10m was 
      influenced by (a) whether the arrow was overlaid on the road surface or
      superimposed on a leading vehicle and by (b) whether it was shaded/ desaturated
      with increasing distance or not. Arrows were randomly presented for 1sec at
      suggested distances of 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40m. Participants had to match the
      virtual arrows in the cHUD to distance markers in front of the car.
      Superimposition led to a significant increase in errors compared to the
      projection onto the street surface but did not affect reaction times. Increasing 
      distance led to significantly increased reaction times but fewer errors
      (speed-accuracy tradeoff). The impact of superimposition on error rates was
      significantly more pronounced in nearer distances. Shading did not have an effect
      on error rates or reaction times. The results have important implications for the
      further development of automotive cHUD technology and related design concepts.

TI  - Effects of perceptual load in visual search in immersive virtual reality.
PG  - 1064
LID - 10.1167/15.12.1064 [doi]
AB  - Research using computerized displays of simple stimuli has identified perceptual 
      load as a critical factor for modulating distraction. Distraction is stronger
      when perceptual load is low than when it is high. Typically, participants
      determine which of two targets, e.g., letters, is present in a search array
      composed of other letters and perceptual load of the displays is varied. In the
      present experiment we made contact with the literature but increased ecological
      validity by assessing distraction in immersive Virtual Reality (VR), in which
      life-sized stimuli can be displayed in realistic settings, without losing the
      advantage of controlling conditions. Participants searched for a target (soda or 
      yoghurt) among other daily objects on the countertop in a virtual kitchen. The
      search array was accompanied by a congruent or incongruent flanker. Perceptual
      load was manipulated. As expected, participants responded slower with incongruent
      flankers (flanker effect) and with high load (load effect), confirming that our
      materials and set up in the VR environment were suitable to elicit the basic
      effects. Contrary to our expectations based on the load theory of attention the
      flanker effect was not modulated by load. This finding may suggest that
      perceptual load may play a smaller role in attention and search in everyday
      situations than one would assume based on previous work. Obviously, virtual
      scenarios are more complex than the stimuli used and the conditions run in
      previous studies. Further, it is possible that daily, very familiar objects may
      be harder to ignore or be prioritized for processing also under high perceptual
      load. We discuss factors that may dilute or negate effects of perceptual load in 
      a more ecologically valid situation and outline suggestions for further research.
      We suggest that VR offers an exciting interdisciplinary approach that may
      challenge our beliefs based on traditional laboratory research. Meeting abstract 
      presented at VSS 2015.

TI  - After-effects in the learning of sensorimotor mappings for the visually-guided
      control of hand gestures.
PG  - 986
LID - 10.1167/15.12.986 [doi]
AB  - The learning of sensorimotor mappings is often associated with after-effects
      (Helmholtz, 1909/1962). We investigated after-effects during the learning of hand
      gestures that required participants to control a simulated hand in virtual
      reality (Adamovich et al., 2009). METHODS: Finger movements (joint angles) were
      recorded with a data glove and were exploited for the online animation of a human
      hand model using a game engine. In the first phase of the experiment (baseline), 
      the measured joint angles were mapped one-to-one onto the joint angles of the
      virtual hand. In the second phase (adaptation), this mapping was modified by
      flipping the joint angles of the index and the middle finger, and the ones of the
      ring and the little fingers. In the final phase (deadaptation), again the
      original natural mapping was reestablished. Participants had to reproduce hand
      gestures that were indicated by static pictures of hand postures. Training was
      terminated after 32 trials in the adaptation phase and after 16 trials in the
      deadaptation phase. RESULTS: In the adaptation phase, humans adapt to the
      unnatural sensorimotor mapping in a gradually improving manner, typically taking 
      about 10-15 trials. The postural error and the reaction time are increased
      significantly (p &lt; 0.001) at the beginning of the adaptation phase, and both
      measures returned to the baseline at the end of the learning. In the deadaptation
      phase both measures were increased typically only one or two trials before they
      returned to baseline p &gt; 0.95 for both measures). CONCLUSIONS: The observed
      behavior seems not compatible with a standard sensorimotor adaptation effect,
      since the original sensorimotor mapping could be immediately established after
      adaptation within a single trial. Instead, after learning participants seem to
      recognize the appropriate sensorimotor mapping immediately, realizing it
      perfectly without observable after-effects. REFERENCES: Helmholtz, H.

PG  - 955
LID - 10.1167/15.12.955 [doi]
AB  - The study of egocentric position estimation may shed light on visuospatial memory
      processes, such as physical space representation in our visual system. However,
      little has been done to test egocentric position estimation in humans and the few
      studies to date have investigated egocentric position estimation with context to 
      ground or other stable visual cues. In this study, human participants are
      introduced to a three-dimensional virtual reality (VR) generated by a 120 Hz
      projector with a polarization filter and polarizing glasses that separated left
      and right eye images in a frame sequential stereoscopic configuration.
      Participants were placed in the center of a VR cylinder where 5,000 sesame dots
      were distributed at random distances (112cm to 168cm) from the participant,
      azimuth (+/- 29.12 degrees ), and height (120cm to 188cm from the floor). Nine
      possible targets were located on a horizontal plane 50cm from the participant's
      eye level on a three by three matrix at right, left, center azimuths (+/- 18.64
      degrees , 0 degrees ), and near, middle, and far distances (126cm, 137cm, 147cm
      from the participant). Participants were presented with one randomly selected
      target for 3 to 5 seconds before the target was relocated to a random location
      within the sesame dot field. The task was to reposition the target back to the
      original position. Depth was induced using disparity and size cues, except for
      sesame dots that had only disparity cues. Errors in distance repositioning
      occurred along the line of sight and repositioning showed an attraction bias
      toward the relocated target. Elevation repositioning was higher for farther
      targets (P &lt; 0.05, F = 3.19). Azimuth repositioning for left targets were
      significantly shifted to the right (P&lt; 0.01, F= 18.42). Standard deviations
      for distance repositioning were invariant against target distance, suggesting
      that egocentric visuospatial representation is based on Cartesian metrics rather 
      than polar coordinates. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2015.

TI  - Spatial memory relative to the 3D environment guides body orientation in visual
      search.
PG  - 947
LID - 10.1167/15.12.947 [doi]
AB  - Measurement of eye movements has revealed rapid development of memory for object 
      locations in 3D immersive environments. To examine the nature of that
      representation, and to see if memory is coded with respect to the 3D coordinates 
      of the room, head position was recorded while participants performed a visual
      search task in an immersive virtual reality apartment. The apartment had two
      rooms, connected by a corridor. Participants searched the apartment for a series 
      of geometric target objects. Some target objects were always placed at the same
      location (stable objects), while others appeared at a new location in each trial 
      (random objects). We analyzed whether body movements showed changes that
      reflected memory for target location. In each trial we calculated how far the
      participant's trajectory deviated from a straight path to the target object.
      Changes in head orientation from the moment the room was entered to the moment
      the target was reached were also computed. We found that the average deviation
      from the straight path was larger and more variable for random target objects
      (.47 vs .31 meters). Also the point of maximum deviation from the straight path
      occurred earlier for random objects than for stable objects (at 42% vs 52% of the
      total trajectory). On room entry lateral head deviation from the room center was 
      already bigger for stable objects than for random objects (18 masculine vs. 10
      masculine). Thus for random objects participants move to the center of the room
      until the target is located, while for stable objects subjects are more likely to
      follow a straight trajectory from first entry. We conclude that memory for target
      location is coded with respect to room coordinates and is revealed by body
      orientation at first entry. The visually guided component of search seems to be
      relatively unimportant or occurs very quickly upon entry. Meeting abstract

TI  - Objects in the peripheral visual field influence gaze location in natural vision.
PG  - 783
LID - 10.1167/15.12.783 [doi]
AB  - In everyday behavior there are multiple competing demands for gaze; for instance,
      walking along a sidewalk requires paying attention to the path while avoiding
      other pedestrians. Therefore, humans make numerous fixations to satisfy their
      behavioral goals. One attempt to explore suitable strategies of gaze allocation
      for natural situations was made by Sprague, Ballard and Robinson (2007), whose
      computational model predicts human visuo-motor behavior based on intrinsic reward
      and uncertainty. Their model presupposes that specific visual information is
      acquired from the currently fixated object only. However, evidence that
      peripheral objects affect gaze position by drawing it towards the center of
      gravity of target ensembles (Findlay, 1982; Vishwanath & Kowler, 2003) challenges
      this premise. Since the influence of peripheral information for natural vision
      remains largely unexplored, we investigated whether gaze targeting is biased
      towards peripheral objects in naturalistic tasks. Using a Virtual Reality
      environment, the fixations of 12 participants were examined while they walked
      through a virtual room with objects of two different colors that were designated 
      targets or obstacles. The subjects were instructed to either collect targets, to 
      avoid obstacles or to do both tasks simultaneously. For situations in which one
      of two visible objects was fixated, subjects' gaze positions were biased more
      often towards the non-fixated object (72.6%) than away from it (27.4%). Moreover,
      the gaze position tended to be drawn more frequently towards the neighboring
      object when this neighbor was relevant to the current task than when it was
      task-irrelevant. These results indicate that information from peripheral objects 
      affect human gaze targeting in natural vision. Furthermore, the effect of the
      neighbor's task-relevance - and therefore of intrinsic reward - suggests that in 
      a given fixation subjects might gather information from the peripheral visual
      field to accomplish a current set of goals at once. Meeting abstract presented at

TI  - Steering along curved paths is influenced by global flow speed not speed
      asymmetry.
PG  - 416
LID - 10.1167/15.12.416 [doi]
AB  - Retinal flow, the pattern of motion caused by self-motion through a textured
      world, is used to control steering. Our previous work has shown that flow
      asymmetries influence humans steering along demarcated paths, with different
      textures on either side of the path causing biases consistent with participants
      reducing flow asymmetries (Kountouriotis et al., 2013). To test whether
      asymmetries in speed also bias locomotor control, participants were asked to
      steer a series of curved trajectories in a virtual reality simulated environment.
      Regions of the ground plane either side of a visible bounded path were rotated at
      different speeds to create flow asymmetries. The manipulation varied (i)
      Asymmetry Direction: whether the ground to the inside of the bend moved slower or
      faster than the outside of the bend, (ii) Asymmetry Size: whether the difference 
      in speeds of the two regions was a small gap or a large gap, and (iii) Global
      Flow Speed: whether the average speed across both regions was slower than, the
      same as, or faster than the actual locomotor travel speed. The results suggest
      that participants did not simply equalise the flow vectors (i.e. steer towards
      the slower-moving region) since asymmetry size and direction did not
      systematically alter steering. Instead, participants were influenced by the
      global flow speed, whereby faster global flow led to greater oversteer (towards
      the inside of the bend) and vice versa. Importantly, steering biases occurred
      despite the visible path providing splay angle information across all conditions.
      We conclude that global flow speed is used to control locomotor steering even
      when travelling along visible paths that provide alternative useful sources of
      information Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2015.

TI  - Prospective steering control is influenced by retinal flow.
PG  - 414
LID - 10.1167/15.12.414 [doi]
AB  - Both retinal flow and visible road edges are potentially useful sources of
      information when steering down a road. Influential models of driving have
      identified a role for "near" and "far" road edge components, but it has been
      shown that flow is used even when complete road edges are present (Kountouriotis 
      et al., 2013). The aim of the present study was to assess whether flow is used
      when different road edge components were available. We tested 20 participants
      steering through a virtual reality computer simulated environment while fixating 
      a point on the road ~2s ahead. Flow was systematically manipulated independent of
      the veridical road edges, so that use of flow would lead to predictable
      understeer or oversteer (the flow speed was altered proportional to veridical
      flow by: .5, .75, 1, 1.25, 1.5). We also varied road edge information by using 7 
      combinations of Near road ('N': up to .5s ahead), Middle road ('M': from .5s to
      1s ahead) and Far road ('F': from 1s to horizon) information. As predicted,
      steering systematically changed according to flow speed, but the magnitude of the
      flow-induced bias varied depending on the road-edge components that were visible.
      The presence of Far road increased the influence of flow, with flow bias most
      evident in F and N+M+F conditions. Similar results were observed when
      participants were free to look where they preferred. It seems that flow
      predominantly interacts with prospective steering control rather than the
      immediate correction of steering errors. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2015.

TI  - Neighbor influence on evacuation behavior in virtual and real environments.
PG  - 409
LID - 10.1167/15.12.409 [doi]
AB  - Virtual reality (VR) enables the study of visually-guided behavior in situations 
      that are otherwise not amenable to laboratory research. An example is a fire
      evacuation scenario, in which building occupants have to find their way to safety
      through smoke and flames, identify safe egress routes, and avoid threats. First, 
      however, it must be determined whether evacuation behavior in VR is comparable to
      that in a real environment. We are thus initially studying participant responses 
      to a fire alarm in matched virtual and real environments. The present experiment 
      investigates how the decision to evacuate is influenced by visual cues about a
      neighbor's behavior. In the Control group, a lone participant is exposed to a
      fire alarm while performing a bogus task. In the Passive group, a participant
      performs the same task with a confederate who ignores the fire alarm. In the
      Active group, the confederate immediately leaves the room when the fire alarm
      sounds. The gender of the participant is crossed with the gender of the
      confederate. 75 participants experience the scenario in a real environment (25
      per group), and 75 others in a matched virtual environment presented in a
      wireless head mounted display (HMD), with avatars of the confederates. In the
      real environment, two-thirds of participants in the Control group evacuated the
      room. In the Active group, nearly all did so, whereas in the Passive group all
      but one did. More female than male participants evacuated in the Control group,
      but there were no other gender effects. Data collection in the virtual
      environment is in progress, and will be completed by spring. The findings thus
      far demonstrate a very strong influence of neighbor behavior on a participant's
      evacuation decision. The results will provide answers to the much-debated
      question of whether evacuation behavior is similar in virtual and real
      environments. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2015.

TI  - Memory in visual search is task-dependent in both 2D and 3D environments.
PG  - 56
LID - 10.1167/15.12.56 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have indicated the effect of memory for both context and targets
      on search in 2D images of naturalistic scenes. However, recent results in 3D
      immersive environments failed to show much effect of context (Li et al., JOV,
      2014). To examine whether this reflects differences between 2D vs. 3D
      environments, we ran a 2D experiment designed to parallel our previous 3D virtual
      reality environment. Subjects viewed 2D snapshots taken from the two rooms in the
      3D immersive environment and then searched those images for a series of targets. 
      The number of fixations required to locate the targets improved rapidly and was
      similar in both 2D and 3D environments. Interestingly, most of the improvement
      reflects learning to choose the correct room to look for a given target. Once in 
      the correct room, search is very rapid and objects were located within 3-5
      fixations in either environment. Previous exposure (one minute) to the context
      did not facilitate subsequent search. This was true for both 2D and 3D. In
      addition, there was little or no effect of experience with the environment on
      subsequent search for contextual objects in the scene. Even after 24 search
      trials, the number of fixations required to locate contextual objects in the room
      was close to values found with no experience. Incidental fixations made during
      previous trials also do not seem to benefit search much (though a small effect is
      detectable). Thus, search in both 2D and 3D environments is very comparable, and 
      the primary effect of experience on search depends on task relevance (i.e.,
      previously searched objects are easily remembered but not otherwise). We
      speculate that the effects of context either require much more extensive
      experience, or else a pre-exposure that immediately precedes the search episode.

AB  - How do we control our bodily movements when socially interacting with others?
      Research on online motor control provides evidence that task relevant visual
      information is used for guiding corrective movements of ongoing motor actions. In
      social interactions observers have been shown to use their own motor system for
      predicting the outcome of another person's action (direct matching hypothesis)
      and it has been suggested that this information is used for the online control of
      their social interactions such as when giving someone a high five. Because only
      human but not non-human (e.g. robot) movements can be simulated within the
      observer's motor system, the human-likeness of the interaction partner should
      affect both the planning and online control of movement execution. We examined
      this hypothesis by investigating the effect of human-likeness of the interaction 
      partner on motor planning and online motor control during natural social
      interactions. To this end, we employed a novel virtual reality paradigm in which 
      participants naturally interacted with a life-sized virtual avatar. While 14
      participants interacted with a human avatar, another 14 participants interacted
      with a robot avatar. All participants were instructed to give a high-five to the 
      avatar. To test for online motor control we randomly perturbed the avatar's hand 
      trajectories during participants' motor execution. Importantly, human and robot
      looking avatars were executing identical movements. We used optical tracking to
      track participants' hand positions. The analysis of hand trajectories showed that
      participants were faster in carrying out the high-five movements with humans than
      with robots suggesting that the human-likeness of the interaction partner indeed 
      affected motor planning. However, there was little evidence for a substantial
      effect of the human-likeness on online motor control. Taken together the results 
      indicate that the human-likeness of the interaction partner influences motor
      planning but not online motor control. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2015.

TI  - More than a cool illusion? Functional significance of self-motion illusion
      (circular vection) for perspective switches.
PG  - 1174
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01174 [doi]
AB  - Self-motion can facilitate perspective switches and "automatic spatial updating" 
      and help reduce disorientation in applications like virtual reality (VR).
      However, providing physical motion through moving-base motion simulators or
      free-space walking areas comes with high cost and technical complexity. This
      study provides first evidence that merely experiencing an embodied illusion of
      self-motion ("circular vection") can provide similar behavioral benefits as
      actual self-motion: Blindfolded participants were asked to imagine facing new
      perspectives in a well-learned room, and point to previously learned objects.
      Merely imagining perspective switches while stationary yielded worst performance.
      When perceiving illusory self-rotation to the novel perspective, however,
      performance improved significantly and yielded performance similar to actual
      rotation. Circular vection was induced by combining rotating sound fields
      ("auditory vection") and biomechanical vection from stepping along a
      carrousel-like rotating floor platter. In sum, illusory self-motion indeed
      facilitated perspective switches and thus spatial orientation, similar to actual 
      self-motion, thus providing first compelling evidence of the functional
      significance and behavioral relevance of vection. This could ultimately enable us
      to complement the prevailing introspective vection measures with behavioral
      indicators, and guide the design for more affordable yet effective VR simulators 
      that intelligently employ multi-modal self-motion illusions to reduce the need
      for costly physical observer motion.

PG  - 1103
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01103 [doi]
AB  - In this large scale, individual differences study (N = 521), the effects of
      cardinal axes of an environment and the path taken between locations on distance 
      comparisons were assessed. The main goal was to identify if and to what extent
      previous findings in simple 2D tasks can be generalized to a more dynamic,
      three-dimensional virtual reality environment. Moreover, effects of age and
      gender were assessed. After memorizing the locations of six objects in a circular
      environment, participants were asked to judge the distance between objects they
      encountered. Results indicate that categorization (based on the cardinal axes)
      was present, as distances within one quadrant were judged as being closer
      together, even when no visual indication of the cardinal axes was given.
      Moreover, strong effects of the path taken between object locations were found;
      objects that were near on the path taken were perceived as being closer together 
      than objects that were further apart on this path, regardless of the metric
      distance between the objects. Males outperformed females in distance comparison, 
      but did not differ in the extent of the categorization and path effects. Age also
      affected performance; the categorization and path effects were highly similar
      across the age range tested, but the general ability to estimate distances does
      show a clear pattern increase during development and decrease with aging.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Virtual reality (VR) is used in the field of
      rehabilitation/physical therapy to improve patients' functional abilities. The
      last 5 years have yielded numerous publications on the use of VR in patients with
      neurological disease which aim to establish whether this therapeutic resource
      contributes to the recovery of motor function. DEVELOPMENT: The following
      databases were reviewed: Cochrane Original, Joanna Briggs Connect,
      Medline/Pubmed, Cinahl, Scopus, Isi Web of Science, and Sport-Discus. We included
      articles published in the last 5 years in English and/or Spanish, focusing on
      using RV to improve motor function in patients with stroke. From this pool, we
      selected 4 systematic reviews and 21 controlled and/or randomised trials. Most
      studies focused on increasing motor function in the upper limbs, and/or improving
      performance of activities of daily living. An additional article examines use of 
      the same technique to increase motor function in the lower limb and/or improve
      walking and static-dynamic balance. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Strong scientific
      evidence supports the beneficial effects of VR on upper limb motor recovery in
      stroke patients. Further studies are needed to fully determine which changes are 
      generated in cortical reorganisation, what type of VR system is the most
      appropriate, whether benefits are maintained in the long term, and which
      frequencies and intensities of treatment are the most suitable.

TI  - An exploration of the ecological validity of the Virtual Action
      Planning-Supermarket (VAP-S) with people with schizophrenia.
PG  - 1-20
AB  - People with schizophrenia often have functional limitations that affect their
      daily activities due to executive function deficits. One way to assess these
      deficits is through the use of virtual reality programmes that reproduce
      real-life instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). One such programme is 
      the Virtual Action Planning-Supermarket (VAP-S). This exploratory study aimed to 
      examine the ecological validity of this programme, specifically, how task
      performance in both virtual and natural environments compares. Case studies were 
      used and involved five participants with schizophrenia, who were familiar with
      grocery shopping. They were assessed during both the VAP-S shopping task and a
      real-life grocery shopping task using an observational assessment tool, the
      Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform (PRPP) System of Task Analysis. The results
      show that when difficulties were present in the virtual task, difficulties were
      also observed in the real-life task. For some participants, greater difficulties 
      were observed in the virtual task. These difficulties could be explained by the
      presence of perceptual deficits and problems remembering the required sequenced
      actions in the virtual task. In conclusion, performance on the VAP-S by these
      five participants was generally comparable to the performance in a natural
      environment.

TI  - "Bicycles May Use Full Lane" Signage Communicates U.S. Roadway Rules and
      Increases Perception of Safety.
PG  - e0136973
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0136973 [doi]
AB  - Many global challenges, including obesity, health care costs, and climate change,
      could be addressed in part by increasing the use of bicycles for transportation. 
      Concern about the safety of bicycling on roadways is frequently cited as a
      deterrent to increasing bicycle use in the USA. The use of effective signage
      along roadways might help alleviate these concerns by increasing knowledge about 
      the rights and duties of bicyclists and motorists, ideally reducing crashes. We
      administered a web-based survey, using Twitter for recruitment, to examine how
      well three US traffic control devices communicated the message that bicyclists
      are permitted in the center of the travel lane and do not have to "get out of the
      way" to allow motorists to pass without changing lanes: "Bicycles May Use Full
      Lane" and "Share the Road" signage, and Shared Lane Markings on the pavement.
      Each was compared to an unsigned roadway. We also asked respondents whether it
      was safe for a bicyclist to occupy the center of the travel lane. "Bicycles May
      Use Full Lane" signage was the most consistently comprehended device for
      communicating the message that bicyclists may occupy the travel lane and also
      increased perceptions of safety. "Share the Road" signage did not increase
      comprehension or perceptions of safety. Shared Lane Markings fell somewhere
      between. "Bicycles May Use Full Lane" signage showed notable increases in
      comprehension among novice bicyclists and private motor vehicle commuters,
      critical target audiences for efforts to promote bicycling in the USA. Although
      limited in scope, our survey results are indicative and suggest that Departments 
      of Transportation consider replacing "Share the Road" with "Bicycles May Use Full
      Lane" signage, possibly combined with Shared Lane Markings, if the intent is to
      increase awareness of roadway rights and responsibilities. Further evaluation
      through virtual reality simulations and on-road experiments is merited.

TI  - Does multicomponent physical exercise with simultaneous cognitive training boost 
      cognitive performance in older adults? A 6-month randomized controlled trial with
      a 1-year follow-up.
PG  - 1335-49
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S87732 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is a health problem that concerns almost every
      second elderly person. Physical and cognitive training have differential positive
      effects on cognition, but have been rarely applied in combination. This study
      evaluates synergistic effects of multicomponent physical exercise complemented
      with novel simultaneous cognitive training on cognition in older adults. We
      hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive-physical components would add training
      specific cognitive benefits compared to exclusively physical training. METHODS:
      Seniors, older than 70 years, without cognitive impairment, were randomly
      assigned to either: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill
      walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill
      walking (PHYS). Each program was complemented with strength and balance
      exercises. Two 1-hour training sessions per week over 6 months were applied.
      Cognitive performance was assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6 months, and at
      1-year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were
      calculated. RESULTS: Eighty-nine participants were randomized to the three groups
      initially, 71 completed the training, while 47 were available at 1-year
      follow-up. Advantages of the simultaneous cognitive-physical programs were found 
      in two dimensions of executive function. "Shifting attention" showed a
      timexintervention interaction in favor of DANCE/MEMORY versus PHYS (F[2, 68]
      =1.95, trend P=0.075, r=0.17); and "working memory" showed a timexintervention
      interaction in favor of DANCE versus MEMORY (F[1, 136] =2.71, trend P=0.051, R
      (2)=0.006). Performance improvements in executive functions, long-term visual
      memory (episodic memory), and processing speed were maintained at follow-up in
      all groups. CONCLUSION: Particular executive functions benefit from simultaneous 
      cognitive-physical training compared to exclusively physical multicomponent
      training. Cognitive-physical training programs may counteract widespread
      cognitive impairments in the elderly.

TI  - Augmented Reality Guidance for the Resection of Missing Colorectal Liver
      Metastases: An Initial Experience.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern chemotherapy achieves the shrinking of colorectal cancer liver
      metastases (CRLM) to such extent that they may disappear from radiological
      imaging. Disappearing CRLM rarely represents a complete pathological remission
      and have an important risk of recurrence. Augmented reality (AR) consists in the 
      fusion of real-time patient images with a computer-generated 3D virtual patient
      model created from pre-operative medical imaging. The aim of this prospective
      pilot study is to investigate the potential of AR navigation as a tool to help
      locate and surgically resect missing CRLM. METHODS: A 3D virtual anatomical model
      was created from thoracoabdominal CT-scans using customary software (VR
      RENDER(R), IRCAD). The virtual model was superimposed to the operative field
      using an Exoscope (VITOM(R), Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). Virtual and real
      images were manually registered in real-time using a video mixer, based on
      external anatomical landmarks with an estimated accuracy of 5 mm. This modality
      was tested in three patients, with four missing CRLM that had sizes from 12 to 24
      mm, undergoing laparotomy after receiving pre-operative oxaliplatin-based
      chemotherapy. RESULTS: AR display and fine registration was performed within 6
      min. AR helped detect all four missing CRLM, and guided their resection. In all
      cases the planned security margin of 1 cm was clear and resections were confirmed
      to be R0 by pathology. There was no postoperative major morbidity or mortality.
      No local recurrence occurred in the follow-up period of 6-22 months. CONCLUSIONS:
      This initial experience suggests that AR may be a helpful navigation tool for the
      resection of missing CRLM.

AB  - Kinetic outcomes are an essential part of clinical gait analysis, and can be
      collected for many consecutive strides using instrumented treadmills. However,
      the validity of treadmill kinetic outcomes has not been demonstrated for children
      with cerebral palsy (CP). In this study we compared ground reaction forces (GRF),
      center of pressure, and hip, knee and ankle moments, powers and work, between
      overground (OG) and self-paced treadmill (TM) walking for 11 typically developing
      (TD) children and 9 children with spastic CP. Considerable differences were found
      in several outcome parameters. In TM, subjects demonstrated lower ankle power
      generation and more absorption, and increased hip moments and work. This shift
      from ankle to hip strategy was likely due to a more backward positioning of the
      hip and a slightly more forward trunk lean. In mediolateral direction, GRF and
      hip and knee joint moments were increased in TM due to wider step width. These
      findings indicate that kinetic data collected on a TM cannot be readily compared 
      with OG data in TD children and children with CP, and that treadmill-specific
      normative data sets should be used when performing kinetic gait analysis on a
      treadmill.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of drivers over 65years of age continues to increase.
      Although neck rotation range has been identified as a factor associated with
      self-reported crash history in older drivers, it was not consistently reported as
      indicators of older driver performance or crashes across previous studies. It is 
      likely that drivers use neck and trunk rotation when driving, and therefore the
      functional range of motion (ROM) (i.e. overall rotation used during a task) of
      older drivers should be further examined. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate older driver
      performance in an immersive virtual reality, simulated, dynamic driving blind
      spot target detection task. METHODS: A cross-sectional laboratory study recruited
      twenty-six licensed drivers (14 young between 18 and 35years, and 12 older
      between 65 to 75years) from the local community. Participants were asked to
      detect targets by performing blind spot check movements while neck and trunk
      rotation was tracked. Functional ROM, target detection success, and time to
      detection were analyzed. RESULTS: In addition to neck rotation, older and younger
      drivers on average rotated their trunks 9.96 degrees and 18.04 degrees ,
      respectively. The younger drivers generally demonstrated 15.6 degrees greater
      functional ROM (p<.001), were nearly twice as successful in target detection due 
      to target location (p=.008), and had 0.46s less target detection time (p=.016)
      than the older drivers. CONCLUSION: Assessing older driver functional ROM may
      provide more comprehensive assessment of driving ability than neck ROM. Target
      detection success and time to detection may also be part of the aging process as 
      these measures differed between driver groups.

AB  - [Purpose] This study aimed to assess the effect of a virtual reality exercise
      program accompanied by cognitive tasks on the balance and gait of stroke
      patients. [Subjects] Twenty stroke patients were randomly assigned to two groups 
      10 to an experimental group that performed a virtual reality exercise program
      accompanied by cognitive tasks and 10 to a control group. The control group
      performed a proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercise program. Balance
      was measured with the Berg Balance Scale. Gait was assessed using the Timed Up
      and Go Test. The paired t-test was used to compare groups before and after the
      experiment. The independent t-test was conducted to assess differences in the
      degree of change between the two groups before and after the experiment.
      [Results] Within-group comparison in the experimental group showed significant
      differences in the Berg Balance Scale and Timed Up and Go Test. In a comparison
      between groups, the differences in the Berg Balance Scale and Timed Up and Go
      Test in the experimental group appeared significant compared with the control
      group. [Conclusion] The results of the experiment indicate that a virtual reality
      exercise program accompanied by cognitive tasks has a positive effect on the
      balance and gait of stroke patients.

AB  - [Purpose] The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of conventional
      neurological treatment and a virtual reality training program on eye-hand
      coordination in children with cerebral palsy. [Subjects] Sixteen children (9
      males, 7 females) with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy were recruited and
      randomly assigned to the conventional neurological physical therapy group (CG)
      and virtual reality training group (VRG). [Methods] Eight children in the control
      group performed 45 minutes of therapeutic exercise twice a week for eight weeks. 
      In the experimental group, the other eight children performed 30 minutes of
      therapeutic exercise and 15 minutes of a training program using virtual reality
      twice a week during the experimental period. [Results] After eight weeks of the
      training program, there were significant differences in eye-hand coordination and
      visual motor speed in the comparison of the virtual reality training group with
      the conventional neurological physical therapy group. [Conclusion] We conclude
      that a well-designed training program using virtual reality can improve eye-hand 
      coordination in children with cerebral palsy.

      performed training using the Xbox Kinect. ETG performed training using an
      ergometer bicycle. Both groups received training 30 min per day, five times per
      week, for eight weeks. [Results] Both the VRG and ETG subjects exhibited a
      significant difference in weight distribution ratio on the paralyzed side and
      balance ability. Both the VRG and ETG patients showed significant improvement in 
      psychological measures BDI and RCS, after the intervention, and the VRG sowed a
      more significant increase in BDI than the ETG. [Conclusion] According to the
      result of this study, virtual reality training and ergometer training were both
      effective at improving balance, gait abilities, depression, and interpersonal
      relationships among stroke patients.

LID - S0028-3932(15)30138-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.08.022 [doi]
AB  - Social interactions depend on mechanisms such as the ability to take another
      person's viewpoint, i.e. visuo-spatial perspective taking. However, little is
      known about the sensorimotor mechanisms underpinning perspective taking. Because 
      vestibular signals play roles in mental rotation and spatial cognition tasks and 
      because damage to the vestibular cortex can disturb egocentric perspective,
      vestibular signals stand as important candidates for the sensorimotor foundations
      of perspective taking. Yet, no study merged natural full-body vestibular
      stimulations and explicit visuo-spatial perspective taking tasks in virtual
      environments. In Experiment 1, we combined natural vestibular stimulation on a
      rotatory chair with virtual reality to test how vestibular signals are processed 
      to simulate the viewpoint of a distant avatar. While they were rotated,
      participants tossed a ball to a virtual character from the viewpoint of a distant
      avatar. Our results showed that vestibular signals influence perspective taking
      in a direction-specific way: participants were faster when their physical body
      rotated in the same direction as the mental rotation needed to take the avatar's 
      viewpoint. In Experiment 2, participants realized 3D object mental rotations,
      which did not involve perspective taking, during the same whole-body vestibular
      stimulation. Our results demonstrated that vestibular stimulation did not affect 
      3D object mental rotations. Altogether, these data indicate that vestibular
      signals have a direction-specific influence on visuo-spatial perspective taking
      (self-centered mental imagery), but not a general effect on mental imagery.
      Findings from this study suggest that vestibular signals contribute to one of the
      most crucial mechanisms of social cognition: understanding others' actions.

AB  - [Purpose] This study investigated the therapeutic effects of virtual
      reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training on brain activity in patients
      with stroke. [Subjects and Methods] Eighteen chronic stroke patients were divided
      into two groups: the virtual reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training
      group (n = 10) and the bilateral upper-limb training group (n = 8). The virtual
      reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training group performed bilateral
      upper-extremity exercises in a virtual reality environment, while the bilateral
      upper-limb training group performed only bilateral upper-extremity exercise. All 
      training was conducted 30 minutes per day, three times per week for six weeks,
      followed by brain activity evaluation. [Results] Electroencephalography showed
      significant increases in concentration in the frontopolar 2 and frontal 4 areas, 
      and significant increases in brain activity in the frontopolar 1 and frontal 3
      areas in the virtual reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training group.
      [Conclusion] Virtual reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training can improve
      the brain activity of stroke patients. Thus, virtual reality-based bilateral
      upper-extremity training is feasible and beneficial for improving brain
      activation in stroke patients.

TI  - Structure Learning in Bayesian Sensorimotor Integration.
PG  - e1004369
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004369 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have shown that sensorimotor processing can often be described
      by Bayesian learning, in particular the integration of prior and feedback
      information depending on its degree of reliability. Here we test the hypothesis
      that the integration process itself can be tuned to the statistical structure of 
      the environment. We exposed human participants to a reaching task in a
      three-dimensional virtual reality environment where we could displace the visual 
      feedback of their hand position in a two dimensional plane. When introducing
      statistical structure between the two dimensions of the displacement, we found
      that over the course of several days participants adapted their feedback
      integration process in order to exploit this structure for performance
      improvement. In control experiments we found that this adaptation process
      critically depended on performance feedback and could not be induced by verbal
      instructions. Our results suggest that structural learning is an important
      meta-learning component of Bayesian sensorimotor integration.

LID - 10.1016/j.bbr.2015.08.017 [doi]
AB  - Postural control is a complex dynamic mechanism, which integrates information
      from visual, vestibular and somatosensory systems. Idiopathic Parkinson's disease
      (IPD) patients are unable to produce appropriate reflexive responses to changing 
      environmental conditions. Still, it is controversial what is due to voluntary or 
      involuntary postural control, even less what is the effect of levodopa. We aimed 
      to evaluate compensatory postural adjustments (CPA), with kinematic and
      time-frequency analyzes, and further understand the role of dopaminergic
      medication on these processes. 19 healthy subjects (Controls) and 15 idiopathic
      Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients in the OFF and ON medication states, wearing
      IMUs, were submitted to a virtual reality scenario with visual downward
      displacements on a staircase. We also hypothesized if CPA would involve
      mechanisms occurring in distinct time scales. We subsequently analyzed postural
      adjustments on two frequency bands: low components between 0.3 and 1.5Hz (LB),
      and high components between 1.5 and 3.5Hz (HB). Vertical acceleration
      demonstrated a greater power for discriminating IPD patients from healthy
      subjects. Visual perturbation significantly increased the power of the HB in all 
      groups, being particularly more evident in the OFF state. Levodopa significantly 
      increased their basal power taking place on the LB. However, controls and IPD
      patients in the ON state revealed a similar trend of the control mechanism.
      Results indicate an improvement in muscular stiffness provided by levodopa. They 
      also suggest the role of different compensatory postural adjustment patterns,
      with LB being related to inertial properties of the oscillating mass and HB
      representing reactions to the ongoing visual input-changing scenario.

TI  - Current state of virtual reality simulation in robotic surgery training: a
      review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the annual number of robotic surgical procedures continues
      to increase. Robotic surgical skills are unique from those used in either open or
      laparoscopic surgery. The acquisition of a basic robotic surgical skill set may
      be best accomplished in the simulation laboratory. We sought to review the
      current literature pertaining to the use of virtual reality (VR) simulation in
      the acquisition of robotic surgical skills on the da Vinci Surgical System.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted between December 2014 and
      January 2015 utilizing the following keywords: virtual reality, robotic surgery, 
      da Vinci, da Vinci skills simulator, SimSurgery Educational Platform, Mimic
      dV-Trainer, and Robotic Surgery Simulator. Articles were included if they were
      published between 2007 and 2015, utilized VR simulation for the da Vinci Surgical
      System, and utilized a commercially available VR platform. RESULTS: The initial
      search criteria returned 227 published articles. After all inclusion and
      exclusion criteria were applied, a total of 47 peer-reviewed manuscripts were
      included in the final review. CONCLUSIONS: There are many benefits to utilizing
      VR simulation for robotic skills acquisition. Four commercially available
      simulators have been demonstrated to be capable of assessing robotic skill. Three
      of the four simulators demonstrate the ability of a VR training curriculum to
      improve basic robotic skills, with proficiency-based training being the most
      effective training style. The skills obtained on a VR training curriculum are
      comparable with those obtained on dry laboratory simulation. The future of VR
      simulation includes utilization in assessment for re-credentialing purposes,
      advanced procedural-based training, and as a warm-up tool prior to surgery.

TI  - Usability and acceptability of balance exergames in older adults: A scoping
      review.
LID - 1460458215598638 [pii]
AB  - Serious games (exergames) have the potential to be effective for postural balance
      and increasing muscle strength. Several games have been developed to increase
      physical fitness and balance among older adults. However, it is unclear to which 
      degree usability and acceptability of exergames for older adults have been
      evaluated. The aim of this study was to summarize usability evaluation and
      acceptability of studies in older adults. We conducted a scoping review on
      studies focusing on usability of exergames for older adults. The result shows
      that older adults consider usability and acceptability of exercise video games
      good. The review shows that longitudinal studies mainly use off-the-shelf
      exergame and evaluated game effectiveness and acceptability, whereas
      cross-sectional studies focus on interactional experience. Studies varied in
      their approaches to measure usability and acceptability of exergames for older
      adults. There is a need for a systematic developmental approach to involve older 
      adults in development of exergames for longitudinal studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effectiveness of the video game console Nintendo Wii 
      (NW) in motor function, balance, and functional independence in the treatment of 
      poststroke patients and to identify which games are commonly used in therapy.
      METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were researched in MEDLINE, Cochrane
      Library, PEDro, CAPES Periodic, BIREME, and LILACS databases, covering
      publications up to March 31, 2014. The assessment of methodological quality was
      performed using the PEDro Scale as reference. RESULTS: The 5 studies included for
      analysis showed that NW can provide an improvement of motor function of the
      individual, but the data are unclear when it comes to the balance and functional 
      independence. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that there is little evidence to
      ensure the effectiveness and support the inclusion of the treatment with NW in
      patients with sequelae caused by a stroke; however, some of the studies analyzed 
      suggest that NW can provide improvement in motor function.

      and multi sensory approach to Vestibular Physical Therapy - a case study.
PG  - 106
LID - 10.3389/fnsys.2015.00106 [doi]
AB  - This paper discusses a case study of a 41-year-old active duty male service
      member who sustained head trauma from a motorcycle accident and underwent
      multidisciplinary vestibular physical therapy rehabilitation. He was initially
      treated with traditional physical therapy applications of treadmill walking and
      standing balance with some symptom improvements, but was not able to maintain a
      running speed that would allow him to return to full active duty status. Further 
      treatment utilizing a Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment was performed 
      in order to increase level of difficulty and further enhance function. This
      treatment is able to elicit vestibular deficits seen in the community as it
      requires subjects to walk and balance while performing tasks within a virtual
      scenario incorporating platform motion, visual surround and flow, and cognitive
      processing. After 6 weeks of therapy, twice weekly, improvements in clinical
      vestibular measures were observed as well as walking speed and patient
      confidence. The patient was able to return to full duty after treatment. This
      case study provides supportive evidence that multidimensional tasking in a
      virtual environment provides a safe but demanding form of vestibular therapy for 
      patients needing more challenging tasks than those provided with traditional
      therapy techniques. Those persons requiring higher levels of performance before
      returning to full duty (e.g., pilots, special operators, etc.) may find this type
      of therapy beneficial.

TI  - Body ownership and response to threat.
AB  - A virtual-reality setup was used to investigate the relationship between
      perceived body ownership and subjective anxiety, as assessed by an anxiety
      inventory (SA-I). A pilot study confirmed that synchrony between the
      participant's real hand movements and the movements of a virtual effector induced
      perceived ownership illusions. The illusions were comparable for virtual human
      hands and virtual cat claws, even though the overall acceptance was greater for
      human hands. In Experiment 1, participants used the virtual effector to collect
      coins and avoid knives descending on a screen before anxiety was measured. The
      level of anxiety increased with synchrony and was higher for human hands than for
      cat claws, but these two effects were independent. Experiment 2 separated effects
      of coin catching and knife avoiding by means of a between-participant design. The
      outcome of Experiment 1 was replicated in the knife-avoiding task but not in the 
      coin-catching task, in which anxiety levels were low and not systematically
      affected by the type of virtual effector. Taken altogether, our findings suggest 
      that subjective anxiety and ownership are strongly related.

TI  - Virtual Reality in Assessing the Supportive Environment that Promotes
      Navigability of Persons with Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 951-6
AB  - Spatial cognition and representation in persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
      usually impaired, alongside with cognitive impairment. It is important to provide
      the supportive environments that support their ability of wayfinding to maintain 
      the daily activities and autonomy. The aim of this paper is to emphasize how
      Virtual Reality (VR) system is used to assess the improved environmental design
      that promotes spatial navigability in persons with AD. The importance of
      supportive environments and significant studies that used VR in the wayfinding
      interventions is presented. The paper proposed a strategy to use Virtual
      Environment (VE), replacing the traditional assessment in the design development 
      phase of supportive environment. Results from the preliminary valuation using
      interview show positive feedback by the medical experts, since immersive VE
      allows the experience being in actual environment. Also, the proposed strategy
      may reduce the costly and time-consuming design process. An evidence-based
      validation involving persons with AD will be conducted to investigate the
      effectiveness of this assessment strategy by comparing the individuals'
      navigational performances in both real and VE.

TI  - Eye-tracking and EMG supported 3D Virtual Reality - an integrated tool for
      perceptual and motor development of children with severe physical disabilities: a
      research concept.
PG  - 840-6
AB  - Letting children with severe physical disabilities (like Tetraparesis spastica)
      to get relevant motional experiences of appropriate quality and quantity is now
      the greatest challenge for us in the field of neurorehabilitation. These motional
      experiences may establish many cognitive processes, but may also cause additional
      secondary cognitive dysfunctions such as disorders in body image, figure
      invariance, visual perception, auditory differentiation, concentration, analytic 
      and synthetic ways of thinking, visual memory etc. Virtual Reality is a
      technology that provides a sense of presence in a real environment with the help 
      of 3D pictures and animations formed in a computer environment and enable the
      person to interact with the objects in that environment. One of our biggest
      challenges is to find a well suited input device (hardware) to let the children
      with severe physical disabilities to interact with the computer. Based on our own
      experiences and a thorough literature review we have come to the conclusion that 
      an effective combination of eye-tracking and EMG devices should work well.

TI  - Developing movement recognition application with the use of Shimmer sensor and
      Microsoft Kinect sensor.
PG  - 767-72
AB  - Nowadays the development of virtual reality-based application is one of the most 
      dynamically growing areas. These applications have a wide user base, more and
      more devices which are providing several kinds of user interactions and are
      available on the market. In the applications where the not-handheld devices are
      not necessary, the potential is that these can be used in educational,
      entertainment and rehabilitation applications. The purpose of this paper is to
      examine the precision and the efficiency of the not-handheld devices with user
      interaction in the virtual reality-based applications. The first task of the
      developed application is to support the rehabilitation process of stroke patients
      in their homes. A newly developed application will be introduced in this paper,
      which uses the two popular devices, the Shimmer sensor and the Microsoft Kinect
      sensor. To identify and to validate the actions of the user these sensors are
      working together in parallel mode. For the problem solving, the application is
      available to record an educational pattern, and then the software compares this
      pattern to the action of the user. The goal of the current research is to examine
      the extent of the difference in the recognition of the gestures, how precisely
      the two sensors are identifying the predefined actions. This could affect the
      rehabilitation process of the stroke patients and influence the efficiency of the
      rehabilitation. This application was developed in C# programming language and
      uses the original Shimmer connecting application as a base. During the working of
      this application it is possible to teach five-five different movements with the
      use of the Shimmer and the Microsoft Kinect sensors. The application can
      recognize these actions at any later time. This application uses a file-based
      database and the runtime memory of the application to store the saved data in
      order to reach the actions easier. The conclusion is that much more precise data 
      were collected from the Microsoft Kinect sensor than the Shimmer sensors.

TI  - ICT based technology to support play for children with severe physical
      disabilities.
PG  - 573-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Play is important for a child's development. Children with severe
      physical disabilities experience difficulties engaging in play. With the progress
      of technology the possibilities to support play are increasing. The purpose of
      this review was to gain insight into the possibilities and availability of ICT
      based technology to support play in children with severe physical disabilities.
      METHODS: A systematic literature search within the databases PubMed, CINAHL, IEEE
      and ERIC was carried out. Three reviewers assessed titles and abstracts
      independently. Additionally, Google Scholar, conference proceedings and reference
      lists were used. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The included publications reported on 27
      different technologies, which can be classified into three main groups; robots,
      virtual reality systems and computer systems. There are several options that may 
      have great potential in supporting play for this target group.

AB  - Caregiving interest in men (N=46) during the third trimester of their partner's
      pregnancy was examined. The study included both explicit and implicit measures of
      caregiving interest, assessments of basal urinary concentrations of oxytocin and 
      vasopressin, and exogenous (intranasal) application of these hormones. Compared
      to control men (N=20), fathers-to-be reported more interest in direct care for
      children. In an immersive virtual environment, fathers-to-be, in comparison to
      control men, stood closer to and tended to spend more time looking at the
      baby-related avatars, and stood further away and tended to spend less time
      looking at non-baby-related avatars. Basal oxytocin and vasopressin were not
      related to caregiving interest in fathers-to-be, and were not different from
      control men. When vasopressin was administered, fathers-to-be invested more time 
      watching the baby-related avatars compared to control men. No effects were found 
      of exogenous oxytocin on the behavior of fathers-to-be and control men in the
      immersive virtual environment. These results point in the direction of an
      adjustment of fathers-to-be for fatherhood, both consciously and unconsciously,
      and support the possible role of vasopressin in human behavior in the transition 
      to fatherhood.

AB  - The present review is focused on the randomized controlled trials and
      meta-analyses in the field of technological means for neurorehabilitation. The
      available literature data and the results of original observations provide a
      basis for distinguishing between the following levels of evidence: instrumental
      verticalization--2a, robot-assisted mechanotherapy--1a, biological feedback--1a, 
      virtual reality--1a, transcranial magnetic stimulation--1a for central
      hemiparesis and 1b for speech disturbance and unilateral spatial agnosia,
      transcranial electrical stimulation--2b, electromyostimulation--1a,
      telerehabilitation--3. It is concluded that the use of the innovative
      technologies for the purpose of neurorehabiltation is objectively substantiated. 
      Further investigations are needed to allow their application on an individual
      basis.

TI  - A central role for the retrosplenial cortex in de novo environmental learning.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.09031 [doi]
AB  - With experience we become accustomed to the types of environments that we
      normally encounter as we navigate in the world. But how does this fundamental
      knowledge develop in the first place and what brain regions are involved? To
      examine de novo environmental learning, we created an 'alien' virtual reality
      world populated with landmarks of which participants had no prior experience.
      They learned about this environment by moving within it during functional MRI
      (fMRI) scanning while we tracked their evolving knowledge. Retrosplenial cortex
      (RSC) played a central and highly selective role by representing only the most
      stable, permanent features in this world. Subsequently, increased coupling was
      noted between RSC and hippocampus, with hippocampus then expressing knowledge of 
      permanent landmark locations and overall environmental layout. Studying how
      environmental representations emerge from scratch provided a new window into the 
      information processing underpinning the brain's navigation system, highlighting
      the key influence of the RSC.

LID - 10.3389/fneur.2015.00164 [doi]
AB  - EXPERIMENTAL OBJECTIVE: To provide a safe, simple, relatively inexpensive, fast, 
      accurate way of quantifying balance performance either in isolation, or in the
      face of challenges provided by 3D high definition moving visual stimuli as well
      as by the proprioceptive challenge from standing on a foam pad. This method uses 
      the new technology of the Wii balance board to measure postural stability during 
      powerful, realistic visual challenges from immersive virtual reality. LIMITATIONS
      OF CURRENT TECHNIQUES: Present computerized methods for measuring postural
      stability are large, complex, slow, and expensive, and do not allow for testing
      the response to realistic visual challenges. PROTOCOL: Subjects stand on a 6 cm
      thick, firm, foam pad on a Wii balance board. They wear a fast, high resolution, 
      low persistence, virtual reality head set (Oculus Rift DK2). This allows displays
      of varying speed, direction, depth, and complexity to be delivered. The subject
      experiences a visual illusion of real objects fixed relative to the world, and
      any of these displays can be perturbed in an unpredictable fashion. A special app
      (BalanceRite) used the same procedures for analyzing postural analysis as used by
      the Equitest. POWER OF THE TECHNIQUE: Four simple "proof of concept" experiments 
      demonstrate that this technique matches the gold standard Equitest in terms of
      the measurement of postural stability but goes beyond the Equitest by measuring
      stability in the face of visual challenges, which are so powerful that even
      healthy subjects fall. The response to these challenges presents an opportunity
      for predicting falls and for rehabilitation of seniors and patients with poor
      postural stability. SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE FIELD: This new method provides a
      simpler, quicker, cheaper method of measurement than the Equitest. It may provide
      a new mode of training to prevent falls, by maintaining postural stability in the
      face of visual and proprioceptive challenges similar to those encountered in
      life.

      minutes of virtual reality simulation training using a haptic transvaginal
      simulator versus 40 minutes of conventional teaching including a conference with 
      slides and videos and answers to the students' questions. The outcome was a
      19-point image quality score calculated from a set of 4 images (sagittal and
      coronal views of the uterus and left and right ovaries) produced by trainees
      immediately after the intervention, using the same simulator on which a new
      virtual patient had been uploaded. Experts assessed the outcome on stored images,
      presented in a random order, 2 months after the trial was completed. They were
      blinded to group assignment. The hypothesis was an improved outcome in the
      intervention group. Randomization was 1 to 1. RESULTS: The mean score was
      significantly greater in the simulation group (n = 16; mean score, 12; SEM, 0.8) 
      than the control group (n = 18; mean score, 9; SEM, 1.0; P= .0302). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The quality of virtual vaginal images produced by inexperienced trainees was
      greater immediately after a single virtual reality simulation training session
      than after a single theoretical teaching session.

TI  - [THE ROLE OF SIMULATION IN SURGICAL TRAINING--A NEW ERA].
PG  - 398-403
AB  - Surgical training, which was traditionally based on the apprentice model, is
      undergoing a fundamental change since the introduction of virtual reality
      simulators into the training program of surgical residents. With the introduction
      of these simulators we can expect to see an improvement in the surgical abilities
      of new surgeons and a decrease in costs--as seen in the aviation world. Virtual
      reality simulators include a visual and tactile interface which is meant to train
      young surgeons in full procedure before the actual surgery. The available
      operation encompasses a multitude of surgical disciplines--gynecology, urology,
      orthopedics, vascular surgery, general surgery and more. The simulator allows the
      surgeon to practice complicated procedures and to be exposed to emergency
      situations without risking the patient's life. We opened in the Carmel Medical
      Center a multi disciplinary simulation center 18 months ago. The center includes 
      simulators for gynecology, orthopedics, urology, general surgery, vascular
      surgery and advanced cardiac life support. The center cooperates with the Faculty
      of Medicine at the Technion in order to train young surgeons in all surgical
      disciplines. In this period of time we followed the improvement in the endoscopic
      abilities of the basic skills course participants.

TI  - Home-based virtual reality balance training and conventional balance training in 
      Parkinson's disease: A randomized controlled trial.

LID - 10.1016/j.jfma.2015.07.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Virtual reality has the advantage to provide rich sensory
      feedbacks for training balance function. This study tested if the home-based
      virtual reality balance training is more effective than the conventional home
      balance training in improving balance, walking, and quality of life in patients
      with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Twenty-three patients with idiopathic PD 
      were recruited and underwent twelve 50-minute training sessions during the 6-week
      training period. The experimental group (n = 11) was trained with a custom-made
      virtual reality balance training system, and the control group (n = 12) was
      trained by a licensed physical therapist. Outcomes were measured at Week 0
      (pretest), Week 6 (posttest), and Week 8 (follow-up). The primary outcome was the
      Berg Balance Scale. The secondary outcomes included the Dynamic Gait Index, timed
      Up-and-Go test, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire, and the motor score of the
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. RESULTS: The experimental and control
      groups were comparable at pretest. After training, both groups performed better
      in the Berg Balance Scale, Dynamic Gait Index, timed Up-and-Go test, and
      Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire at posttest and follow-up than at pretest.
      However, no significant differences were found between these two groups at
      posttest and follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study did not find any difference
      between the effects of the home-based virtual reality balance training and
      conventional home balance training. The two training options were equally
      effective in improving balance, walking, and quality of life among
      community-dwelling patients with PD.

TI  - Insects modify their behaviour depending on the feedback sensor used when walking
      on a trackball in virtual reality.
PG  - 3118-27
LID - 10.1242/jeb.125617 [doi]
AB  - When using virtual-reality paradigms to study animal behaviour, careful attention
      must be paid to how the animal's actions are detected. This is particularly
      relevant in closed-loop experiments where the animal interacts with a stimulus.
      Many different sensor types have been used to measure aspects of behaviour, and
      although some sensors may be more accurate than others, few studies have examined
      whether, and how, such differences affect an animal's behaviour in a closed-loop 
      experiment. To investigate this issue, we conducted experiments with tethered
      honeybees walking on an air-supported trackball and fixating a visual object in
      closed-loop. Bees walked faster and along straighter paths when the motion of the
      trackball was measured in the classical fashion - using optical motion sensors
      repurposed from computer mice - than when measured more accurately using a
      computer vision algorithm called 'FicTrac'. When computer mouse sensors were used
      to measure bees' behaviour, the bees modified their behaviour and achieved
      improved control of the stimulus. This behavioural change appears to be a
      response to a systematic error in the computer mouse sensor that reduces the
      sensitivity of this sensor system under certain conditions. Although the large
      perceived inertia and mass of the trackball relative to the honeybee is a
      limitation of tethered walking paradigms, observing differences depending on the 
      sensor system used to measure bee behaviour was not expected. This study suggests
      that bees are capable of fine-tuning their motor control to improve the outcome
      of the task they are performing. Further, our findings show that caution is
      required when designing virtual-reality experiments, as animals can potentially
      respond to the artificial scenario in unexpected and unintended ways.

LID - S0920-9964(15)00416-8 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The experience of social defeat may increase the risk of developing
      psychotic symptoms and psychotic disorders. We studied the relationship between
      social defeat and paranoid appraisal in people at high risk for psychosis in an
      experimental social environment created using Virtual Reality (VR). METHOD: We
      recruited UHR (N=64) participants and healthy volunteers (N=43). Regression
      analysis was used to investigate which baseline measures predicted paranoid
      appraisals during the VR experience. RESULTS: At baseline, UHR subjects reported 
      significantly higher levels of social defeat than controls (OR=.957, (CI)
      .941-.973, p<.000). Following exposure to the VR social environment, the UHR
      group reported significantly more paranoid appraisals than the controls (p<.000).
      Within the UHR sample, paranoid appraisals were predicted by the level of social 
      defeat at baseline, as well as by the severity of positive psychotic and
      disorganised symptoms. CONCLUSION: In people who are at high risk of psychosis, a
      history of social defeat is associated with an increased likelihood of making
      paranoid appraisals of social interactions. This is consistent with the notion
      that social defeat increases the risk of developing psychosis.

TI  - Substance Use, Bullying, and Body Image Disturbances in Adolescents and Young
      Adults Under the Prism of a 3D Simulation Program: Validation of MySchool4web.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of virtual reality or three-dimensional (3D) simulation
      programs has been explored in different mental health problems and contexts. One 
      of the applications that showed evidence of a suitable assessment for behavioral 
      and emotional problems in adolescents is the 3D questionnaire called
      MySchool4web. The aim of this work was to analyze the psychometric properties of 
      a tailored version of MySchool4web. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A correlational,
      nonexperimental, cross-sectional study was carried out. The participants were 668
      secondary students from schools in Santiago, Chile with a mean age of 15.74
      years. Adolescents completed MySchool4web in the informatics classroom of each
      school. RESULTS: Results indicated that two of the items had to be removed, and a
      three-factor solution was found representing the dimensions substance use,
      bullying, and body image. This final model of 10 items showed acceptable internal
      consistency per factor, and its scores were significantly associated with other
      related measures in nine items. CONCLUSIONS: These outcomes suggest that this
      version of MySchool4web is a reliable and valid measure of a 3D instrument for
      the screening of risky behaviors and emotional problems in adolescents and young 
      adults in a school context.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-agency (SA) is a person's feeling that his action was generated 
      by himself. The neural substrates of SA have been investigated in many
      neuroimaging studies, but the functional connectivity of identified regions has
      rarely been investigated. The goal of this study is to investigate the neural
      network related to SA. METHODS: SA of hand movements was modulated with virtual
      reality. We examined the cortical network relating to SA modulation with
      electroencephalography (EEG) power spectrum and phase coherence of alpha, beta,
      and gamma frequency bands in 16 right-handed, healthy volunteers. RESULTS: In the
      alpha band, significant relative power changes and phase coherence of alpha band 
      were associated with SA modulation. The relative power decrease over the central,
      bilateral parietal, and right temporal regions (C4, Pz, P3, P4, T6) became larger
      as participants more effectively controlled the virtual hand movements. The phase
      coherence of the alpha band within frontal areas (F7-FP2, F7-Fz) was directly
      related to changes in SA. The functional connectivity was lower as the
      participants felt that they could control their virtual hand. In the other
      frequency bands, significant phase coherences were observed in the frontal (or
      central) to parietal, temporal, and occipital regions during SA modulation
      (Fz-O1, F3-O1, Cz-O1, C3-T4L in beta band; FP1-T6, FP1-O2, F7-T4L, F8-Cz in gamma
      band). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that alpha band activity may be the main
      neural oscillation of SA, which suggests that the neural network within the
      anterior frontal area may be important in the generation of SA.

      environments.
PG  - 2242-8
LID - 10.1152/jn.00350.2015 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies on visuomotor processes using virtual setups have suggested that
      actions are affected by similar biases as perceptual tasks. In particular, a
      strong lack of depth constancy is revealed, resembling biases in perceptual
      estimates of relative depth. With this study we aim to understand whether these
      findings are mostly caused by a lack of metric accuracy of the visuomotor system 
      or by the limited cues provided by the use of virtual reality. We addressed this 
      issue by comparing grasping movements towards a spherical object located at four 
      distances (420, 450, 480, and 510 mm) performed in three conditions: 1) virtual, 
      in which the target was a virtual object defined by binocular cues, 2)
      glow-in-the-dark, in which the object was painted with luminous paint but no
      other cue was provided, and 3) full-cue, in which the movement was performed with
      the lights on and all the environmental information was available. Results
      revealed a striking effect of object distance on grip aperture equally in all
      three conditions. Specifically, grip aperture gradually decreased with increase
      in object distance, proving a consistent lack of depth constancy. These findings 
      clearly demonstrate that systematic biases in grasping actions are not induced by
      the use of virtual environments and that action and perception may involve the
      same visual information, which does not engage a metric reconstruction of the
      scene.

TI  - Cattle Uterus: A Novel Animal Laboratory Model for Advanced Hysteroscopic Surgery
      Training.
PG  - 967693
LID - 10.1155/2015/967693 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, due to reduced training opportunities, the major shift in
      surgical training is towards the use of simulation and animal laboratories.
      Despite the merits of Virtual Reality Simulators, they are far from representing 
      the real challenges encountered in theatres. We introduce the "Cattle Uterus
      Model" in the hope that it will be adopted in training courses as a low cost and 
      easy-to-set-up tool. It adds new dimensions to the advanced hysteroscopic surgery
      training experience by providing tactile sensation and simulating intraoperative 
      difficulties. It complements conventional surgical training, aiming to maximise
      clinical exposure and minimise patients' harm.

TI  - A Kinect-Based System for Lower Limb Rehabilitation in Parkinson's Disease
      Patients: a Pilot Study.
PG  - 103
LID - 10.1007/s10916-015-0289-0 [doi]
AB  - This work brings together the emerging virtual reality techniques and the natural
      user interfaces to offer new possibilities in the field of rehabilitation. We
      have designed a rehabilitation game based on a low cost device (Microsoft
      Kinect(TM)) connected to a personal computer. It provides patients having
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) with a motivating way to perform several motor
      rehabilitation exercises to improve their rehabilitation. The experiment was
      tested on seven Parkinson's Disease patients and results demonstrated significant
      improvements in completion time score and in the 10 Meters Walk Test score.
      Nevertheless, additional research is needed to determine if this type of training
      has a long-term impact. Both the device and protocol were well accepted by
      subjects, being safe and easy to use. We conclude that our work provides a simple
      and suitable tool resulting in a more enriching rehabilitation process where
      motivation is highly encouraged in PD patients. Feedback coming from participants
      corroborate the hypothesis that the system can be applied not only in clinical
      rehabilitation centers but at home.

TI  - Recognizing Clinical Styles in a Dental Surgery Simulator.
PG  - 163-7
AB  - Recognizing clinical style is essential for generating intelligent guidance in
      virtual reality simulators for dental skill acquisition. The aim of this study
      was to determine the potential of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in matching novices'
      tooth cutting sequences with those of experts. Forty dental students and four
      expert dentists were enrolled to perform access opening to the root canals with a
      simulator. Four experts performed in manners that differed widely in the tooth
      preparation sequence. Forty students were randomly allocated into four groups and
      were trained following each expert. DTW was performed between each student's
      sequence and all the expert sequences to determine the best match. Overall, the
      accuracy of the matching was high (95%). The current results suggest that the DTW
      is a useful technique to find the best matching expert for a student so that
      feedback based on that expert's performance can be given to the novice in
      clinical skill training.

TI  - Leap motion controlled videogame-based therapy for rehabilitation of elderly
      patients with subacute stroke: a feasibility pilot study.
PG  - 306-16
LID - 10.1179/1074935714Z.0000000036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The leap motion controller (LMC) is a new optoelectronic system for
      capturing motion of both hands and controlling a virtual environment. Differently
      from previous devices, it optoelectronically tracks the fine movements of fingers
      neither using glows nor markers. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study explored the
      feasibility of adapting the LMC, developed for videogames, to neurorehabilitation
      of elderly with subacute stroke. METHODS: Four elderly patients (71.50 +/- 4.51
      years old) affected by stroke in subacute phase were enrolled and tested in a
      cross-over pilot trial in which six sessions of 30 minutes of LMC videogame-based
      therapy were added on conventional therapy. Measurements involved participation
      to the sessions, evaluated by means of the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation
      Participation Scale, hand ability and grasp force evaluated respectively by means
      of the Abilhand Scale and by means of the dynamometer. RESULTS: Neither adverse
      effects nor spasticity increments were observed during LMC training.
      Participation to the sessions was excellent in three patients and very good in
      one patient during the LMC trial. In this period, patients showed a significantly
      higher improvement in hand abilities (P = 0.028) and grasp force (P = 0.006).
      CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility pilot study was the first one using leap motion
      controller for conducting a videogame-based therapy. This study provided a proof 
      of concept that LMC can be a suitable tool even for elderly patients with
      subacute stroke. LMC training was in fact performed with a high level of active
      participation, without adverse effects, and contributed to increase the recovery 
      of hand abilities.

TI  - Virtual rehabilitation via Nintendo Wii(R) and conventional physical therapy
      effectively treat post-stroke hemiparetic patients.
PG  - 299-305
LID - 10.1179/1074935714Z.0000000017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Nintendo(R) Wii is a simple and affordable virtual therapy
      alternative. It may be used at home, and it is a motivating recreational activity
      that provides continuous feedback. However, studies comparing the use of the
      Nintendo(R) Wii to conventional physical therapy are needed. OBJECTIVE: To
      compare the effect of a rehabilitation treatment using the Nintendo(R) Wii (NW)
      with conventional physical therapy (CPT) to improve the sensorimotor function and
      quality of life for post-stroke hemiparetic patients. METHODS: The present study 
      applied a randomized, blind, and controlled clinical trial. In total, 30 patients
      with post-stroke hemiparesis were evaluated. A total of 15 patients were randomly
      assigned to each group. The SF-36 quality of life and Fugl-Meyer scales were used
      to evaluate the patients. RESULTS: After treatment, the only variable that
      differed between the groups was the physical functioning domain of the SF-36 in
      the group that received conventional physical therapy. A significant difference
      was observed between both groups before and after treatment in terms of the
      following Fugl-Meyer scale items: passive movement and pain, motor function of
      the upper limbs (ULs), and balance. The CPT group also showed a significant
      difference with regard to their UL and lower limb (LL) coordination. The SF-36
      scale analysis revealed a significant difference within both groups with regard
      to the following domains: physical functioning, role limitation due to physical
      aspects, vitality, and role limitation due to emotional aspects. The NW group
      also exhibited a significant difference in the mental health domain. The results 
      indicate that both approaches improved the patients' performance in a similar
      manner. CONCLUSION: Virtual rehabilitation using the Nintendo Wii(R) and CPT both
      effectively treat post-stroke hemiparetic patients by improving passive movement 
      and pain scores, motor function of the upper limb, balance, physical functioning,
      vitality, and the physical and emotional aspects of role functioning.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spatial orientation and navigation depends on information from the
      vestibular system. Previous work suggested impaired spatial navigation in
      patients with bilateral vestibular failure (BVF). The aim of this study was to
      investigate event-related brain activity by functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) during spatial navigation and visual memory tasks in BVF patients.
      METHODS: Twenty-three BVF patients and healthy age- and gender matched control
      subjects performed learning sessions of spatial navigation by watching short
      films taking them through various streets from a driver's perspective along a
      route to the Cathedral of Cologne using virtual reality videos (adopted and
      modified from Google Earth). In the scanner, participants were asked to respond
      to questions testing for visual memory or spatial navigation while they viewed
      short video clips. From a similar but not identical perspective depicted video
      frames of routes were displayed which they had previously seen or which were
      completely novel to them. RESULTS: Compared with controls, posterior cerebellar
      activity in BVF patients was higher during spatial navigation than during visual 
      memory tasks, in the absence of performance differences. This cerebellar activity
      correlated with disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebellar activity during spatial
      navigation in BVF patients may reflect increased non-vestibular efforts to
      counteract the development of spatial navigation deficits in BVF. Conceivably,
      cerebellar activity indicates a change in navigational strategy of BVF patients, 
      i.e. from a more allocentric, landmark or place-based strategy (hippocampus) to a
      more sequence-based strategy. This interpretation would be in accord with recent 
      evidence for a cerebellar role in sequence-based navigation.

TI  - E-virtual reality exposure therapy in acrophobia: A pilot study.
LID - 1357633X15598243 [pii]
AB  - Virtual reality therapy is already used for anxiety disorders as an alternative
      to in vivo and in imagino exposure. To our knowledge, however, no one has yet
      proposed using remote virtual reality (e-virtual reality). The aim of the present
      study was to assess e-virtual reality in an acrophobic population. Six
      individuals with acrophobia each underwent six sessions (two sessions per week)
      of virtual reality exposure therapy. The first three were remote sessions, while 
      the last three were traditional sessions in the physical presence of the
      therapist. Anxiety (STAI form Y-A, visual analog scale, heart rate), presence,
      technical difficulties and therapeutic alliance (Working Alliance Inventory) were
      measured. In order to control the conditions in which these measures were made,
      all the sessions were conducted in hospital. None of the participants dropped
      out. The remote sessions were well accepted. None of the participants verbalized 
      reluctance. No major technical problems were reported. None of the sessions were 
      cancelled or interrupted because of software incidents. Measures (anxiety,
      presence, therapeutic alliance) were comparable across the two conditions.
      e-Virtual reality can therefore be used to treat acrophobic disorders. However,
      control studies are needed to assess online feasibility, therapeutic effects and 
      the mechanisms behind online presence.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics are increasingly used to
      supplement the teaching of anatomy. While most systems consist of a program which
      produces 3D renderings on a workstation with a standard screen, the Dextrobeam
      virtual reality VR environment allows the presentation of spatial neuroanatomical
      models to larger groups of students through a stereoscopic projection system.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Second-year medical students (n=169) were randomly
      allocated to receive a standardised pre-recorded audio lecture detailing the
      anatomy of the third ventricle accompanied by either a two-dimensional (2D)
      PowerPoint presentation (n=80) or a 3D animated tour of the third ventricle with 
      the DextroBeam. Students completed a 10-question multiple-choice exam based on
      the content learned and a subjective evaluation of the teaching method
      immediately after the lecture. RESULTS: Students in the 2D group achieved a mean 
      score of 5.19 (+/-2.12) compared to 5.45 (+/-2.16) in the 3D group, with the
      results in the 3D group statistically non-inferior to those of the 2D group
      (p<0.0001). The students rated the 3D method superior to 2D teaching in four
      domains (spatial understanding, application in future anatomy classes,
      effectiveness, enjoyableness) (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Stereoscopically enhanced 3D 
      lectures are valid methods of imparting neuroanatomical knowledge and are well
      received by students. More research is required to define and develop the role of
      large-group VR systems in modern neuroanatomy curricula.

AB  - Stroke remains one of the major causes of disability worldwide. This case report 
      illustrates the complementary use of biomechanical and kinematic in-game markers,
      in addition to standard clinical outcomes, to comprehensively assess and track a 
      patient's disabilities. A 65-year-old patient was admitted for right-sided
      weakness and clinically diagnosed with acute ischaemic stroke. She participated
      in a short trial of standard stroke occupational therapy and physiotherapy with
      additional daily virtual reality (VR)-based therapy. Outcomes were tracked using 
      kinematic data and conventional clinical assessments. Her Functional Independence
      Measure score improved from 87 to 113 and Fugl-Meyer motor score improved from 56
      to 62, denoting clinically significant improvement. Corresponding kinematic
      analysis revealed improved hand path ratios and a decrease in velocity peaks.
      Further research is being undertaken to elucidate the optimal type, timing,
      setting and duration of VR-based therapy, as well as the use of
      neuropharmacological adjuncts.

TI  - Is there a place for virtual reality simulators in assessment of competency in
      percutaneous renal access?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess competency of urology post-graduate trainees (PGTs) in
      percutaneous renal access (PCA). METHODS: Upon obtaining ethics approval and
      informed consents, PGTs between post-graduate years (PGY-3 to PGY-5) from all
      four urology programs in Quebec were recruited. PCA competency of each
      participant was assessed objectively by performing task 4 on the PERC Mentor
      simulator, where they had to correctly access and pop 7 balloons in 7 different
      renal calyces and subjectively by the validated Percutaneous
      Nephrolithotomy-Global Rating Scale (PCNL-GRS). RESULTS: A total of 26 PGTs with 
      a mean age of 29.2 +/- 0.7 years participated in this study. When compared with
      the 21 PGTs without practice, all 5 PGTs who had practiced on the simulator were 
      competent (p = 0.03), performed the task with significantly shorter operative
      time (13.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.4 min; p < 0.001) and fluoroscopy time (9.3 +/- 
      0.6 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.4 min; p < 0.001), and had significantly higher PCNL-GRS scores
      (13 +/- 0.6 vs. 20.6 +/- 1; p < 0.001) and successful attempts to access renal
      calyces (23 +/- 5 vs. 68.7 +/- 11; p = 0.001). According to a pass score of
      13/25, thirteen PGTs were competent. Competent PGTs performed the task with
      significantly shorter fluoroscopy time (9.8 vs. 6.5 min; p = 0.01) and higher
      percentage of successful attempts to access renal calyces (p < 0.001), higher
      PCNL-GRS scores (p < 0.001), and lower complications (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The 
      PCNL-GRS in combination with the PERC Mentor simulator was able to differentiate 
      between competent and non-competent PGTs.

TI  - Virtual restorative environment therapy as an adjunct to pain control during burn
      dressing changes: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 329
LID - 10.1186/s13063-015-0878-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pain of a severe burn injury is often characterised by intense
      background pain, coupled with severe exacerbations associated with essential
      procedures such as dressing changes. The experience of pain is affected by
      patients' psychological state and can be enhanced by the anxiety, fear and
      distress caused by environmental and visual inputs. Virtual Reality (VR)
      distraction has been used with success in areas such as burns, paediatrics and
      oncology. The underlying principle of VR is that attention is diverted from the
      painful stimulus by the use of engaging, dynamic 3D visual content and associated
      auditory stimuli. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies undertaken
      during VR distraction from experimental pain have demonstrated enhancement of the
      descending cortical pain-control system. METHODS/DESIGN: The present study will
      evaluate the feasibility of introducing a novel VR system to the Burns Unit at
      the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham for dressing changes: virtual restorative
      environment therapy (VRET). The study will also explore the system's impact on
      pain during and after the dressing changes compared to conventional analgesia for
      ward-based burn dressing changes. A within-subject crossover design will be used 
      to compare the following three conditions: 1. Interactive VRET plus conventional 
      analgesics. 2. Passive VRET with conventional analgesics. 3. Conventional
      analgesics alone. Using the Monte Carlo method, and on the basis of previous
      local audit data, a sample size of 25 will detect a clinically significant 33 %
      reduction in worst pain scores experienced during dressing changes. DISCUSSION:
      The study accrual rate is currently slower than predicted by previous audits of
      admission data. A review of the screening log has found that recruitment has been
      limited by the nature of burn care, the ability of burn inpatients to provide
      informed consent and the ability of patients to use the VR equipment. Prior to
      the introduction of novel interactive technologies for patient use, the
      characteristics and capabilities of the target population needs to be evaluated, 
      to ensure that the interface devices and simulations are usable. TRIAL

TI  - Notes From the Field: Secondary Task Precision for Cognitive Load Estimation
      During Virtual Reality Surgical Simulation Training.
LID - 0163278715597962 [pii]
AB  - Cognitive load (CL) theory suggests that working memory can be overloaded in
      complex learning tasks such as surgical technical skills training, which can
      impair learning. Valid and feasible methods for estimating the CL in specific
      learning contexts are necessary before the efficacy of CL-lowering instructional 
      interventions can be established. This study aims to explore secondary task
      precision for the estimation of CL in virtual reality (VR) surgical simulation
      and also investigate the effects of CL-modifying factors such as
      simulator-integrated tutoring and repeated practice. Twenty-four participants
      were randomized for visual assistance by a simulator-integrated tutor function
      during the first 5 of 12 repeated mastoidectomy procedures on a VR temporal bone 
      simulator. Secondary task precision was found to be significantly lower during
      simulation compared with nonsimulation baseline, p < .001. Contrary to
      expectations, simulator-integrated tutoring and repeated practice did not have an
      impact on secondary task precision. This finding suggests that even though
      considerable changes in CL are reflected in secondary task precision, it lacks
      sensitivity. In contrast, secondary task reaction time could be more sensitive,
      but requires substantial postprocessing of data. Therefore, future studies on the
      effect of CL modifying interventions should weigh the pros and cons of the
      various secondary task measurements.

AB  - It is often assumed that humans represent large-scale spatial environments as
      cognitive maps, but the exact features of these representations are still
      unclear. We investigate the structure of this representation with the impossible 
      worlds paradigm by testing whether the information provided by virtual
      environments (VEs) with arbitrary violations of geometrical rules is rectified
      ("distorted") to become compatible with a map-like structure. The experiments
      were conducted in virtual reality using a natural locomotion interface. The
      subjects' task was to explore possible and impossible VEs carefully to achieve a 
      "full understanding". After each trial, they had to "blindly" reproduce the path 
      through the environment from memory in a VE with impoverished visual cues. We
      have found no evidence for angular or configurational distortions or alterations 
      in the blind reproductions of impossible VEs. Blind reproduction indicates that
      impossible VEs do not require a transformation into a "possible" format to make
      them fit into the cognitive map. This suggests that the representation may not be
      similar to a map in a bounded sense of interpretation but requires more
      generalized concepts for its understanding.

TI  - Virtual Reality in Health System: Beyond Entertainment. A Mini-Review on the
      Efficacy of VR During Cancer Treatment.
PG  - 275-87
LID - 10.1002/jcp.25117 [doi]
AB  - Virtual reality (VR), a computer-generated virtual environment, has been
      increasingly used in the entertainment world becoming a very new evolving field, 
      but VR technology has also found a variety of applications in the biomedical
      field. VR can offer to subjects a safe environment within which to carry on
      different interventions ranging from the rehabilitation of discharged patients
      directly at home, to the support of hospitalized patients during different
      procedures and also of oncological inpatient subjects. VR appears as a promising 
      tool for support and monitoring treatments in cancer patients influencing
      psychological and physiological functions. The aim of this systematic review is
      to provide an overview of all the studies that used VR intervention on cancer
      patients and analyze their main findings. Nineteen studies across nearly a
      thousand articles were identified that explored effects of VR interventions on
      cancer patients. Although these studies varied greatly in setting and design,
      this review identified some overarching themes. Results found that VR improved
      patients' emotional well-being, and diminished cancer-related psychological
      symptoms. The studies explored various relevant variables including different
      types of settings (i.e., during chemotherapy, during pain procedures, during
      hospitalization). Here, we point to the need of a global and multi-disciplinary
      approach aimed at analyzing the effects of VR taking advantage of the new
      technology systems like biosensors as well as electroencephalogram monitoring
      pre, during, and after intervention. Devoting more attention to bio-physiological
      variables, standardized procedures, extending duration to longitudinal studies
      and adjusting for motion sickness related to VR treatment need to become standard
      of this research field. J. Cell. Physiol. 231: 275-287, 2016. (c) 2015 Wiley

TI  - Psychological Benefits of Nonpharmacological Methods Aimed for Improving Balance 
      in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 620674
LID - 10.1155/2015/620674 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious condition with a major negative impact on
      patient's physical and mental health. Postural instability is one of the cardinal
      difficulties reported by patients to deal with. Neuroanatomical, animal, and
      clinical studies on nonparkinsonian and parkinsonian subjects suggest an
      important correlation between the presence of balance dysfunction and multiple
      mood disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and apathy. Considering that balance
      dysfunction is a very common symptom in PD, we can presume that by its management
      we could positively influence patient's state of mind too. This review is an
      analysis of nonpharmacological methods shown to be effective and successful for
      improving balance in patients suffering from PD. Strategies such as general
      exercise, robotic assisted training, Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Yoga, dance (such as tango
      or ballet), box, virtual reality-based, or neurofeedback-based techniques and so 
      forth can significantly improve the stability in these patients. Beside this
      physical outcome, many methods have also shown effect on quality of life,
      depression level, enjoyment, and motivation to continue in practicing the method 
      independently. The purpose of this review is to provide information about
      practical and creative methods designed to improve balance in PD and highlight
      their positive impact on patient's psychology.

TI  - Computer-assisted surgical planning and intraoperative guidance in fetal surgery:
      a systematic review.
LID - 10.1002/pd.4660 [doi]
AB  - Fetal surgery has become a clinical reality, with interventions for twin-to-twin 
      transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and spina bifida demonstrated to improve outcome.
      Fetal imaging is evolving, with the use of 3D ultrasound and fetal MRI becoming
      more common in clinical practise. Medical imaging analysis is also changing, with
      technology being developed to assist surgeons by creating 3D virtual models that 
      improve understanding of complex anatomy, and prove powerful tools in surgical
      planning and intraoperative guidance. We introduce the concept of
      computer-assisted surgical planning, and present the results of a systematic
      review of image reconstruction for fetal surgical planning that identified six
      articles using such technology. Indications from other specialities suggest a
      benefit of surgical planning and guidance to improve outcomes. There is therefore
      an urgent need to develop fetal-specific technology in order to improve fetal
      surgical outcome. (c) 2015 The Authors. Prenatal Diagnosis published by John

TI  - Outcome Measures in Tele-Rehabilitation and Virtual Reality for Stroke Survivors:
      Protocol for a Scoping Review.
PG  - 46267
LID - 10.5539/gjhs.v8n1p79 [doi]
AB  - Despite the increased interest about tele-rehabilitation, virtual reality and
      outcome measures for stroke rehabilitation, surprisingly little research has been
      done to map and summarize the most common outcome measures used in
      tele-rehabilitation. For this review, we propose to conduct a systematic search
      of the literature that reports outcome measures used in tele-rehabilitation or
      virtual reality for stroke rehabilitation. Specific objectives include: 1) to
      identify the outcome measures used in tele-rehabilitation studies; 2) to describe
      the psychometric properties of the outcome measures in the included studies; 3)
      to describe which parts of the International Classification of Functioning are
      measured in the studies. METHODS: we will conduct a comprehensive search of
      relevant electronic databases (e.g., PUBMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, PSYCOINFO, Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trial and PEDRO). The scoping review will include 
      all study designs. Two reviewers will pilot-test the data extraction forms and
      will independently screen all the studies and extract the data. Disagreements
      about inclusion or exclusion will be resolved by consensus or by consulting a
      third reviewer. The results will be synthesized and reported considering the
      implications of the findings within the clinical practice and policy context.
      Dissemination: we anticipate that this scoping review will contribute to inform
      researchers and end-users (ie, clinicians and policy-makers), regarding the most 
      appropriate outcome measures for tele-rehabilitation or virtual reality as well
      as help to identify gaps in current measures. Results will be disseminated
      through reports and open access journals, conference presentations, as well as
      newsletters, podcasts and meetings targeting all the relevant stakeholders.

TI  - Investigating virtual reality navigation in amnestic mild cognitive impairment
      using fMRI.
PG  - 1-22
AB  - Spatial navigation requires a well-established network of brain regions,
      including the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex. Amnestic
      Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) is a condition with predominantly memory
      impairment, conferring a high predictive risk factor for dementia. aMCI is
      associated with hippocampal atrophy and subtle deficits in spatial navigation. We
      present the first use of a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
      navigation task in aMCI, using a virtual reality analog of the Radial Arm Maze.
      Compared with controls, aMCI patients showed reduced activity in the hippocampus 
      bilaterally, retrosplenial cortex, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
      Reduced activation in key areas for successful navigation, as well as additional 
      regions, was found alongside relatively normal task performance. Results also
      revealed increased activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in aMCI
      patients, which may reflect compensation for reduced activations elsewhere. These
      data support suggestions that fMRI spatial navigation tasks may be useful for
      staging of progression in MCI.

AB  - Gait variability measures have been linked to fall risk in older adults. However,
      challenging walking tasks may be required to elucidate increases in variability
      that arise from subtle age-related changes in cognitive processing and
      sensorimotor function. Hence, the study objective was to investigate the effects 
      of visual perturbations, increased cognitive load, and narrowed step width on
      gait variability in healthy old and young adults. Eleven old (OA, 71.2+/-4.2
      years) and twelve young (YA, 23.6+/-3.9 years) adults walked on a treadmill while
      watching a speed-matched virtual hallway. Subjects walked: (1) normally, (2) with
      mediolateral visual perturbations, (3) while performing a cognitive task (serial 
      seven subtractions), and (4) with narrowed step width. We computed the mean and
      variability of step width (SW and SWV, respectively) and length (SL, SLV) over
      one 3-min trial per condition. Walking normally, old and young adults exhibited
      similar SWV and SLV. Visual perturbations significantly increased gait
      variability in old adults (by more than 100% for both SWV and SLV), but not young
      adults. The cognitive task and walking with narrowed step width did not show any 
      effect on SWV or SLV in either group. The dramatic increase in step width
      variability when old adults were subjected to mediolateral visual perturbations
      was likely due to increased reliance on visual feedback for assessing whole-body 
      position. Further work is needed to ascertain whether these findings may reflect 
      sub-clinical balance deficits that could contribute to the increased fall risk
      seen with advancing age.

      space: a correlational study.

AB  - Although the effects of several personality factors on interpersonal space (i.e. 
      social space within personal comfort area) are well documented, it is not clear
      whether they also extend to peripersonal space (i.e. reaching space). Indeed, no 
      study has directly compared these spaces in relation to personality and anxiety
      factors even though such a comparison would help to clarify to what extent they
      share similar mechanisms and characteristics. The aim of the present paper was to
      investigate whether personality dimensions and anxiety levels are associated with
      reaching and comfort distances. Seventy university students (35 females) were
      administered the Big Five Questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory;
      afterwards, they had to provide reachability- and comfort-distance judgments
      towards human confederates while standing still (passive) or walking towards them
      (active). The correlation analyses showed that both spaces were positively
      related to anxiety and negatively correlated with the Dynamism in the active
      condition. Moreover, in the passive condition higher Emotional Stability was
      related to shorter comfort distance, while higher cognitive Openness was
      associated with shorter reachability distance. The implications of these results 
      are discussed.

AB  - After successful extinction of conditioned fear, the presentation of an
      unsignaled unconditioned stimulus (US) leads to return of fear, thus, the
      previously extinguished conditioned stimulus (CS) triggers fear responses again. 
      Human studies on such reinstatement processes are still inconclusive. Some
      revealed a general increase of fear reactions, both to the fear (CS+) and the
      safety stimulus (CS-), whereas other studies discovered a differential return of 
      fear with enhanced fear responses to the CS+ only. Moreover, we know little about
      reinstatement of contextual anxiety, a state of general anxious apprehension and 
      chronic worry. Therefore, the present study investigated reinstatement of
      contextual anxiety with an ecological valid virtual reality (VR) design.
      Additionally, we examined whether the current state anxiety might modulate the
      reinstatement of contextual anxiety. To this end, two groups underwent context
      conditioning on Day 1, i.e., one context (CXT+) became paired with unpredictable 
      USs, but not the other context (CXT-), and an extinction training on Day 2. On
      Day 3 a reinstatement test was conducted, i.e., one group (reinstatement group,
      n=21) received one unsignaled US before testing, whereas the control group (n=21)
      did not. Only the reinstatement group showed a differential return of contextual 
      anxiety as measured by fear-potentiated startle and anxiety ratings.
      Interestingly, the reinstatement of fear-potentiated startle was additionally
      influenced by state anxiety. Conclusively, an anxious state before an unsignaled 
      aversive event might favor a return of contextual anxiety.

AB  - Motek Medical's Computer Aided Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN)-Extended system
      is a virtual environment primarily used in physical rehabilitation and
      biomechanical research. This virtual environment consists of a 180 degree
      projection screen used to display a virtual scene, a 12-camera motion capture
      system, and a six degree of freedom actuated platform equipped with a dual-belt
      treadmill and two force plates. The goal of this article was to investigate the
      performance characteristics associated with a "treadmill-motion platform"
      configuration and how system operation can affect the data collected. Platform
      static and dynamic characteristics were evaluated by translating or rotating the 
      platform over progressively larger distances and comparing input and measured
      values. Treadmill belt speed was assessed with and without a person walking on
      the platform and at different orientations. Force plate measurements were
      examined when the treadmill was in operation, during ambulation, and over time to
      observe the baseline drift. Platform acceleration was dependent on the distance
      travelled and system settings. Treadmill speed variability was greatest at faster
      speeds. Force plate measurements were affected by platform and treadmill
      operation, contralateral impact forces during gait, and baseline drift. Knowledge
      of performance characteristics and their effect on outcome data is crucial for
      effective design of CAREN research protocols and rehabilitation scenarios.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A novel realistic 3D virtual reality (VR) application has been
      developed to allow medical imaging students at Queensland University of
      Technology to practice radiographic techniques independently outside the usual
      radiography laboratory. METHODS: A flexible agile development methodology was
      used to create the software rapidly and effectively. A 3D gaming environment and 
      realistic models were used to engender presence in the software while
      tutor-determined gold standards enabled students to compare their performance and
      learn in a problem-based learning pedagogy. RESULTS: Students reported high
      levels of satisfaction and perceived value and the software enabled up to 40
      concurrent users to prepare for clinical practice. Student feedback also
      indicated that they found 3D to be of limited value in the desktop version
      compared to the usual 2D approach. A randomised comparison between groups
      receiving software-based and traditional practice measured performance in a
      formative role play with real equipment. The results of this work indicated
      superior performance with the equipment for the VR trained students (P = 0.0366) 
      and confirmed the value of VR for enhancing 3D equipment-based problem-solving
      skills. CONCLUSIONS: Students practising projection techniques virtually
      performed better at role play assessments than students practising in a
      traditional radiography laboratory only. The application particularly helped with
      3D equipment configuration, suggesting that teaching 3D problem solving is an
      ideal use of such medical equipment simulators. Ongoing development work aims to 
      establish the role of VR software in preparing students for clinical practice
      with a range of medical imaging equipment.

TI  - Virtual Reality Training with Cognitive Load Improves Walking Function in Chronic
      Stroke Patients.

LID - 10.1620/tjem.236.273 [doi]
AB  - Virtual reality training is considered as an effective intervention method of
      stroke patients, and the virtual reality system for therapeutic rehabilitation
      has emphasized the cognitive factors to improve walking function. The purpose of 
      current study was to investigate the effect of virtual reality training with
      cognitive load (VRTCL) on walking function of chronic stroke. Chronic stroke
      patients were randomly assigned to the VRTCL group (11 patients, including 5 men;
      mean age, 60.0 years; post-stroke duration, 273.9 days) or control group (11
      patients, including 2 men; mean age, 58.6 years; post-stroke duration, 263.9
      days). All subjects participated in the standard rehabilitation program that
      consisted of physical and occupational therapies. In addition, VRTCL group
      participated in the VRTCL for 4 weeks (30 min per day and five times a week),
      while those in the control group participated in virtual reality treadmill
      training. Walking function under single (walking alone) and dual task (walking
      with cognitive tasks) conditions was assessed using an electrical walkway system.
      After the 4-week intervention, under both single and dual task conditions,
      significant improvement on walking function was observed in VRTCL and control
      groups (P < 0.05). In addition, in the dual task condition, greater improvement
      on walking function was observed in the VRTCL group, compared with the control
      group (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrated the efficacy of VRTCL on the
      walking function under the dual task condition. Therefore, we suggest that VRTCL 
      may be an effective method for the achievement of independent walking in chronic 
      stroke patients.

TI  - Control of a Supernumerary Robotic Hand by Foot: An Experimental Study in Virtual
      Reality.
PG  - e0134501
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0134501 [doi]
AB  - In the operational theater, the surgical team could highly benefit from a robotic
      supplementary hand under the surgeon's full control. The surgeon may so become
      more autonomous; this may reduce communication errors with the assistants and
      take over difficult tasks such as holding tools without tremor. In this paper, we
      therefore examine the possibility to control a third robotic hand with one foot's
      movements. Three experiments in virtual reality were designed to assess the
      feasibility of this control strategy, the learning curve of the subjects in
      different tasks and the coordination of foot movements with the two natural
      hands. Results show that the limbs are moved simultaneously, in parallel rather
      than serially. Participants' performance improved within a few minutes of
      practice without any specific difficulty to complete the tasks. Subjective
      assessment by the subjects indicated that controlling a third hand by foot has
      been easy and required only negligible physical and mental efforts. The sense of 
      ownership was reported to improve through the experiments. The mental burden was 
      not directly related to the level of motion required by a task, but depended on
      the type of activity and practice. The most difficult task was moving two hands
      and foot in opposite directions. These results suggest that a combination of
      practice and appropriate tasks can enhance the learning process for controlling a
      robotic hand by foot.

TI  - Neurophysiological correlates of embodiment and motivational factors during the
      perception of virtual architectural environments.
PG  - 425-9
LID - 10.1007/s10339-015-0725-6 [doi]
AB  - The recent efforts aimed at providing neuroscientific explanations of how people 
      perceive and experience architectural environments have largely justified the
      initial belief in the value of neuroscience for architecture. However, a
      systematic development of a coherent theoretical and experimental framework is
      missing. To investigate the neurophysiological reactions related to the
      appreciation of ambiances, we recorded the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals 
      in an immersive virtual reality during the appreciation of interior designs. Such
      data have been analyzed according to the working hypothesis that appreciated
      environments involve embodied simulation mechanisms and circuits mediating
      approaching stimuli. EEG recordings of 12 healthy subjects have been performed
      during the perception of three-dimensional interiors that have been simulated in 
      a CAVE system and judged according to dimensions of familiarity, novelty,
      comfort, pleasantness, arousal and presence. A correlation analysis on personal
      judgments returned that scores of novelty, pleasantness and comfort are
      positively correlated, while familiarity and novelty are in negative way.
      Statistical spectral maps reveal that pleasant, novel and comfortable interiors
      produce a de-synchronization of the mu rhythm over left sensorimotor areas.
      Interiors judged more pleasant and less familiar generate an activation of left
      frontal areas (theta and alpha bands), along an involvement of areas devoted to
      spatial navigation. An increase in comfort returns an enhancement of the theta
      frontal midline activity. Cerebral activations underlying appreciation of
      architecture could involve different mechanisms regulating corporeal, emotional
      and cognitive reactions. Therefore, it might be suggested that people's
      experience of architectural environments is intrinsically structured by the
      possibilities for action.

TI  - Designing a Standardized Laparoscopy Curriculum for Gynecology Residents: A
      Delphi Approach.
PG  - 197-202
LID - 10.4300/JGME-D-14-00548.1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that simulation leads to improved operative skill, 
      shorter operating room time, and better patient outcomes. Currently, no
      standardized laparoscopy curriculum exists for gynecology residents. OBJECTIVE:
      To design a structured laparoscopy curriculum for gynecology residents using
      Delphi consensus methodology. METHODS: This study began with Delphi methodology
      to determine expert consensus on the components of a gynecology laparoscopic
      skills curriculum. We generated a list of cognitive content, technical skills,
      and nontechnical skills for training in laparoscopic surgery, and asked 39
      experts in gynecologic education to rate the items on a Likert scale (1-5) for
      inclusion in the curriculum. Consensus was predefined as Cronbach alpha of
      >/=0.80. We then conducted another Delphi survey with 9 experienced users of
      laparoscopic virtual reality simulators to delineate relevant curricular tasks.
      Finally, a cross-sectional design defined benchmark scores for all identified
      tasks, with 10 experienced gynecologic surgeons performing the identified tasks
      at basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. RESULTS: Consensus (Cronbach
      alpha=0.85) was achieved in the first round of the curriculum Delphi, and after 2
      rounds (Cronbach alpha=0.80) in the virtual reality curriculum Delphi. Consensus 
      was reached for cognitive, technical, and nontechnical skills as well as for 6
      virtual reality tasks. Median time and economy of movement scores defined
      benchmarks for all tasks. CONCLUSIONS: This study used Delphi consensus to
      develop a comprehensive curriculum for teaching gynecologic laparoscopy. The
      curriculum conforms to current educational standards of proficiency-based
      training, and is suggested as a standard in residency programs.

AB  - The maintenance of anxiety disorders is thought to depend, in part, on deficits
      in extinction memory, possibly due to reduced contextual control of extinction
      that leads to fear renewal. Animal studies suggest that the neural circuitry
      responsible fear renewal includes the hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsomedial
      (dmPFC) and ventromedial (vmPFC) prefrontal cortex. However, the neural
      mechanisms of context-dependent fear renewal in humans remain poorly understood. 
      We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), combined with
      psychophysiology and immersive virtual reality, to elucidate how the hippocampus,
      amygdala, and dmPFC and vmPFC interact to drive the context-dependent renewal of 
      extinguished fear. Healthy human participants encountered dynamic fear-relevant
      conditioned stimuli (CSs) while navigating through 3-D virtual reality
      environments in the MRI scanner. Conditioning and extinction were performed in
      two different virtual contexts. Twenty-four hours later, participants were
      exposed to the CSs without reinforcement while navigating through both contexts
      in the MRI scanner. Participants showed enhanced skin conductance responses
      (SCRs) to the previously-reinforced CS+ in the acquisition context on Day 2,
      consistent with fear renewal, and sustained responses in the dmPFC. In contrast, 
      participants showed low SCRs to the CSs in the extinction context on Day 2,
      consistent with extinction recall, and enhanced vmPFC activation to the
      non-reinforced CS-. Structural equation modeling revealed that the dmPFC fully
      mediated the effect of the hippocampus on right amygdala activity during fear
      renewal, whereas the vmPFC partially mediated the effect of the hippocampus on
      right amygdala activity during extinction recall. These results indicate
      dissociable contextual influences of the hippocampus on prefrontal pathways,
      which, in turn, determine the level of reactivation of fear associations.

TI  - Integrative rehabilitation of residents chronic post-stroke in skilled nursing
      facilities: the design and evaluation of the BrightArm Duo.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the novel BrightArm Duo bimanual upper extremity (UE)
      rehabilitation system; to determine its technology acceptance and clinical
      benefit for older hemiplegic participants. METHODS: The system table tilted to
      adjust arm gravity loading. Participants wore arm supports that sensed grasp
      strength and wrist position on the table. Wrist weights further increased
      shoulder exertion. Games were designed to improve UE strength, motor function,
      cognition and emotive state and adapted automatically to each participant. The
      system underwent feasibility trials spanning 8 weeks in two skilled nursing
      facilities (SNFs). Participants were evaluated pre-therapy and post-therapy using
      standardized clinical measures. Computerized measures of supported arm reach,
      table tilt and number of arm repetitions were stored on a remote server.
      OUTCOMES: Seven participants had significant improvements in their active range
      of shoulder movement, supported arm reach, shoulder strength, grasp strength and 
      their ability to focus. The group demonstrated higher arm function measured with 
      FMA (p = 0.01) and CAHAI (p = 0.05), and had an improvement in depression (Becks 
      Depression Inventory, II). BrightArm Duo technology was well accepted by
      participants with a rating of 4.4 out of 5 points. CONCLUSIONS: Given these
      findings, it will be beneficial to evaluate the BrightArm Duo application in SNF 
      maintenance programs. Implications for Rehabilitation Integrative rehabilitation 
      that addresses both physical and cognitive domains is promising for post-stroke
      maintenance in skilled nursing facilities. Simultaneous bilateral arm exercise
      may improve arm function in older hemiplegic patients several years after stroke.
      Virtual reality games that adapt to the patient can increase attention and
      working memory while decreasing depression in elderly.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To validate the Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer
      (VBLaST-PT; the peg transfer task) for concurrent validity based on its ability
      to differentiate between novice, intermediate, and expert groups of
      gynecologists, and the gynecologists' subjective preference between the physical 
      Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) system and the virtual reality system.
      DESIGN: Prospective study (Canadian Task Force II-2). SETTING: Academic medical
      center. PARTICIPANTS: Obstetrics and gynecology residents (n = 18) and attending 
      gynecologists (n = 9). INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-seven subjects were divided into 3
      groups: novices (n = 9), intermediates (n = 9), and experts (n = 9). All subjects
      performed 10 trials of the peg transfer on each simulator. Assessment of
      laparoscopic performance was based on FLS scoring, whereas a questionnaire was
      used for subjective evaluation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The performance
      scores in the 2 simulators were nearly identical. Experts performed better than
      intermediates and novices in both the FLS trainer and the VBLAST, and
      intermediates performed better than novices in both simulators. The results also 
      show a significant learning effect on both trainers for all subgroups; however,
      the greatest learning effect was in the novice group for both trainers.
      Subjectively, 74% participants preferred the FLS over the VBLaST for training
      laparoscopic surgical skills. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the peg
      transfer task was reproduced well in the VBLaST in gynecologic surgeons and
      trainees. The VBLaST has the potential to be a valuable tool in laparoscopic
      training for gynecologic surgeons.

TI  - Laparoscopic skill improvement after virtual reality simulator training in
      medical students as assessed by augmented reality simulator.
LID - 10.1111/ases.12209 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Definitive assessment of laparoscopic skill improvement after
      virtual reality simulator training is best obtained during an actual operation.
      However, this is impossible in medical students. Therefore, we developed an
      alternative assessment technique using an augmented reality simulator. METHODS:
      Nineteen medical students completed a 6-week training program using a virtual
      reality simulator (LapSim). The pretest and post-test were performed using an
      object-positioning module and cholecystectomy on an augmented reality
      simulator(ProMIS). The mean performance measures between pre- and post-training
      on the LapSim were compared with a paired t-test. RESULTS: In the
      object-positioning module, the execution time of the task (P < 0.001), left and
      right instrument path length (P = 0.001), and left and right instrument economy
      of movement (P < 0.001) were significantly shorter after than before the LapSim
      training. With respect to improvement in laparoscopic cholecystectomy using a
      gallbladder model, the execution time to identify, clip, and cut the cystic duct 
      and cystic artery as well as the execution time to dissect the gallbladder away
      from the liver bed were both significantly shorter after than before the LapSim
      training (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our training curriculum using a virtual reality
      simulator improved the operative skills of medical students as objectively
      evaluated by assessment using an augmented reality simulator instead of an actual
      operation. We hope that these findings help to establish an effective training
      program for medical students.

AB  - Self-face recognition, a hallmark of self-awareness, depends on 'off-line' stored
      information about one's face and 'on-line' multisensory-motor face-related cues. 
      The brain mechanisms of how on-line sensory-motor processes affect off-line
      neural self-face representations are unknown. This study used 3D virtual reality 
      to create a 'virtual mirror' in which participants saw an avatar's face moving
      synchronously with their own face movements. Electroencephalographic (EEG)
      analysis during virtual mirror exposure revealed mu oscillations in sensory-motor
      cortex signalling on-line congruency between the avatar's and participants'
      movements. After such exposure and compatible with a change in their off-line
      self-face representation, participants were more prone to recognize the avatar's 
      face as their own, and this was also reflected in the activation of face-specific
      regions in the inferotemporal cortex. Further EEG analysis showed that the
      on-line sensory-motor effects during virtual mirror exposure caused these
      off-line visual effects, revealing the brain mechanisms that maintain a coherent 
      self-representation, despite our continuously changing appearance.

AB  - This review investigates the available literature that addresses the impact
      simulator training has on patient outcomes. The authors conducted a comprehensive
      literature search of studies reporting outcomes of simulation training and
      categorized studies based on the Kirkpatrick model of training evaluation.
      Kirkpatrick level 4 studies reporting patient outcomes were identified and
      included in this review. Existing evidence is promising, demonstrating patient
      benefits as a result of simulation training for central line placement, obstetric
      emergencies, cataract surgery, laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, and team
      training.

AB  - The use of simulation in Graduate Medical Education has evolved significantly
      over time, particularly during the past decade. The applications of simulation
      include introductory and basic technical skills, more advanced technical skills, 
      and nontechnical skills, and simulation is gaining acceptance in high-stakes
      assessments. Simulation-based training has also brought about paradigm shifts in 
      the medical and surgical education arenas and has borne new and exciting national
      and local consortia that will ensure that the scope and impact of simulation will
      continue to broaden.

      psychosocial stress.

AB  - Prior findings indicate that individuals scoring high on vital exhaustion show a 
      dysfunctional stress response (DSR), that is, reduced cortisol reactivity and
      habituation to psychosocial stressors. The main aim of the present study was to
      examine whether a DSR may be a vulnerability factor in exhaustion disorder (ED). 
      We examined whether a DSR is present during the early stages of ED, and still is 
      present after recovery. Three groups were studied: 1. Former ED patients (n=14); 
      2. persons who during the past 6month had experienced stress at work and had a
      Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ) score over 3.75, considered to
      indicate a pre-stage of ED (n=17); 3. persons who had not experienced stress at
      work during the past 6months and had a SMBQ score below 2.75 (n=20). The
      participants were exposed twice to a virtual version of the Trier Social Stress
      Test (V-TSST), during which salivary cortisol samples were collected. In
      addition, high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), heart rate (HR), t-wave
      amplitude (TWA), and alpha-amylase were assessed to examine stress reactivity and
      habituation in the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The initial analyses showed
      clear hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system
      (SNS) activations in both V-TSST sessions, together with habituation of cortisol 
      and heart rate in the second session, but without any significant group
      differences. However, the former ED patients showed considerable variation in
      self-reported signs of exhaustion (SMBQ). This led us to assign former ED
      patients with lower ratings into the low SMBQ group (LOWS) and those with higher 
      ratings to the high SMBQ group (HIGHS). When repeating the analyses a different
      picture emerged; the HIGHS showed a lower cortisol response to the V-TSST than
      did the LOWS. Both groups' cortisol response habituated to the second V-TSST
      session. The ANS responses did not differ between the two groups. Thus, persons
      in a pre-stage of ED and unrecovered former ED patients showed signs of DSR, in
      contrast to healthy controls and recovered former ED patients. The results may be
      interpreted as indicating that DSR in the HPA axis is present early on in the
      stress process, but subsides after successful recovery.

AB  - Valgus foot (VF) is the most common foot deformity in children with cerebral
      palsy (CP), which seriously affects the foot balance in standing and posture
      control in walking. Little information about the locus and stress of internal
      bones was available. To accurately describe the biomechanical behavior of the
      internal bones of VF in CP, we compared the locus and stress of internal bones
      between the normal foot (NF) and VF by finite element models. Compared with the
      NF, displacement of the talus and navicular drop in VF increased by 109% and 171%
      in vertical direction respectively, and the locus of talus had a tendency to
      clockwise rotation and downward movement in coronal plane. In addition, the
      abduction angle of forefoot in VF increased up to 10.3 degrees , which was twice 
      more than that in the NF. Moreover, the lateral metatarsophalangeal joints were
      upward tilted 6.3 degrees comparing with touchdown posture of NF, and peak von
      Mises stress of the internal bones in VF model concentrated on the fourth
      metatarsal. The simulation showed that locus of the forefoot, downward rotation
      of talus head and navicular drop were meaningful to quantify the collapse of
      medial longitudinal arch. It would provide some suggestions to the rehabilitation
      treatments of the CP children's VF.

AB  - Corneal wound healing is a complex process involving cell death, migration,
      proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Many
      similarities are observed in the healing processes of corneal epithelial, stromal
      and endothelial cells, as well as cell-specific differences. Corneal epithelial
      healing largely depends on limbal stem cells and remodeling of the basement
      membrane. During stromal healing, keratocytes get transformed to motile and
      contractile myofibroblasts largely due to activation of transforming growth
      factor-beta (TGF-beta) system. Endothelial cells heal mostly by migration and
      spreading, with cell proliferation playing a secondary role. In the last decade, 
      many aspects of wound healing process in different parts of the cornea have been 
      elucidated, and some new therapeutic approaches have emerged. The concept of
      limbal stem cells received rigorous experimental corroboration, with new markers 
      uncovered and new treatment options including gene and microRNA therapy tested in
      experimental systems. Transplantation of limbal stem cell-enriched cultures for
      efficient re-epithelialization in stem cell deficiency and corneal injuries has
      become reality in clinical setting. Mediators and course of events during stromal
      healing have been detailed, and new treatment regimens including gene (decorin)
      and stem cell therapy for excessive healing have been designed. This is a very
      important advance given the popularity of various refractive surgeries entailing 
      stromal wound healing. Successful surgical ways of replacing the diseased
      endothelium have been clinically tested, and new approaches to accelerate
      endothelial healing and suppress endothelial-mesenchymal transformation have been
      proposed including Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor eye drops and gene therapy to
      activate TGF-beta inhibitor SMAD7. Promising new technologies with potential for 
      corneal wound healing manipulation including microRNA, induced pluripotent stem
      cells to generate corneal epithelium, and nanocarriers for corneal drug delivery 
      are discussed. Attention is also paid to problems in wound healing understanding 
      and treatment, such as lack of specific epithelial stem cell markers, reliable
      identification of stem cells, efficient prevention of haze and stromal scar
      formation, lack of data on wound regulating microRNAs in keratocytes and
      endothelial cells, as well as virtual lack of targeted systems for drug and gene 
      delivery to select corneal cells.

TI  - Gaming and Conventional Exercises for Improvement of Arm Function After Stroke: A
      Randomized Controlled Pilot Study.
PG  - 184-91
LID - 10.1089/g4h.2014.0026 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The use of new technologies in rehabilitation, such as virtual reality
      and/or computerized gaming exercises, may be useful to enable patients to
      practice intensively in a motivating way. The objective of the present randomized
      controlled pilot study was to compare the effect of reach training using a target
      group specific-designed rehabilitation game to time-matched standardized
      conventional reach training on arm function after stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Twenty chronic stroke patients were randomized to either the rehabilitation game 
      group or the conventional training group. Both groups received three arm training
      sessions of 30 minutes each week, during a period of 6 weeks. Arm (the upper
      extremity part of Fugl-Meyer [FM] assessment) and hand (the Action Research Arm
      [ARA] test) functions were tested 1 week before (T0) and 1 week after (T1)
      training. A follow-up measurement was performed at 1 month after T1 (T2).
      RESULTS: ARA and FM scores improved significantly within both groups. Post hoc
      comparisons revealed significant increases in test scores between T0 and T1 and
      between T0 and T2 for both ARA and FM, but not for changes from T1 to T2. There
      were no significant differences between both groups for either clinical test.
      CONCLUSIONS: The present randomized controlled pilot study showed that both arm
      and hand function improved as much after training with a rehabilitation game as
      after time-matched conventional training.

TI  - Design and Evaluation of Virtual Reality-Based Therapy Games with Dual Focus on
      Therapeutic Relevance and User Experience for Children with Cerebral Palsy.
PG  - 162-71
LID - 10.1089/g4h.2014.0003 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Virtual reality (VR)-based therapy for motor rehabilitation of
      children with cerebral palsy (CP) is growing in prevalence. Although mainstream
      active videogames typically offer children an appealing user experience, they are
      not designed for therapeutic relevance. Conversely, rehabilitation-specific games
      often struggle to provide an immersive experience that sustains interest. This
      study aims to design and evaluate two VR-based therapy games for upper and lower 
      limb rehabilitation and to evaluate their efficacy with dual focus on therapeutic
      relevance and user experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three occupational
      therapists, three physiotherapists, and eight children (8-12 years old), with CP 
      Level I-III on the Gross Motor Function Classification System, evaluated two
      games for the Microsoft((R)) (Redmond, WA) Kinect for Windows and completed the
      System Usability Scale (SUS), Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES), and
      custom feedback questionnaires. RESULTS: Children and therapists unanimously
      agreed on the enjoyment and therapeutic value of the games. Median scores on the 
      PACES were high (6.24+/-0.95 on the 7-point scale). Therapists considered the
      system to be of average usability (50th percentile on the SUS). The most
      prevalent usability issue was detection errors distinguishing the child's
      movements from the supporting therapist's. The ability to adjust difficulty
      settings and to focus on targeted goals (e.g., elbow/shoulder extension, weight
      shifting) was highly valued by therapists. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging both therapists 
      and children in a user-centered design approach enabled the development of two
      VR-based therapy games for upper and lower limb rehabilitation that are dually
      (a) engaging to the child and (b) therapeutically relevant.

TI  - Using Virtual Reality and Videogames for Traumatic Brain Injury Rehabilitation: A
      Structured Literature Review.
PG  - 202-14
LID - 10.1089/g4h.2014.0013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the available literature about the use of novel
      methods of rehabilitation using virtual reality interventions for people living
      with posttraumatic brain injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE,
      SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library databases were searched using the terms "virtual
      reality" OR "video games" AND "traumatic brain injury." Included studies
      investigated therapeutic use of virtual reality in adults with a brain trauma
      resulting from acquired closed head injury, reported outcomes that included
      measures of motor or cognitive functionality, and were published in a
      peer-reviewed journal written in English. RESULTS: Eighteen articles fulfilled
      inclusion criteria. Eight were case studies, five studies had a
      quasi-experimental design with a pre-post comparison, and five were pilot
      randomized control trials or comparative studies. The virtual reality systems
      used were commercial or custom designed for the study and ranged from expensive, 
      fully immersive systems to cheap online games or videogames. In before-after
      comparisons, improvements in balance were seen in four case studies and two small
      randomized control trials. Between-group comparisons in these randomized control 
      trials showed no difference between virtual reality and traditional therapy.
      Post-training improvements were also seen for upper extremity functions (five
      small studies) and for various cognitive function measures (four case studies and
      one pilot randomized control trial). Attitudes of participants toward virtual
      reality interventions was more positive than for traditional therapy (three
      studies). CONCLUSIONS: The evidence that the use of virtual reality in
      rehabilitation of traumatic brain injury improves motor and cognitive
      functionality is currently very limited. However, this approach has the potential
      to provide alternative, possibly more affordable and available rehabilitation
      therapy for traumatic brain injury in settings where access to therapy is limited
      by geographical or financial constraints.

TI  - Modeling strategic use of human computer interfaces with novel hidden Markov

AB  - Immersive software tools are virtual environments designed to give their users an
      augmented view of real-world data and ways of manipulating that data. As virtual 
      environments, every action users make while interacting with these tools can be
      carefully logged, as can the state of the software and the information it
      presents to the user, giving these actions context. This data provides a
      high-resolution lens through which dynamic cognitive and behavioral processes can
      be viewed. In this report, we describe new methods for the analysis and
      interpretation of such data, utilizing a novel implementation of the Beta Process
      Hidden Markov Model (BP-HMM) for analysis of software activity logs. We further
      report the results of a preliminary study designed to establish the validity of
      our modeling approach. A group of 20 participants were asked to play a simple
      computer game, instrumented to log every interaction with the interface.
      Participants had no previous experience with the game's functionality or rules,
      so the activity logs collected during their naive interactions capture patterns
      of exploratory behavior and skill acquisition as they attempted to learn the
      rules of the game. Pre- and post-task questionnaires probed for self-reported
      styles of problem solving, as well as task engagement, difficulty, and workload. 
      We jointly modeled the activity log sequences collected from all participants
      using the BP-HMM approach, identifying a global library of activity patterns
      representative of the collective behavior of all the participants. Analyses show 
      systematic relationships between both pre- and post-task questionnaires,
      self-reported approaches to analytic problem solving, and metrics extracted from 
      the BP-HMM decomposition. Overall, we find that this novel approach to
      decomposing unstructured behavioral data within software environments provides a 
      sensible means for understanding how users learn to integrate software
      functionality for strategic task pursuit.

AB  - Transhumeral amputation has a significant effect on a person's independence and
      quality of life. Myoelectric prostheses have the potential to restore upper limb 
      function, however their use is currently limited due to lack of intuitive and
      natural control of multiple degrees of freedom. The goal of this study was to
      evaluate a novel transhumeral prosthesis controller that uses a combination of
      kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded from the person's proximal
      humerus. Specifically, we trained a time-delayed artificial neural network to
      predict elbow flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination from six
      proximal EMG signals, and humeral angular velocity and linear acceleration. We
      evaluated this scheme with ten able-bodied subjects offline, as well as in a
      target-reaching task presented in an immersive virtual reality environment. The
      offline training had a target of 4 degrees for flexion/extension and 8 degrees
      for pronation/supination, which it easily exceeded (2.7 degrees and 5.5 degrees
      respectively). During online testing, all subjects completed the target-reaching 
      task with path efficiency of 78% and minimal overshoot (1.5%). Thus, combining
      kinematic and muscle activity signals from the proximal humerus can provide
      adequate prosthesis control, and testing in a virtual reality environment can
      provide meaningful data on controller performance.

TI  - Infrared and Visual Image Fusion through Fuzzy Measure and Alternating Operators.
PG  - 17149-67
LID - 10.3390/s150717149 [doi]
AB  - The crucial problem of infrared and visual image fusion is how to effectively
      extract the image features, including the image regions and details and combine
      these features into the final fusion result to produce a clear fused image. To
      obtain an effective fusion result with clear image details, an algorithm for
      infrared and visual image fusion through the fuzzy measure and alternating
      operators is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the alternating operators
      constructed using the opening and closing based toggle operator are analyzed.
      Secondly, two types of the constructed alternating operators are used to extract 
      the multi-scale features of the original infrared and visual images for fusion.
      Thirdly, the extracted multi-scale features are combined through the fuzzy
      measure-based weight strategy to form the final fusion features. Finally, the
      final fusion features are incorporated with the original infrared and visual
      images using the contrast enlargement strategy. All the experimental results
      indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective for infrared and visual image
      fusion.

TI  - More than Just a Game? Combat-Themed Gaming Among Recent Veterans with
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
PG  - 271-7
LID - 10.1089/g4h.2014.0104 [doi]
AB  - This article examines recent combat veterans' experiences of "first-person
      shooter" (FPS) gaming and its relationship to posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). Current PTSD treatment approaches increasingly use virtual reality (VR)
      technologies, which have many similarities with FPS games. To explore these
      similarities, this article presents six case studies from recently separated
      veterans in New York City who reported both current PTSD symptoms and regular use
      of combat-themed FPS games. In open-ended interviews, participants discussed a
      range of benefits as well as the importance of regulating use and avoiding
      particular contextual dimensions of gaming to maintain healthy gaming habits.
      Findings demonstrate the need for more comprehensive study and dissemination of
      best-practices information about FPS gaming in the context of combat-related PTSD
      symptomatology.

TI  - Correcting Congenital Talipes Equinovarus in Children Using Three Different
      Corrective Methods: A Consort Study.
PG  - e1004
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000001004 [doi]
AB  - Equinus, varus, cavus, and adduction are typical signs of congenital talipes
      equinovarus (CTEV). Forefoot adduction remains a difficulty from using previous
      corrective methods. This study aims to develop a corrective method to reduce the 
      severity of forefoot adduction of CTEV children with moderate deformities during 
      their walking age. The devised method was compared with 2 other common corrective
      methods to evaluate its effectiveness. A Dennis Brown (DB) splint, DB splint with
      orthopedic shoes (OS), and forefoot abduct shoes (FAS) with OS were,
      respectively, applied to 15, 20, and 18 CTEV children with moderate deformities
      who were scored at their first visit according to the Dimeglio classification.
      The mean follow-up was 44 months and the orthoses were changed as the children
      grew. A 3D scanner and a high-resolution pedobarograph were used to record
      morphological characteristics and plantar pressure distribution. One-way MAVONA
      analysis was used to compare the bimalleolar angle, bean-shape ratio, and
      pressure ratios in each study group. There were significant differences in the
      FAS+OS group compared to the DB and DB+OS groups (P < 0.05) for most
      measurements. The most salient differences were as follows: the FAS+OS group had 
      a significantly greater bimalleolar angle (P < 0.05) and lower bean-shape ratio
      (P < 0.01) than the other groups; the DB+OS and FAS+OS groups had higher
      heel/forefoot and heel/LMF ratios (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001) than the DB group. FAS
      are critical for correcting improper forefoot adduction and OS are important for 
      the correction of equinus and varus in moderately afflicted CTEV children. This
      study suggests that the use of FAS+OS may improve treatment outcomes for moderate
      CTEV children who do not show signs of serious torsional deformity.

TI  - Upper limb rehabilitation after spinal cord injury: a treatment based on a data
      glove and an immersive virtual reality environment.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Purpose state: The aim of this preliminary study was to test a data glove,
      CyberTouch, combined with a virtual reality (VR) environment, for using in
      therapeutic training of reaching movements after spinal cord injury (SCI).
      METHOD: Nine patients with thoracic SCI were selected to perform a pilot study by
      comparing two treatments: patients in the intervention group (IG) conducted a VR 
      training based on the use of a data glove, CyberTouch for 2 weeks, while patients
      in the control group (CG) only underwent the traditional rehabilitation.
      Furthermore, two functional parameters were implemented in order to assess
      patient's performance of the sessions: normalized trajectory lengths and
      repeatability. RESULTS: Although no statistical significance was found, the data 
      glove group seemed to obtain clinical changes in the muscle balance (MB) and
      functional parameters, and in the dexterity, coordination and fine grip tests.
      Moreover, every patient showed variations in at least one of the functional
      parameters, either along Y-axis trajectory or Z-axis trajectory. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study might be a step forward for the investigation of new uses of motion
      capture systems in neurorehabilitation, making it possible to train activities of
      daily living (ADLs) in motivational environments while measuring objectively the 
      patient's functional evolution. Implications for Rehabilitation Key findings: A
      motion capture application based on a data glove is presented, for being used as 
      a virtual reality tool for rehabilitation. This application has provided
      objective data about patient's functional performance. What the study has added: 
      (1) This study allows to open new areas of research based on the use of different
      motion capture systems as rehabilitation tools, making it possible to train
      Activities of Daily Living in motivational environments. (2) Furthermore, this
      study could be a contribution for the development of clinical protocols to
      identify which types of patients will benefit most from the VR treatments, which 
      interfaces are more suitable to be used in neurorehabilitation, and what types of
      virtual exercises will work best.

TI  - Effects of virtual reality-based training and task-oriented training on balance
      performance in stroke patients.
PG  - 1883-8
LID - 10.1589/jpts.27.1883 [doi]
AB  - [Purpose] This study aimed to investigate the clinical effects of virtual
      reality-based training and task-oriented training on balance performance in
      stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were randomly allocated to 2
      groups: virtual reality-based training group (n = 12) and task-oriented training 
      group (n = 12). The patients in the virtual reality-based training group used the
      Nintendo Wii Fit Plus, which provided visual and auditory feedback as well as the
      movements that enabled shifting of weight to the right and left sides, for 30
      min/day, 3 times/week for 6 weeks. The patients in the task-oriented training
      group practiced additional task-oriented programs for 30 min/day, 3 times/week
      for 6 weeks. Patients in both groups also underwent conventional physical therapy
      for 60 min/day, 5 times/week for 6 weeks. [Results] Balance and functional reach 
      test outcomes were examined in both groups. The results showed that the static
      balance and functional reach test outcomes were significantly higher in the
      virtual reality-based training group than in the task-oriented training group.
      [Conclusion] This study suggested that virtual reality-based training might be a 
      more feasible and suitable therapeutic intervention for dynamic balance in stroke
      patients compared to task-oriented training.

PG  - 1637-40
LID - 10.1589/jpts.27.1637 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to determine the effects of a virtual reality exercise program
      using the Interactive Rehabilitation and Exercise System (IREX) on the recovery
      of motor and cognitive function and the performance of activities of daily living
      in stroke patients. [Subjects] The study enrolled 10 patients diagnosed with
      stroke who received occupational therapy at the Department of Rehabilitation
      Medicine of Hospital A between January and March 2014. [Methods] The patients
      took part in the virtual reality exercise program for 30 minutes each day, three 
      times per week, for 4 weeks. Then, the patients were re-evaluated to determine
      changes in upper extremity function, cognitive function, and performance of
      activities of daily living 4 weeks after the baseline assessment. [Results] In
      the experimental group, there were significant differences in the Korea-Mini
      Mental Status Evaluation, Korean version of the modified Barthel index, and
      Fugl-Meyer assessment scores between the baseline and endpoint. [Conclusion] The 
      virtual reality exercise program was effective for restoring function in stroke
      patients. Further studies should develop systematic protocols for rehabilitation 
      training with a virtual reality exercise program.

TI  - Closed-Loop Behavioral Control Increases Coherence in the Fly Brain.
PG  - 10304-15
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0691-15.2015 [doi]
AB  - A crucial function of the brain is to be able to distinguish whether or not
      changes in the environment are caused by one's own actions. Even the smallest
      brains appear to be capable of making this distinction, as has been shown by
      closed-loop behavioral experiments in flies controlling visual stimuli in virtual
      reality paradigms. We questioned whether activity in the fruit fly brain is
      different during such closed-loop behavior, compared with passive viewing of a
      stimulus. To address this question, we used a procedure to record local field
      potential (LFP) activity across the fly brain while flies were controlling a
      virtual object through their movement on an air-supported ball. The virtual
      object was flickered at a precise frequency (7 Hz), creating a frequency tag that
      allowed us to track brain responses to the object while animals were behaving.
      Following experiments under closed-loop control, we replayed the same stimulus to
      the fly in open loop, such that it could no longer control the stimulus. We found
      identical receptive fields and similar strength of frequency tags across the
      brain for the virtual object under closed loop and replay. However, when
      comparing central versus peripheral brain regions, we found that brain responses 
      were differentially modulated depending on whether flies were in control or not. 
      Additionally, coherence of LFP activity in the brain increased when flies were in
      control, compared with replay, even if motor behavior was similar. This suggests 
      that processes associated with closed-loop control promote temporal coordination 
      in the insect brain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We show that closed-loop control of 
      a visual stimulus promotes temporal coordination across the Drosophila brain,
      compared with open-loop replay of the same visual sequences. This is significant 
      because it suggests that, to understand goal-directed behavior or visual
      attention in flies, it may be most informative to sample neural activity from
      multiple regions across the brain simultaneously, and to examine temporal
      relationships (e.g., coherence) between these regions.

TI  - Three-dimensional immersive virtual reality for studying cellular compartments in
      3D models from EM preparations of neural tissues.
LID - 10.1002/cne.23852 [doi]
AB  - Advances in the application of electron microscopy (EM) to serial imaging are
      opening doors to new ways of analyzing cellular structure. New and improved
      algorithms and workflows for manual and semiautomated segmentation allow us to
      observe the spatial arrangement of the smallest cellular features with
      unprecedented detail in full three-dimensions. From larger samples, higher
      complexity models can be generated; however, they pose new challenges to data
      management and analysis. Here we review some currently available solutions and
      present our approach in detail. We use the fully immersive virtual reality (VR)
      environment CAVE (cave automatic virtual environment), a room in which we are
      able to project a cellular reconstruction and visualize in 3D, to step into a
      world created with Blender, a free, fully customizable 3D modeling software with 
      NeuroMorph plug-ins for visualization and analysis of EM preparations of brain
      tissue. Our workflow allows for full and fast reconstructions of volumes of brain
      neuropil using ilastik, a software tool for semiautomated segmentation of EM
      stacks. With this visualization environment, we can walk into the model
      containing neuronal and astrocytic processes to study the spatial distribution of
      glycogen granules, a major energy source that is selectively stored in
      astrocytes. The use of CAVE was key to the observation of a nonrandom
      distribution of glycogen, and led us to develop tools to quantitatively analyze
      glycogen clustering and proximity to other subcellular features. J. Comp.

AB  - Although virtual reality platforms, such as Second Life, have been used in
      academic settings for more than a decade, little is known about how students
      perceive or adapt to this technology. This article presents the results of a
      research study that examined the experiences and perceptions of graduate nursing 
      students as they explored the educational applications of Second Life. The
      students created avatars, interacted with one another in the virtual world,
      explored healthcare and educational uses, and maintained a reflective blog
      (online journal) of their experiences. Conventional content analysis was used to 
      analyze the reflective blogs, and four themes were identified: (1) mastering
      Second Life, (2) technological challenges, (3) social interaction, and (4)
      knowledge dissemination. The results support the use of virtual reality in
      education, as even novice graduate students were able to overcome initial
      challenges and learn to navigate within a virtual world.

AB  - The physical spaces within which the work of health occurs - the home, the
      intensive care unit, the emergency room, even the bedroom - influence the manner 
      in which behaviors unfold, and may contribute to efficacy and effectiveness of
      health interventions. Yet the study of such complex workspaces is difficult.
      Health care environments are complex, chaotic workspaces that do not lend
      themselves to the typical assessment approaches used in other industrial
      settings. This paper provides two methodological advances for studying internal
      health care environments: a strategy to capture salient aspects of the physical
      environment and a suite of approaches to visualize and analyze that physical
      environment. We used a Faro laser scanner to obtain point cloud data sets of the 
      internal aspects of home environments. The point cloud enables precise
      measurement, including the location of physical boundaries and object perimeters,
      color, and light, in an interior space that can be translated later for
      visualization on a variety of platforms. The work was motivated by vizHOME, a
      multi-year program to intensively examine the home context of personal health
      information management in a way that minimizes repeated, intrusive, and
      potentially disruptive in vivo assessments. Thus, we illustrate how to capture,
      process, display, and analyze point clouds using the home as a specific example
      of a health care environment. Our work presages a time when emerging technologies
      facilitate inexpensive capture and efficient management of point cloud data, thus
      enabling visual and analytical tools for enhanced discharge planning, new
      insights for designers of consumer-facing clinical informatics solutions, and a
      robust approach to context-based studies of health-related work environments.

TI  - Virtual-Reality Simulator System for Double Interventional Cardiac
      Catheterization Using Fractional-Order Vascular Access Tracker and Haptic Force
      Producer.
PG  - 697569
LID - 10.1155/2015/697569 [doi]
AB  - This study proposes virtual-reality (VR) simulator system for double
      interventional cardiac catheterization (ICC) using fractional-order vascular
      access tracker and haptic force producer. An endoscope or a catheter for
      diagnosis and surgery of cardiovascular disease has been commonly used in
      minimally invasive surgery. It needs specific skills and experiences for young
      surgeons or postgraduate year (PGY) students to operate a Berman catheter and a
      pigtail catheter in the inside of the human body and requires avoiding damaging
      vessels. To improve the training in inserting catheters, a double-catheter
      mechanism is designed for the ICC procedures. A fractional-order vascular access 
      tracker is used to trace the senior surgeons' consoled trajectories and transmit 
      the frictional feedback and visual feedback during the insertion of catheters.
      Based on the clinical feeling through the aortic arch, vein into the ventricle,
      or tortuous blood vessels, haptic force producer is used to mock the elasticity
      of the vessel wall using voice coil motors (VCMs). The VR establishment with
      surgeons' consoled vessel trajectories and hand feeling is achieved, and the
      experimental results show the effectiveness for the double ICC procedures.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial to Assess the Effects of Competition on the
      Development of Laparoscopic Surgical Skills.
LID - S1931-7204(15)00157-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jsurg.2015.06.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serious games have demonstrated efficacy in improving participation
      in surgical training activities, but studies have not yet demonstrated the effect
      of serious gaming on performance. This study investigated whether competitive
      training (CT) affects laparoscopic surgical performance. METHODS: A total of 20
      novices were recruited, and 18 (2 dropouts) were randomized into control or CT
      groups to perform 10 virtual reality laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LCs).
      Competitiveness of each participant was assessed. The CT group members were
      informed they were competing to outperform one another for a prize; performance
      ranking was shown before each session. The control group did not compete.
      Performance was assessed on time, movements, and instrument path length. Quality 
      of performance was assessed with a global rating scale score. RESULTS: There were
      no significant intergroup differences in baseline skill or measured
      competitiveness. Time and global rating scale score, at final LC, were not
      significantly different between groups; however, the CT group was significantly
      more dexterous than control and had significantly lower variance in number of
      movements and instrument path length at the final LC (p = 0.019). Contentiousness
      was inversely related to time in the CT group. CONCLUSION: This was the first
      randomized controlled trial to investigate if CT can enhance performance in
      laparoscopic surgery. CT may lead to improved dexterity in laparoscopic surgery
      but yields otherwise similar performance to that of standard training in novices.
      Competition may have different effects on novices vs experienced surgeons, and
      subsequent research should investigate CT in experienced surgeons as well.

TI  - Training effect of a virtual reality haptics-enabled dynamic hip screw simulator.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Background and purpose - Virtual reality (VR) simulation offers a safe,
      controlled, and effective environment to complement training but requires
      extensive validation before it can be implemented within the curriculum. The main
      objective was to assess whether VR dynamic hip screw (DHS) simulation has a
      training effect to improve objective performance metrics. Patients and methods - 
      52 surgical trainees who were naive to DHS procedures were randomized to 2
      groups: the training group, which had 5 attempts, and the control group, which
      had only one attempt. After 1 week, both cohorts repeated the same number of
      attempts. Objective performance metrics included total procedural time (sec),
      fluoroscopy time (sec), number of radiographs (n), tip-apex distance (TAD; mm),
      attempts at guide-wire insertion (n), and probability of cut-out (%). Mean scores
      (with SD) and learning curves were calculated. Significance was set as p < 0.05. 
      Results - The training group was 68% quicker than the control group, used 75%
      less fluoroscopy, took 66% fewer radiographs, had 82% less retries at guide-wire 
      insertion, achieved a reduced TAD (by 41%), had lower probability of cut-out (by 
      85%), and obtained an increased global score (by 63%). All these results were
      statistically significant (p < 0.001). The participants agreed that the simulator
      provided a realistic learning environment, they stated that they had enjoyed
      using the simulator, and they recognized the need for the simulator in formal
      training. Interpretation - We found a significant training effect on the VR DHS
      simulator in improving objective performance metrics of naive surgical trainees. 
      Patient safety, an important priority, was not compromised.

TI  - Pervasive Radio Mapping of Industrial Environments Using a Virtual Reality
      Approach.
PG  - 701848
LID - 10.1155/2015/701848 [doi]
AB  - Wireless communications in industrial environments are seriously affected by
      reliability and performance issues, due to the multipath nature of obstacles
      within such environments. Special attention needs to be given to planning a
      wireless industrial network, so as to find the optimum spatial position for each 
      of the nodes within the network, and especially for key nodes such as gateways or
      cluster heads. The aim of this paper is to present a pervasive radio mapping
      system which captures (senses) data regarding the radio spectrum, using low-cost 
      wireless sensor nodes. This data is the input of radio mapping algorithms that
      generate electromagnetic propagation profiles. Such profiles are used for
      identifying obstacles within the environment and optimum propagation pathways.
      With the purpose of further optimizing the radio planning process, the authors
      propose a novel human-network interaction (HNI) paradigm that uses 3D virtual
      environments in order to display the radio maps in a natural, easy-to-perceive
      manner. The results of this approach illustrate its added value to the field of
      radio resource planning of industrial communication systems.

AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) can reduce time and costs, and lead to increases in quality,
      in the development of a product. Given the pressure on car companies to reduce
      time-to-market and to continually improve quality, the automotive industry has
      championed the use of VR across a number of applications, including design,
      manufacturing, and training. This paper describes interviews with 11 engineers
      and employees of allied disciplines from an automotive manufacturer about their
      current physical and virtual properties and processes. The results guided a
      review of research findings and scientific advances from the academic literature,
      which formed the basis of recommendations for future developments of VR
      technologies and applications. These include: develop a greater range of virtual 
      contexts; use multi-sensory simulation; address perceived differences between
      virtual and real cars; improve motion capture capabilities; implement networked
      3D technology; and use VR for market research.

TI  - A new possibility in thoracoscopic virtual reality simulation training:
      development and testing of a novel virtual reality simulator for video-assisted
      thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy.
PG  - 420-6
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivv183 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to develop virtual reality simulation
      software for video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy, to explore the
      opinions of thoracic surgeons concerning the VATS lobectomy simulator and to test
      the validity of the simulator metrics. METHODS: Experienced VATS surgeons worked 
      with computer specialists to develop a VATS lobectomy software for a virtual
      reality simulator. Thoracic surgeons with different degrees of experience in VATS
      were enrolled at the 22nd meeting of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons
      (ESTS) held in Copenhagen in June 2014. The surgeons were divided according to
      the number of performed VATS lobectomies: novices (0 VATS lobectomies),
      intermediates (1-49 VATS lobectomies) and experienced (>50 VATS lobectomies). The
      participants all performed a lobectomy of a right upper lobe on the simulator and
      answered a questionnaire regarding content validity. Metrics were compared
      between the three groups. RESULTS: We succeeded in developing the first version
      of a virtual reality VATS lobectomy simulator. A total of 103 thoracic surgeons
      completed the simulated lobectomy and were distributed as follows: novices n =
      32, intermediates n = 45 and experienced n = 26. All groups rated the overall
      user realism of the VATS lobectomy scenario to a median of 5 on a scale 1-7, with
      7 being the best score. The experienced surgeons found the graphics and movements
      realistic and rated the scenario high in terms of usefulness as a training tool
      for novice and intermediate experienced thoracic surgeons, but not very useful as
      a training tool for experienced surgeons. The metric scores were not
      statistically significant between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to
      describe a commercially available virtual reality simulator for a VATS lobectomy.
      More than 100 thoracic surgeons found the simulator realistic, and hence it
      showed good content validity. However, none of the built-in simulator metrics
      could significantly distinguish between novice, intermediate experienced and
      experienced surgeons, and further development of the simulator software is
      necessary to develop valid metrics.

AB  - Technological innovations have had a profound influence on how we study the
      sensory perception in humans and other animals. One example was the introduction 
      of affordable computers, which radically changed the nature of visual
      experiments. It is clear that vision research is now at cusp of a similar shift, 
      this time driven by the use of commercially available, low-cost, high-fidelity
      virtual reality (VR). In this review we will focus on: (a) the research questions
      VR allows experimenters to address and why these research questions are
      important, (b) the things that need to be considered when using VR to study human
      perception,
CI  - (c) the drawbacks of current VR systems, and (d) the future direction vision
      research may take, now that VR has become a viable research tool.

TI  - Utility of a Three-Dimensional Interactive Augmented Reality Program for Balance 
      and Mobility Rehabilitation in the Elderly: A Feasibility Study.
PG  - 462-72
LID - 10.5535/arm.2015.39.3.462 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improve lower extremity function and balance in elderly persons, we
      developed a novel, three-dimensional interactive augmented reality system (3D
      ARS). In this feasibility study, we assessed clinical and kinematic improvements,
      user participation, and the side effects of our system. METHODS: Eighteen
      participants (age, 56-76 years) capable of walking independently and standing on 
      one leg were recruited. The participants received 3D ARS training during 10
      sessions (30-minute duration each) for 4 weeks. Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the 
      Timed Up and Go (TUG) scores were obtained before and after the exercises.
      Outcome performance variables, including response time and success rate, and
      kinematic variables, such as hip and knee joint angle, were evaluated after each 
      session. RESULTS: Participants exhibited significant clinical improvements in
      lower extremity balance and mobility following the intervention, as shown by
      improved BBS and TUG scores (p<0.001). Consistent kinematic improvements in the
      maximum joint angles of the hip and knee were observed across sessions. Outcome
      performance variables, such as success rate and response time, improved gradually
      across sessions, for each exercise. The level of participant interest also
      increased across sessions (p<0.001). All participants completed the program
      without experiencing any adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Substantial clinical and
      kinematic improvements were observed after applying a novel 3D ARS training
      program, suggesting that this system can enhance lower extremity function and
      facilitate assessments of lower extremity kinematic capacity.

TI  - Simulator training for endobronchial ultrasound: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1140-9
LID - 10.1183/13993003.02352-2015 [doi]
AB  - Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is
      very operator dependent and has a long learning curve. Simulation-based training 
      might shorten the learning curve, and an assessment tool with solid validity
      evidence could ensure basic competency before unsupervised performance.A total of
      16 respiratory physicians, without EBUS experience, were randomised to either
      virtual-reality simulator training or traditional apprenticeship training on
      patients, and then each physician performed EBUS-TBNA procedures on three
      patients. Three blinded, independent assessor assessed the video recordings of
      the procedures using a newly developed EBUS assessment tool (EBUSAT).The internal
      consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha=0.95); the generalisability coefficient
      was good (0.86), and the tool had discriminatory ability (p<0.001). Procedures
      performed by simulator-trained novices were rated higher than procedures
      performed by apprenticeship-trained novices: mean+/-sd are 24.2+/-7.9 points and 
      20.2+/-9.4 points, respectively; p=0.006. A pass/fail standard of 28.9 points was
      established using the contrasting groups method, resulting in 16 (67%) and 20
      (83%) procedures performed by simulator-trained novices and
      apprenticeship-trained novices failing the test, respectively; p<0.001.The
      endobronchial ultrasound assessment tool could be used to provide reliable and
      valid assessment of competence in EBUS-TBNA, and act as an aid in certification. 
      Virtual-reality simulator training was shown to be more effective than
      traditional apprenticeship training.
