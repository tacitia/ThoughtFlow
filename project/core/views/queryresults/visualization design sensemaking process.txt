TI  - Combining computational analyses and interactive visualization for document
      exploration and sensemaking in jigsaw.
PG  - 1646-63
AB  - Investigators across many disciplines and organizations must sift through large
      collections of text documents to understand and piece together information.
      Whether they are fighting crime, curing diseases, deciding what car to buy, or
      researching a new field, inevitably investigators will encounter text documents. 
      Taking a visual analytics approach, we integrate multiple text analysis
      algorithms with a suite of interactive visualizations to provide a flexible and
      powerful environment that allows analysts to explore collections of documents
      while sensemaking. Our particular focus is on the process of integrating
      automated analyses with interactive visualizations in a smooth and fluid manner. 
      We illustrate this integration through two example scenarios: an academic
      researcher examining InfoVis and VAST conference papers and a consumer exploring 
      car reviews while pondering a purchase decision. Finally, we provide lessons
      learned toward the design and implementation of visual analytics systems for
      document exploration and understanding.
