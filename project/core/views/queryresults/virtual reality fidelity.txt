TI  - The Principles of Magic Applied to Healthcare Simulation.
AB  - STATEMENT: Five principles of magic are described that directly relate to
      enhancing participant engagement in the healthcare simulation setting. The
      principles discussed are the following: reality is in the mind of the
      participant, attention is easily misdirected, perception can be manipulated,
      various cognitive biases can be exploited, and focus must be captured. Using
      these principles in a healthcare simulation can help fill gaps in fidelity and
      bring a participant to a point where the situation and events make sense to them,
      they feel that they are in an appropriate environment, and they are willing to
      forgive the natural flaws of the simulation itself. Misuse of illusions beyond
      the purpose of filling fidelity gaps can break trust with the teacher and lead to
      disengagement of the participant.

TI  - Face and content validity of a virtual-reality simulator for myringotomy with
      tube placement.
PG  - 40
LID - 10.1186/s40463-015-0094-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myringotomy with tube insertion can be challenging for junior
      Otolaryngology residents as it is one of the first microscopic procedures they
      encounter. The Western myringotomy simulator was developed to allow trainees to
      practice microscope positioning, myringotomy, and tube placement. This
      virtual-reality simulator is viewed in stereoscopic 3D, and a haptic device is
      used to manipulate the digital ear model and surgical tools. OBJECTIVE: To assess
      the face and content validity of the Western myringotomy simulator. METHODS: The 
      myringotomy simulator was integrated with new modules to allow speculum
      placement, manipulation of an operative microscope, and insertion of the
      ventilation tube through a deformable tympanic membrane. A questionnaire was
      developed in consultation with instructing surgeons. Fourteen face validity
      questions focused on the anatomy of the ear, simulation of the operative
      microscope, appearance and movement of the surgical instruments, deformation and 
      cutting of the eardrum, and myringotomy tube insertion. Six content validity
      questions focused on training potential on surgical tasks such as speculum
      placement, microscope positioning, tool navigation, ear anatomy, myringotomy
      creation and tube insertion. A total of 12 participants from the Department of
      Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery were recruited for the study. Prior to
      completing the questionnaire, participants were oriented to the simulator and
      given unlimited time to practice until they were comfortable with all of its
      aspects. RESULTS: Responses to 12 of the 14 questions on face validity were
      predominantly positive. One issue of concern was with contact modeling related to
      tube insertion into the eardrum, and the second was with the movement of the
      blade and forceps. The former could be resolved by using a higher resolution
      digital model for the eardrum to improve contact localization. The latter could
      be resolved by using a higher fidelity haptic device. With regard to content
      validity, 64% of the responses were positive, 21% were neutral, and 15% were
      negative. CONCLUSIONS: The Western myringotomy simulator appears to have
      sufficient face and content validity. Further development with automated metrics 
      and skills transference testing is planned.

TI  - Towards immersive virtual reality (iVR): a route to surgical expertise.
LID - 2 [pii]
AB  - Surgery is characterized by complex tasks performed in stressful environments. To
      enhance patient safety and reduce errors, surgeons must be trained in
      environments that mimic the actual clinical setting. Rasmussen's model of human
      behavior indicates that errors in surgical procedures may be skill-, rule-, or
      knowledge-based. While skill-based behavior and some rule-based behavior may be
      taught using box trainers and ex vivo or in vivo animal models, we posit that
      multimodal immersive virtual reality (iVR) that includes high-fidelity visual as 
      well as other sensory feedback in a seamless fashion provides the only means of
      achieving true surgical expertise by addressing all three levels of human
      behavior. While the field of virtual reality is not new, realization of the goals
      of complete immersion is challenging and has been recognized as a Grand Challenge
      by the National Academy of Engineering. Recent technological advances in both
      interface and computational hardware have generated significant enthusiasm in
      this field. In this paper, we discuss convergence of some of these technologies
      and possible evolution of the field in the near term.

TI  - The role of simulation in neurosurgery.
AB  - PURPOSE: In an era of residency duty-hour restrictions, there has been a recent
      effort to implement simulation-based training methods in neurosurgery teaching
      institutions. Several surgical simulators have been developed, ranging from
      physical models to sophisticated virtual reality systems. To date, there is a
      paucity of information describing the clinical benefits of existing simulators
      and the assessment strategies to help implement them into neurosurgical
      curricula. Here, we present a systematic review of the current models of
      simulation and discuss the state-of-the-art and future directions for simulation 
      in neurosurgery. METHODS: Retrospective literature review. RESULTS: Multiple
      simulators have been developed for neurosurgical training, including those for
      minimally invasive procedures, vascular, skull base, pediatric, tumor resection, 
      functional neurosurgery, and spine surgery. The pros and cons of existing systems
      are reviewed. CONCLUSION: Advances in imaging and computer technology have led to
      the development of different simulation models to complement traditional surgical
      training. Sophisticated virtual reality (VR) simulators with haptic feedback and 
      impressive imaging technology have provided novel options for training in
      neurosurgery. Breakthrough training simulation using 3D printing technology holds
      promise for future simulation practice, proving high-fidelity patient-specific
      models to complement residency surgical learning.

TI  - Face, Content, and Construct Validity of Brain Tumor Microsurgery Simulation
      Using a Human Placenta Model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain tumors are complex 3-dimensional lesions. Their resection
      involves training and the use of the multiple microsurgical techniques available 
      for removal. Simulation models, with haptic and visual realism, may be useful for
      improving the bimanual technical skills of neurosurgical residents and
      neurosurgeons, potentially decreasing surgical errors and thus improving patient 
      outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe and assess an ex vivo placental model for brain 
      tumor microsurgery using a simulation tool in neurosurgical psychomotor teaching 
      and assessment. METHODS: Sixteen human placentas were used in this research
      project. Intravascular blood remnants were removed by continuous saline solution 
      irrigation of the 2 placental arteries and placental vein. Brain tumors were
      simulated using silicone injections in the placental stroma. Eight neurosurgeons 
      and 8 neurosurgical residents carried out the resection of simulated tumors using
      the same surgical instruments and bimanual microsurgical techniques used to
      perform human brain tumor operations. Face and content validity was assessed
      using a subjective evaluation based on a 5-point Likert scale. Construct validity
      was assessed by analyzing the surgical performance of the neurosurgeon and
      resident groups. RESULTS: The placenta model simulated brain tumor surgical
      procedures with high fidelity. Results showed face and content validity.
      Construct validity was demonstrated by statistically different surgical
      performances among the evaluated groups. CONCLUSION: Human placentas are useful
      haptic models to simulate brain tumor microsurgical removal. Results using this
      model demonstrate face, content, and construct validity. ABBREVIATION: VR,
      virtual reality.

TI  - Preliminary evaluation of a virtual reality dental simulation system on drilling 
      operation.
PG  - S747-56
LID - 10.3233/BME-151366 [doi]
AB  - To evaluate the fidelity of the iDental system and investigate its utility and
      performance on simulated drilling operations, user studies consisting of
      objective and subjective evaluations were performed. A voxel-based drilling
      simulation sub-system in the iDental system was employed for evaluation. Twenty
      participants were enrolled to take part in the experiments and were divided into 
      two groups: novice and resident. A combined evaluation method including objective
      and subjective methods was employed. The objective evaluation included two dental
      drilling tasks: caries removal operation and pulp chamber opening operation. In
      the subjective method, participants were required to complete a questionnaire to 
      evaluate the fidelity of the system after the operation task. Based on the
      structured global assessment scales in the questionnaire, the average subjective 
      evaluation scores of the proposed metrics were greater than 4.5, demonstrating
      that the system operated above medium fidelity. Dentists expressed great interest
      and positive attitudes toward the potential of the iDental system. The objective 
      evaluation data including time spent and the volume of removed healthy and
      carious tissue were obtained. Although no significant differences could be found 
      between the two groups, the volume of removed caries and the depth of pulp
      chamber insertion manifested small standard deviations. Evaluation results
      illustrated that dentists were willing to use the virtual reality training
      system. Several future research topics were identified, including increasing the 
      task difficulty, improving the system fidelity and introducing appropriate finger
      rest points.

PG  - 1377-89
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2480060 [doi]
AB  - When human actors interact with virtual objects the result is often not
      convincing to a third party viewer, due to incongruities between the actor and
      object positions. In this study we aim to quantify the magnitude and impact of
      the errors that occur in a bimanual interaction, that is when an actor attempts
      to move a virtual object by holding it between both hands. A three stage
      framework is presented which firstly captures the magnitude of these interaction 
      errors, then quantifies their effect on the relevant third party audience, and
      thirdly assesses methods to mitigate the impact of the errors. Findings from this
      work show that the degree of error was dependent on the size of the virtual
      object and also on the axis of the hand placement with respect to the axis of the
      interactive motion. In addition, actor hand placement outside and away from the
      object surface was found to affect the visual plausibility considerably more than
      when the actor's hands were within the object boundaries. Finally, a method for
      automatic adaptation of the object size to match the distance between the actor's
      hands gave a significant improvement in the viewers' assessment of the scene
      plausibility.

TI  - "What Are You Thinking When You Look at Me?" A Pilot Study of the Use of Virtual 
      Reality in Body Image.
AB  - Body image disturbance (BID) is implicated in the etiology, maintenance, and
      relapse of the eating disorders, and remains challenging to treat. New paradigms 
      such as virtual reality (VR) may offer an ecologically viable method to assess
      and treat BID. This pilot study aimed to determine if a VR environment could
      elicit increased BID in a nonclinical group of women who were dieting due to body
      image concerns or nonclinical women who were not dieting. Forty-one nonclinical
      females participated in the VR paradigm (a London Bus Journey), completing pre
      and post measures of body image satisfaction, and social evaluative concerns.
      Results did not support the hypothesis that the virtual London Bus would elicit
      increased BID. However, dieters reported significantly higher levels of social
      evaluative concerns and comparison to avatars during the virtual environment
      compared with nondieters. Participants reported acceptable levels of sense of
      presence and enjoyment of the VR environment. Possible explanations for the
      failure of the VR environment to trigger increased BID are discussed, including
      choice of environment and avatar fidelity. In conclusion, this pilot study

      Effectiveness for a Visual Scanning Task.
PG  - 794-807
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2403312 [doi]
AB  - Virtual reality training systems are commonly used in a variety of domains, and
      it is important to understand how the realism of a training simulation influences
      training effectiveness. We conducted a controlled experiment to test the effects 
      of display and scenario properties on training effectiveness for a visual
      scanning task in a simulated urban environment. The experiment varied the levels 
      of field of view and visual complexity during a training phase and then evaluated
      scanning performance with the simulator's highest levels of fidelity and scene
      complexity. To assess scanning performance, we measured target detection and
      adherence to a prescribed strategy. The results show that both field of view and 
      visual complexity significantly affected target detection during training; higher
      field of view led to better performance and higher visual complexity worsened
      performance. Additionally, adherence to the prescribed visual scanning strategy
      during assessment was best when the level of visual complexity during training
      matched that of the assessment conditions, providing evidence that similar visual
      complexity was important for learning the technique. The results also demonstrate
      that task performance during training was not always a sufficient measure of
      mastery of an instructed technique. That is, if learning a prescribed strategy or
      skill is the goal of a training exercise, performance in a simulation may not be 
      an appropriate indicator of effectiveness outside of training-evaluation in a
      more realistic setting may be necessary.

PG  - 355-9
LID - 10.1097/MOO.0000000000000181 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The field of temporal bone simulation (TBS) has largely
      focused on the development and validation of simulators as training and
      assessment tools. As technology has progressed over the years, researchers have, 
      however, envisioned new clinical applications for simulators extending to
      preoperative surgical planning and case rehearsal. The purpose of this article
      was to review the current state of the art in TBS and to highlight recent
      advancements in the field. Because of space limitations, we will limit our
      discussion to computer-based virtual reality simulators. RECENT FINDINGS: A
      review of the recent literature on TBS revealed very limited application of
      virtual reality simulators for preoperative preparation. Current evidence
      suggests limitations in fidelity preclude successful patient-specific case
      rehearsal using virtual reality simulation. Further investigation and clinical
      evaluation are required to validate its use outside of training and skill
      assessment. SUMMARY: This article provides an overview of the current use of
      virtual reality simulators with emphasis on preoperative planning. We evaluate
      the limitations of the technology, and discuss potential areas of improvement for
      the future. More studies are necessary to assess the value of virtual reality
      simulation for preoperative preparation.

AB  - Recent proliferation of available virtual reality (VR) tools has seen increased
      use in psychological research. This is due to a number of advantages afforded
      over traditional experimental apparatus such as tighter control of the
      environment and the possibility of creating more ecologically valid stimulus
      presentation and response protocols. At the same time, higher levels of immersion
      and visual fidelity afforded by VR do not necessarily evoke presence or elicit a 
      "realistic" psychological response. The current paper reviews some current uses
      for VR environments in psychological research and discusses some ongoing
      questions for researchers. Finally, we focus on the area of visual perception,
      where both the advantages and challenges of VR are particularly salient.

AB  - Technological innovations have had a profound influence on how we study the
      sensory perception in humans and other animals. One example was the introduction 
      of affordable computers, which radically changed the nature of visual
      experiments. It is clear that vision research is now at cusp of a similar shift, 
      this time driven by the use of commercially available, low-cost, high-fidelity
      virtual reality (VR). In this review we will focus on: (a) the research questions
      VR allows experimenters to address and why these research questions are
      important, (b) the things that need to be considered when using VR to study human
      perception,
CI  - (c) the drawbacks of current VR systems, and (d) the future direction vision
      research may take, now that VR has become a viable research tool.

TI  - Intra-operative disruptions, surgeon's mental workload, and technical performance
      in a full-scale simulated procedure.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Surgical flow disruptions occur frequently and jeopardize
      perioperative care and surgical performance. So far, insights into subjective and
      cognitive implications of intra-operative disruptions for surgeons and inherent
      consequences for performance are inconsistent. This study aimed to investigate
      the effect of surgical flow disruption on surgeon's intra-operative workload and 
      technical performance. METHODS: In a full-scale OR simulation, 19 surgeons were
      randomly allocated to either of the two disruption scenarios (telephone call vs. 
      patient discomfort). Using a mixed virtual reality simulator with a computerized,
      high-fidelity mannequin, all surgeons were trained in performing a vertebroplasty
      procedure and subsequently performed such a procedure under experimental
      conditions. Standardized measures on subjective workload and technical
      performance (trocar positioning deviation from expert-defined standard, number,
      and duration of X-ray acquisitions) were collected. RESULTS: Intra-operative
      workload during simulated disruption scenarios was significantly higher compared 
      to training sessions (p < .01). Surgeons in the telephone call scenario
      experienced significantly more distraction compared to their colleagues in the
      patient discomfort scenario (p < .05). However, workload tended to be increased
      in surgeons who coped with distractions due to patient discomfort. Technical
      performance was not significantly different between both disruption scenarios. We
      found a significant association between surgeons' intra-operative workload and
      technical performance such that surgeons with increased mental workload tended to
      perform worse (beta = .55, p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical flow disruptions
      affect surgeons' intra-operative workload. Increased mental workload was
      associated with inferior technical performance. Our simulation-based findings
      emphasize the need to establish smooth surgical flow which is characterized by a 
      low level of process deviations and disruptions.

AB  - Character of clinical skills training is always influenced by technical
      improvement and cultural changes. Over the last years, two trends have changed
      the way of traditional apprenticeship-style training in regional anaesthesia:
      firstly, the development in ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia, and secondly,
      the reduced acceptance of using patients as mannequins for invasive techniques.
      Against this background, simulation techniques are explored, ranging from simple 
      low-fidelity part-task training models to train skills in needle application, to 
      highly sophisticated virtual reality models - the full range is covered. This
      review tries to discuss all available options with benefits and neglects. The
      task in clinical practice will be in choosing the right level of sophistication
      for the desired approach and trainee level. However, the transfer of simulated
      skills to clinical practice has not been evaluated. It has to be proven whether
      simulation-trained skills could, as a last consequence, reduce the risk to
      patients.

AB  - The design of an industrial workstation tends to include ergonomic assessment
      steps based on a digital mock-up and a virtual reality setup. Lack of interaction
      and system fidelity is often reported as a main issue in such virtual reality
      applications. This limitation is a crucial issue as thorough ergonomic analysis
      is required for an investigation of the biomechanics. In the current study, we
      investigated the biomechanical responses of the shoulder joint in a simulated
      assembly task for comparison with the biomechanical responses in virtual
      environments. Sixteen male healthy novice subjects performed the task on three
      different platforms: real (RE), virtual (VE), and virtual environment with force 
      feedback (VEF) with low and high precision demands. The subjects repeated the
      task 12 times (i.e., 12 cycles). High density electromyography from the upper
      trapezius and rotation angles of the shoulder joint were recorded and split into 
      the cycles. The angular trajectories and velocity profiles of the shoulder joint 
      angles over a cycle were computed in 3D. The inter-subject similarity in terms of
      normalized mutual information on kinematics and electromyography was
      investigated. Compared with RE the task in VE and VEF was characterized by lower 
      kinematic maxima. The inter-subject similarity in RE compared with intra-subject 
      similarity across the platforms was lower in terms of movement trajectories and
      greater in terms of trapezius muscle activation. The precision demand resulted in
      lower inter- and intra-subject similarity across platforms. The proposed approach
      identifies biomechanical differences in the shoulder joint in both VE and VEF
      compared with the RE platform, but these differences are less marked in VE mostly
      due to technical limitations of co-localizing the force feedback system in the
      VEF platform.

AB  - The Math Interactive Learning Experience (MILE), a program designed to address
      academic and behavioral problems found in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
      Disorders (FASD), was found to be effective in a randomized clinical trials with 
      results that persisted at a 6-month follow-up. The current study evaluated the
      effectiveness of a community translation, in partnership with several community
      sites in the metropolitan Atlanta area. A total of 60 participants were randomly 
      assigned to one of the three treatment groups: the MILE program administered at a
      specialty care center (Center MILE) or in the community (Community MILE), or to
      parent math instruction only (Parent Instruction). This study evaluated
      instructor satisfaction with the training program, knowledge related to FASD and 
      the MILE program, adherence to the MILE teaching methodology, participant math
      outcomes, and parents' satisfaction with their treatment experience. Instructors 
      reported a high degree of satisfaction with the overall training and mean site
      fidelity ratings were positively correlated with change in math performance.
      Those in the MILE intervention groups demonstrated more positive gains in math
      skills than those in the Parent Instruction group but did not differ from each
      other. Parents in the Parent Instruction group reported less satisfaction with
      their intervention than those assigned to the Center MILE group but satisfaction 
      ratings did not differ between those in the MILE intervention groups. These
      results indicate that the community translation and the MILE instructor training 
      program developed as part of this process were well-received and effective in

TI  - Role of transurethral resection of the prostate simulators for training in
      transurethral surgery.
PG  - 153-7
LID - 10.1097/MOU.0000000000000141 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Transurethral surgery is an art unique to urologists;
      mastering the craft is essential for day-to-day practice. Medical treatment along
      with minimally invasive treatments have significantly reduced the number of
      transurethral resection of prostates. Decrease in resident's training hours,
      expanding subspecialties and the emergence of newer technologies have burdened
      the trainees who are trying to digest the ever-expanding medical literature.
      Moreover, expectations from patients and insurance companies with a stress on
      cutting costs and raising litigations have brought changes in apprentice-based to
      simulator-based training. We studied the role of transurethral resection of
      prostate simulators in training of transurethral surgery. RECENT FINDINGS: TURP
      simulators from bench to virtual reality computer models are available. Most of
      them have undergone face, content and construct validity. Nontechnical skills
      training is also important hence simulation to simulator training. Simulation
      programmes incorporating communication, team building, minimizing errors caused
      by distraction and managing complex situations can turn a novice into an expert
      with adequate practice in a stress-free environment. Work is also done to define 
      learning curve, and factors affecting the path to reach the desired goal.
      Concepts are emerging to integrate simulators and simulation into the existing
      training programmes. SUMMARY: TURP simulators are essential for training in
      transurethral surgery. Low or high-fidelity simulators do not matter, but having 
      a well structured simulation programme, under the scrutiny of a dedicated trained
      faculty, will address most of the issues related to training in transurethral
      surgery, an art essential for urologists irrespective of the subspecialty one
      pursues in the future.

TI  - The centricity of presence in scenario-based high fidelity human patient
      simulation: a model.
PG  - 64-73
LID - 10.1177/0894318414558605 [doi]
AB  - Enhancing immersive presence has been shown to have influence on learning
      outcomes in virtual types of simulation. Scenario-based human patient simulation,
      a mixed reality form, may pose unique challenges for inducing the centricity of
      presence among participants in simulation. A model for enhancing the centricity
      of presence in scenario-based human patient simulation is presented here. The
      model represents a theoretical linkage among the interaction of pedagogical,
      individual, and group factors that influence the centricity of presence among
      participants in simulation. Presence may have an important influence on the
      learning experiences and learning outcomes in scenario-based high fidelity human 
      patient simulation. This report is a follow-up to an article published in 2014 by
      the author where connections were made to the theoretical basis of presence as
      articulated by nurse scholars.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Considerable resources have been invested in low- and high-fidelity
      simulators in surgical training. To our knowledge, no investigation has compared 
      the 2 head to head for operative assessment purposes. The purpose of this study
      was to assess the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) low-fidelity video
      trainer and LapVR (high-fidelity virtual-reality simulator) for (1) construct and
      (2) predictive validity using a human cholecystectomy model. METHODS: Twenty-six 
      participants performed tasks from the FLS program and the LapVR simulator as well
      as a human laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Performance was evaluated using FLS and 
      LapVR metrics and the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills
      previously validated rating scale. RESULTS: Construct and predictive validity
      were strongly demonstrated for FLS tasks but only incompletely for LapVR.
      CONCLUSIONS: Efforts should be focused on using the well-validated lower-cost FLS
      video trainer for assessment of laparoscopic skills. The high-cost LapVR remains 
      experimental in resource-constrained training programs.

TI  - Development and preliminary evaluation of a novel low cost VR-based upper limb
      stroke rehabilitation platform using Wii technology.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - Abstract Purpose: This paper proposes a novel system (using the Nintendo Wii
      remote) that offers customised, non-immersive, virtual reality-based, upper-limb 
      stroke rehabilitation and reports on promising preliminary findings with stroke
      survivors. Method: The system novelty lies in the high accuracy of the full
      kinematic tracking of the upper limb movement in real-time, offering strong
      personal connection between the stroke survivor and a virtual character when
      executing therapist prescribed adjustable exercises/games. It allows the
      therapist to monitor patient performance and to individually calibrate the system
      in terms of range of movement, speed and duration. Results: The system was tested
      for acceptability with three stroke survivors with differing levels of
      disability. Participants reported an overwhelming connection with the system and 
      avatar. A two-week, single case study with a long-term stroke survivor showed
      positive changes in all four outcome measures employed, with the participant
      reporting better wrist control and greater functional use. Activities, which were
      deemed too challenging or too easy were associated with lower scores of
      enjoyment/motivation, highlighting the need for activities to be individually
      calibrated. Conclusions: Given the preliminary findings, it would be beneficial
      to extend the case study in terms of duration and participants and to conduct an 
      acceptability and feasibility study with community dwelling survivors.
      Implications for Rehabilitation Low-cost, off-the-shelf game sensors, such as the
      Nintendo Wii remote, are acceptable by stroke survivors as an add-on to upper
      limb stroke rehabilitation but have to be bespoked to provide high-fidelity and
      real-time kinematic tracking of the arm movement. Providing therapists with
      real-time and remote monitoring of the quality of the movement and not just the
      amount of practice, is imperative and most critical for getting a better
      understanding of each patient and administering the right amount and type of
      exercise. The ability to translate therapeutic arm movement into individually
      calibrated exercises and games, allows accommodation of the wide range of
      movement difficulties seen after stroke and the ability to adjust these
      activities (in terms of speed, range of movement and duration) will aid
      motivation and adherence - key issues in rehabilitation. With increasing
      pressures on resources and the move to more community-based rehabilitation, the
      proposed system has the potential for promoting the intensity of practice
      necessary for recovery in both community and acute settings.

TI  - Improving residency training in arthroscopic knee surgery with use of a
      virtual-reality simulator. A randomized blinded study.
PG  - 1798-806
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.N.00058 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of articles in the surgical literature
      demonstrating transfer validity (transfer of training). The purpose of this study
      was to assess whether skills learned on the ArthroSim virtual-reality
      arthroscopic knee simulator transferred to greater skill levels in the operating 
      room. METHODS: Postgraduate year-3 orthopaedic residents were randomized into
      simulator-trained and control groups at seven academic institutions. The
      experimental group trained on the simulator, performing a knee diagnostic
      arthroscopy procedure to a predetermined proficiency level based on the average
      proficiency of five community-based orthopaedic surgeons performing the same
      procedure on the simulator. The residents in the control group continued their
      institution-specific orthopaedic education and training. Both groups then
      performed a diagnostic knee arthroscopy procedure on a live patient. Video
      recordings of the arthroscopic surgery were analyzed by five pairs of expert
      arthroscopic surgeons blinded to the identity of the residents. A proprietary
      global rating scale and a procedural checklist, which included visualization and 
      probing scales, were used for rating. RESULTS: Forty-eight (89%) of the
      fifty-four postgraduate year-3 residents from seven academic institutions
      completed the study. The simulator-trained group averaged eleven hours of
      training on the simulator to reach proficiency. The simulator-trained group
      performed significantly better when rated according to our procedural checklist
      (p = 0.031), including probing skills (p = 0.016) but not visualization skills (p
      = 0.34), compared with the control group. The procedural checklist weighted
      probing skills double the weight of visualization skills. The global rating scale
      failed to reach significance (p = 0.061) because of one extreme outlier. The
      duration of the procedure was not significant. This lack of a significant
      difference seemed to be related to the fact that residents in the control group
      were less thorough, which shortened their time to completion of the arthroscopic 
      procedure. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated transfer validity (transfer of
      training) that residents trained to proficiency on a high-fidelity realistic
      virtual-reality arthroscopic knee simulator showed a greater skill level in the
      operating room compared with the control group. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We believe
      that the results of our study will stimulate residency program directors to
      incorporate surgical simulation into the core curriculum of their residency
      programs.

TI  - Design and evaluation of a new synthetic brain simulator for endoscopic third
      ventriculostomy.
PG  - 82-8
LID - 10.3171/2014.9.PEDS1447 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an effective but technically
      demanding procedure with significant risk. Current simulators, including human
      cadavers, animal models, and virtual reality systems, are expensive, relatively
      inaccessible, and can lack realistic sensory feedback. The purpose of this study 
      was to construct a realistic, low-cost, reusable brain simulator for ETV and
      evaluate its fidelity. METHODS: A brain silicone replica mimicking normal
      mechanical properties of a 4-month-old child with hydrocephalus was constructed, 
      encased in the replicated skull, and immersed in water. Realistic
      intraventricular landmarks included the choroid plexus, veins, mammillary bodies,
      infundibular recess, and basilar artery. The thinned-out third ventricle floor,
      which dissects appropriately, is quickly replaceable. Standard neuroendoscopic
      equipment including irrigation is used. Bleeding scenarios are also incorporated.
      A total of 16 neurosurgical trainees (Postgraduate Years 1-6) and 9 pediatric and
      adult neurosurgeons tested the simulator. All participants filled out
      questionnaires (5-point Likert-type items) to rate the simulator for face and
      content validity. RESULTS: The simulator is portable, robust, and sets up in
      minutes. More than 95% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the
      simulator's anatomical features, tissue properties, and bleeding scenarios were a
      realistic representation of that seen during an ETV. Participants stated that the
      simulator helped develop the required hand-eye coordination and camera skills,
      and the training exercise was valuable. CONCLUSIONS: A low-cost, reusable,
      silicone-based ETV simulator realistically represents the surgical procedure to
      trainees and neurosurgeons. It can help them develop the technical and cognitive 
      skills for ETV including dealing with complications.

AB  - In virtual surgery of minimally invasive vascular intervention, the force
      feedback is transmitted through the flexible guide wire. The disturbance caused
      by the flexible deformation would affect the fidelity of the VR (virtual reality)
      training. SMC (sliding mode control) strategy with delayed-output observer is
      adopted to suppress the effect of flexible deformation. In this study, the
      control performance of the strategy is assessed when the length of guide wire
      between actuator and the operating point changes. The performance assessment
      results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and find the optimal
      length of guide wire for the force feedback control.

TI  - Development of the McGill simulator for endoscopic sinus surgery: a new
      high-fidelity virtual reality simulator for endoscopic sinus surgery.
PG  - 330-4
LID - 10.2500/ajra.2014.28.4046 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The technical challenges of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and the
      high risk of complications support the development of alternative modalities to
      train residents in these procedures. Virtual reality simulation is becoming a
      useful tool for training the skills necessary for minimally invasive surgery;
      however, there are currently no ESS virtual reality simulators available with
      valid evidence supporting their use in resident education. Our aim was to develop
      a new rhinology simulator, as well as to define potential performance metrics for
      trainee assessment. METHODS: The McGill simulator for endoscopic sinus surgery
      (MSESS), a new sinus surgery virtual reality simulator with haptic feedback, was 
      developed (a collaboration between the McGill University Department of
      Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, the Montreal Neurologic Institute
      Simulation Lab, and the National Research Council of Canada). A panel of experts 
      in education, performance assessment, rhinology, and skull base surgery convened 
      to identify core technical abilities that would need to be taught by the
      simulator, as well as performance metrics to be developed and captured. RESULTS: 
      The MSESS allows the user to perform basic sinus surgery skills, such as an
      ethmoidectomy and sphenoidotomy, through the use of endoscopic tools in a virtual
      nasal model. The performance metrics were developed by an expert panel and
      include measurements of safety, quality, and efficiency of the procedure.
      CONCLUSION: The MSESS incorporates novel technological advancements to create a
      realistic platform for trainees. To our knowledge, this is the first simulator to
      combine novel tools such as the endonasal wash and elaborate anatomic deformity
      with advanced performance metrics for ESS.

TI  - Simulation-based ureteroscopy training: a systematic review.
PG  - 135-43
LID - 10.1016/j.jsurg.2014.07.003 [doi]
LID - S1931-7204(14)00203-7 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Simulation is a common adjunct to operative training and various
      modalities exist for ureteroscopy. This systematic review aims the following: (1)
      to identify available ureteroscopy simulators, (2) to explore evidence for their 
      effectiveness using characteristic criterion, and (3) to provide recommendations 
      for simulation-based ureteroscopy training. DESIGN: The preferred reporting items
      for systematic reviews and meta-analysis statement guidelines were used. A
      literature search was performed using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library
      databases. RESULTS: In total, 20 articles concerning ureteroscopy simulators were
      included. Overall, 3 high-fidelity bench models are available. The Uro-Scopic
      Trainer has demonstrated face, construct, and concurrent validity, whereas the
      Scope Trainer has undergone content, construct, and predictive validation. The
      adult ureteroscopy trainer has demonstrated face, content, and construct
      validity. The URO Mentor is the only available ureteroscopy virtual-reality
      system; 10 studies were identified demonstrating its face, content, construct,
      concurrent, and predictive validity. The Uro-Scopic Trainer, the Scope Trainer,
      and the URO Mentor have demonstrated high educational impact. A noncommercially
      available, low-fidelity model has demonstrated effectiveness comparable to its
      high-fidelity counterpart at 185 times lesser than the price of the Uro-Scopic
      Trainer. The use of porcine models has also been described in 3 studies but
      require further study. CONCLUSIONS: Valid models are available for
      simulation-based ureteroscopy training. However, there is a lack of many
      high-level studies conducted, and further investigation is required in this area.
      Furthermore, current research focuses on the technical skills acquisition with
      little research conducted on nontechnical skills acquisition within ureteroscopy.
      The next step for ureteroscopy training is a formalized and validated curriculum,
      incorporating simulation, training models, development of nontechnical skills,
      and real-life practice.

TI  - Promiscuous methionyl-tRNA synthetase mediates adaptive mistranslation to protect
      cells against oxidative stress.
PG  - 4234-45
LID - 10.1242/jcs.152470 [doi]
AB  - Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) acylate transfer (t)RNAs with amino acids.
      Charging tRNAs with the right amino acids is the first step in translation;
      therefore, the accurate and error-free functioning of ARSs is an essential
      prerequisite for translational fidelity. A recent study found that methionine
      (Met) can be incorporated into non-Met residues of proteins through
      methionylation of non-cognate tRNAs under conditions of oxidative stress.
      However, it was not understood how this mis-methionylation is achieved. Here, we 
      report that methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MRS) is phosphorylated at Ser209 and
      Ser825 by extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2) under conditions of stress
      caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and that this phosphorylated MRS shows
      increased affinity for non-cognate tRNAs with lower affinity for tRNA(Met),
      leading to an increase in Met residues in cellular proteins. The expression of a 
      mutant MRS containing the substitutions S209D and S825D, mimicking dual
      phosphorylation, reduced ROS levels and cell death. This controlled inaccuracy of
      MRS seems to serve as a defense mechanism against ROS-mediated damage at the cost
      of translational fidelity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare the validity of
      high-fidelity and low-fidelity simulators in a selection center environment,
      using measures of construct and concurrent validity. METHODS: A total of 46
      novice and expert participants were tested on both the low-fidelity Fundamentals 
      of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) box trainer and the high fidelity, Lapsim, virtual 
      reality laparoscopic simulator. Outcome scores and performance metrics where
      recorded. RESULTS: Experts performed better than novices on the FLS (median 71%
      vs. 51%; P<0.0001) but not the Lapsim (59.1% vs. 57.1%; P = 0.41). No correlation
      was found between overall Lapsim metrics and FLS outcome scores (correlation =
      -0.024; P = 0.874). Although most novice participants performed within a narrow
      window on the FLS simulator, a few high-performing and low-performing outliers
      where identified. CONCLUSIONS: In a selection center scenario, testing with
      low-fidelity platforms appears to demonstrate greater validity. Outliers can be
      identified using low-fidelity simulators.

TI  - Role of simulation in training the next generation of endoscopists.
PG  - 234-9
LID - 10.4253/wjge.v6.i6.234 [doi]
AB  - The use of simulation based training in endoscopy has been increasingly
      described, simulation has the potential reduce the harm caused to patients by
      novices performing procedures, increase efficiency by reducing the time needed to
      train in the clinical environment and increase the opportunity to repeatedly
      practice rare procedures as well as allowing the assessment of performance.
      Simulators can consist of mechanical devices, employ cadaveric animal tissue or
      use virtual reality technology. Simulators have been used to teach upper and
      lower gastrointestinal endoscopy as well as interventional procedures. This
      review reviews the currently available endoscopic simulators, and the evidence
      for their efficacy, demonstrating that the ability of simulators to differentiate
      between novice and expert endoscopists is well established. There is limited
      evidence for improved patient outcome as a result of simulation training. We also
      consider how the environment within which a simulation is placed can be
      manipulated to alter the learning achieved, broadening the scope of simulation to
      develop communication as well as technical skills. Finally the implications for
      future practice are considered; technology is likely improve the fidelity of
      simulators, increasing the potential for simulation to improve patient outcomes. 
      The impact of the simulation environment, and the correct place of simulation
      within the training curriculum are both issues which need addressing.

TI  - Effects of simulation fidelity on user experience in virtual fear of public
      speaking training - an experimental study.
PG  - 66-70
AB  - Realistic models in virtual reality training applications are considered to
      positively influence presence and performance. The experimental study presented, 
      analyzed the effect of simulation fidelity (static vs. animated audience) on
      presence as a prerequisite for performance in a prototype virtual fear of public 
      speaking application with a sample of N = 40 academic non-phobic users. Contrary 
      to the state of research, no influence was shown on virtual presence and
      perceived realism, but an animated audience led to significantly higher effects
      in anxiety during giving a talk. Although these findings could be explained by an
      application that might not have been realistic enough, they still question the
      role of presence as a mediating factor in virtual exposure applications.

TI  - Assessment of performance measures and learning curves for use of a
      virtual-reality ultrasound simulator in transvaginal ultrasound examination.
PG  - 693-9
LID - 10.1002/uog.13400 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity and reliability of performance measures,
      develop credible performance standards and explore learning curves for a
      virtual-reality simulator designed for transvaginal gynecological ultrasound
      examination. METHODS: A group of 16 ultrasound novices, along with a group of 12 
      obstetrics/gynecology (Ob/Gyn) consultants, were included in this experimental
      study. The first two performances of the two groups on seven selected modules on 
      a high-fidelity ultrasound simulator were used to identify valid and reliable
      metrics. Performance standards were determined and novices were instructed to
      continue practicing until they attained the performance level of an expert
      subgroup (n = 4). RESULTS: All 28 participants completed the selected modules
      twice and all novices reached the expert performance level. Of 153 metrics, 48
      were able to be used to discriminate between the two groups' performance. The
      ultrasound novices scored a median of 43.8% (range, 17.9-68.9%) and the Ob/Gyn
      consultants scored a median of 82.8% (range, 60.4-91.7%) of the maximum sum score
      (P < 0.001). The ultrasound novices reached the expert level (88.4%) within a
      median of five iterations (range, 5-6), corresponding to an average of 219 min
      (range, 150-251 min) of training. The test/retest reliability was high, with an
      intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.93. CONCLUSIONS: Competence in the
      performance of gynecological ultrasound examination can be assessed in a valid
      and reliable way using virtual-reality simulation. The novices' performance
      improved with practice and their learning curves plateaued at the level of expert
      performance, following between 3 and 4 h of simulator training.

TI  - The effect of fidelity: how expert behavior changes in a virtual reality
      environment.
PG  - 2144-50
LID - 10.1002/lary.24708 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: We compare the behavior of expert surgeons operating on
      the "gold standard" of simulation-the cadaveric temporal bone-against a
      high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) simulation. We aim to determine whether expert
      behavior changes within the virtual environment and to understand how the
      fidelity of simulation affects users' behavior. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Five
      expert otologists performed cortical mastoidectomy and cochleostomy on a human
      cadaveric temporal bone and a VR temporal bone simulator. Hand movement and video
      recordings were used to derive a range of measures, to facilitate an analysis of 
      surgical technique, and to compare expert behavior between the cadaveric and
      simulator environments. RESULTS: Drilling time was similar across the two
      environments. Some measures such as total time and burr change count differed
      predictably due to the ease of switching burrs within the simulator. Surgical
      strokes were generally longer in distance and duration in VR, but these measures 
      changed proportionally to cadaveric measures across the stages of the procedure. 
      Stroke shape metrics differed, which was attributed to the modeling of burr
      behavior within the simulator. This will be corrected in future versions.
      CONCLUSION: Slight differences in drill interaction between a virtual environment
      and the real world can have measurable effects on surgical technique,
      particularly in terms of stroke length, duration, and curvature. It is important 
      to understand these effects when designing and implementing surgical training
      programs based on VR simulation--and when improving the fidelity of VR simulators
      to facilitate use of a similar technique in both real and simulated situations.

TI  - Feasibility of training athletes for high-pressure situations using virtual
      reality.
PG  - 606-15
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2014.23 [doi]
AB  - Virtual reality (VR) has been successfully applied to a broad range of training
      domains; however, to date there is little research investigating its benefits for
      sport psychology training. We hypothesized that using high-fidelity VR systems to
      display realistic 3D sport environments could trigger anxiety, allowing
      resilience-training systems to prepare athletes for real-world, highpressure
      situations. In this work we investigated the feasibility and usefulness of using 
      VR for sport psychology training. We developed a virtual soccer goalkeeping
      application for the Virginia Tech Visionarium VisCube (a CAVE-like display
      system), in which users defend against simulated penalty kicks using their own
      bodies. Using the application, we ran a controlled, within-subjects experiment
      with three independent variables: known anxiety triggers, field of regard, and
      simulation fidelity. The results demonstrate that a VR sport-oriented system can 
      induce increased anxiety (physiological and subjective measures) compared to a
      baseline condition. There were a number of main effects and interaction effects
      for all three independent variables in terms of the subjective measures of
      anxiety. Both known anxiety triggers and simulation fidelity had a direct
      relationship to anxiety, while field of regard had an inverse relationship.
      Overall, the results demonstrate great potential for VR sport psychology training
      systems; however, further research is needed to determine if training in a VR
      environment can lead to long-term reduction in sport-induced anxiety.

PG  - 538185
LID - 10.1155/2013/538185 [doi]
AB  - Psychotic disorders carry social and economic costs for sufferers and society.
      Recent evidence highlights the risk posed by urban upbringing and social
      deprivation in the genesis of paranoia and psychosis. Evidence based
      psychological interventions are often not offered because of a lack of
      therapists. Virtual reality (VR) environments have been used to treat mental
      health problems. VR may be a way of understanding the aetiological processes in
      psychosis and increasing psychotherapeutic resources for its treatment. We
      developed a high-fidelity virtual reality scenario of an urban street scene to
      test the hypothesis that virtual urban exposure is able to generate paranoia to a
      comparable or greater extent than scenarios using indoor scenes. Participants (n 
      = 32) entered the VR scenario for four minutes, after which time their degree of 
      paranoid ideation was assessed. We demonstrated that the virtual reality scenario
      was able to elicit paranoia in a nonclinical, healthy group and that an urban
      scene was more likely to lead to higher levels of paranoia than a virtual indoor 
      environment. We suggest that this study offers evidence to support the role of
      exposure to factors in the urban environment in the genesis and maintenance of
      psychotic experiences and symptoms. The realistic high-fidelity street scene
      scenario may offer a useful tool for therapists.

TI  - Principal considerations for the contemporary high-fidelity endovascular
      simulator design used in training and evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The simulation and rehearsal of virtual endovascular procedures are
      anticipated to improve the outcomes of actual procedures. Contemporary,
      high-fidelity simulation is based on feedback systems that combine concepts of
      mechanical, electrical, computer, and control systems engineering to reproduce an
      interactive endovascular case. These sophisticated devices also include
      psychometric instruments for objective surgical skill assessment. The goal of
      this report is to identify the design characteristics of commercially available
      simulators for endovascular procedures and to provide a cross-section comparison 
      across all devices to aid in the simulator selection process. METHODS: Data were 
      obtained (1) by a standard questionnaire issued to four simulator companies
      prompting for relevant design details of each model for the expressed purpose of 
      publication, (2) from each manufacturer's respective website including appended
      sales brochures and specification sheets, and (3) by an evaluation of
      peer-reviewed literature. Focus topics include haptic technology, vessel
      segmentation, physiologic feedback, performance feedback, and physical logistics 
      (ie, weight, dimensions, and portability). All data sources were surveyed between
      January 1, 2012, and June 30, 2013. RESULTS: All of the commercially available,
      high-fidelity endovascular simulators use interactive virtual environments with
      preprogrammed physics and physiology models for accurate reproduction of surgical
      reality. The principal differences between devices are the number of access sites
      and haptic devices, the ability to reconstruct patient-specific anatomy for
      preprocedural rehearsal, and the available peripheral training modalities.
      Hardware and software options can also vary within the same device in comparing
      patient-specific with generic cases. CONCLUSIONS: Despite our limited knowledge
      about the potential of high-fidelity simulation within the endovascular world,
      today's currently available simulators successfully provide high-fidelity
      reproductions of the endovascular environment. We have found that all of the
      commercially available devices incorporate the necessary features for a
      high-fidelity experience: (1) haptic technology, (2) vessel reconstruction, (3)
      physiology feedback, and (4) performance feedback. Significant variations in
      design do exist and may influence differences in skill development, evaluation,
      or cost. However, further validation of these differences is still needed and
      would benefit program directors interested in expanding these platforms for
      vascular training and certification as this technology matures.

TI  - Immersive Virtual Reality for Visualization of Abdominal CT.
LID - 10.1117/12.2008050 [doi]
AB  - Immersive virtual environments use a stereoscopic head-mounted display and data
      glove to create high fidelity virtual experiences in which users can interact
      with three-dimensional models and perceive relationships at their true scale.
      This stands in stark contrast to traditional PACS-based infrastructure in which
      images are viewed as stacks of two-dimensional slices, or, at best, disembodied
      renderings. Although there has substantial innovation in immersive virtual
      environments for entertainment and consumer media, these technologies have not
      been widely applied in clinical applications. Here, we consider potential
      applications of immersive virtual environments for ventral hernia patients with
      abdominal computed tomography imaging data. Nearly a half million ventral hernias
      occur in the United States each year, and hernia repair is the most commonly
      performed general surgery operation worldwide. A significant problem in these
      conditions is communicating the urgency, degree of severity, and impact of a
      hernia (and potential repair) on patient quality of life. Hernias are defined by 
      ruptures in the abdominal wall (i.e., the absence of healthy tissues) rather than
      a growth (e.g., cancer); therefore, understanding a hernia necessitates
      understanding the entire abdomen. Our environment allows surgeons and patients to
      view body scans at scale and interact with these virtual models using a data
      glove. This visualization and interaction allows users to perceive the
      relationship between physical structures and medical imaging data. The system
      provides close integration of PACS-based CT data with immersive virtual
      environments and creates opportunities to study and optimize interfaces for
      patient communication, operative planning, and medical education.

TI  - Cadaveric temporal bone dissection: is it obsolete today?
PG  - 63-7
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1351681 [doi]
AB  - Introduction Traditionally, surgical training in otology, is imparted by
      dissecting harvested human cadaveric temporal bones. However, maintenance of a
      cadaveric temporal bone laboratory is expensive and carries risk of exposure to
      infection. In recent times, other modalities of training are gaining ground and
      are likely to eventually replace cadaveric temporal bone dissection altogether.
      Objectives Other alternative methods of training are emerging. New technology
      like simulation and virtual reality as high-fidelity, safer alternatives, are
      making rapid strides as teaching tools. Other options are the use of animal
      temporal bones as teaching tools. The advantages of these are compared. Data
      Synthesis None of these modalities can replicate the innumerable anatomical
      variations which are a characteristic feature of the human temporal bone. A
      novice surgeon not only needs exposure to surgical anatomy and it's variations
      but also needs to develop hand-eye coordination skills to gain expertise.
      Conclusion Deliberate practice on human cadaveric temporal bones only, will
      confer both mastery in anatomy and surgical technique. The human cadaveric
      temporal bone is ideal simulator for training in otology.

TI  - A physics-based algorithm for real-time simulation of electrosurgery procedures
      in minimally invasive surgery.
PG  - 495-504
LID - 10.1002/rcs.1561 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High-frequency electricity is used in the majority of surgical
      interventions. However, modern computer-based training and simulation systems
      rely on physically unrealistic models that fail to capture the interplay of the
      electrical, mechanical and thermal properties of biological tissue. METHODS: We
      present a real-time and physically realistic simulation of electrosurgery by
      modelling the electrical, thermal and mechanical properties as three iteratively 
      solved finite element models. To provide subfinite-element graphical rendering of
      vaporized tissue, a dual-mesh dynamic triangulation algorithm based on isotherms 
      is proposed. The block compressed row storage (BCRS) structure is shown to be
      critical in allowing computationally efficient changes in the tissue topology due
      to vaporization. RESULTS: We have demonstrated our physics-based electrosurgery
      cutting algorithm through various examples. Our matrix manipulation algorithms
      designed for topology changes have shown low computational cost. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      simulator offers substantially greater physical fidelity compared to previous
      simulators that use simple geometry-based heat characterization.

PG  - 1623-4
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2013.1011 [doi]
AB  - Simulation has been widely used to great effect in many high-risk industries and 
      well validated in a number of medical disciplines. Different forms of medical
      simulation exist, from traditional wet laboratories, through immersive scenarios,
      to modern high-fidelity simulation such as virtual reality. What remains
      unestablished is the exact when, where, and how this technology should fit within
      recognized ophthalmic training systems. The International Forum of Ophthalmic
      Simulation is a multinational, multicenter collaborative established to introduce
      and evaluate virtual-reality simulation through a global cloud of networked
      simulators. In this article, we detail the modern evolution of virtual-reality
      simulation in ophthalmology and present the ultimate goal of the profession and
      the International Forum of Ophthalmic Simulation, which is to develop a
      virtual-reality program that augments and accelerates surgical training, thereby 
      improving outcomes for trainees, trainers, and patients.

TI  - Airway management in a bronchoscopic simulator based setting: an observational
      study.
PG  - 125-30
LID - 10.1097/EJA.0b013e328364395a [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several simulation-based possibilities for training flexible optical 
      intubation have been developed, ranging from non-anatomical phantoms to
      high-fidelity virtual reality simulators. These teaching devices might also be
      used to assess the competence of trainees before allowing them to practice on
      patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the validity of airway simulation as an
      assessment tool for the acquisition of the preclinical basic skills in flexible
      optical intubation and to investigate anaesthetists' opinion on airway
      simulation. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: International airway course.
      PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six consultants and residents in anaesthesiology. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: All participants performed one single procedure on each of the 
      three different simulators. Their video-filmed performances were assessed by two 
      independent, blinded experts and their opinions of simulation were surveyed.
      RESULTS: The mean score increased 0.33 points after each attempt (P = 0.021). The
      attitude towards simulation-based training was always more than 4 on a scale from
      1 to 5. Only 25% of the procedures were performed to satisfaction with a
      learning-by-testing effect (P = 0.021). Generalisability coefficient was 0.55,
      and there was no correlation between the number of clinical procedures performed 
      beforehand and test scores (P = 0.93). CONCLUSION: The increase in mean score is 
      a learning effect indicating that simulator training allows for entry of the
      learning curve at a higher level. The anaesthetists in our study agreed
      completely that simulation-based training was useful regardless of the fidelity
      of the simulator. Local, practical issues such as cost and portability should
      decide available simulation modalities in each teaching hospital.

AB  - The use of virtual reality (VR) training tools for medical education could lead
      to improvements in the skills of clinicians while providing economic incentives
      for healthcare institutions. The use of VR tools can also mitigate some of the
      drawbacks currently associated with providing medical training in a traditional
      clinical environment such as scheduling conflicts and the need for specialized
      equipment (e.g., high-fidelity manikins). This paper presents the details of the 
      framework and the development methodology associated with a VR-based training
      simulator for advanced cardiac life support, a time critical, team-based medical 
      scenario. In addition, we also report the key findings of a usability study
      conducted to assess the efficacy of various features of this VR simulator through
      a postuse questionnaire administered to various care providers. The usability
      questionnaires were completed by two groups that used two different versions of
      the VR simulator. One version consisted of the VR trainer with it all its
      features and a minified version with certain immersive features disabled. We
      found an increase in usability scores from the minified group to the full VR
      group.

PG  - 78-84
LID - 10.1038/eye.2013.211 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Training within a proficiency-based virtual reality (VR) curriculum may 
      reduce errors during real surgical procedures. This study used a scientific
      methodology to develop a VR training curriculum for phacoemulsification surgery
      (PS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten novice-(n) (performed <10 cataract operations),
      10 intermediate-(i) (50-200), and 10 experienced-(e) (>500) surgeons were
      recruited. Construct validity was defined as the ability to differentiate between
      the three levels of experience, based on the simulator-derived metrics for two
      abstract modules (four tasks) and three procedural modules (five tasks) on a
      high-fidelity VR simulator. Proficiency measures were based on the performance of
      experienced surgeons. RESULTS: Abstract modules demonstrated a 'ceiling effect'
      with construct validity established between groups (n) and (i) but not between
      groups (i) and (e)-Forceps 1 (46, 87, and 95; P<0.001). Increasing difficulty of 
      task showed significantly reduced performance in (n) but minimal difference for
      (i) and (e)-Anti-tremor 4 (0, 51, and 59; P<0.001), Forceps 4 (11, 73, and 94;
      P<0.001). Procedural modules were found to be construct valid between groups (n) 
      and (i) and between groups (i) and (e)-Lens-cracking (0, 22, and 51; P<0.05) and 
      Phaco-quadrants (16, 53, and 87; P<0.05). This was also the case with
      Capsulorhexis (0, 19, and 63; P<0.05) with the performance decreasing in the (n) 
      and (i) group but improving in the (e) group (0, 55, and 73; P<0.05) and (0, 48, 
      and 76; P<0.05) as task difficulty increased. CONCLUSION:
      Experienced/intermediate benchmark skill levels are defined allowing the
      development of a proficiency-based VR training curriculum for PS for novices
      using a structured scientific methodology.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The mastery of manual skills that are indispensable for the 
      performance of surgical tasks is a competence specific to surgery. One way of
      facilitating this acquisition is to move the training out of the operating room
      and all of its restrictions. Surgical training out of the operating room, also
      called simulation, has spread widely in the past decade, especially in
      laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review assesses
      the role of virtual reality (VR) simulators in laparoscopic surgery and their
      actual impact on technical skills. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There is a wealth of 
      simulators, ranging from low- to high-fidelity simulators incorporating haptic
      feedback. They comprise basic tasks, procedural modules, and full procedures.
      Virtual reality simulators have shown acceptable fidelity and validity evidence. 
      Moreover, training out of the operating room on virtual reality simulators has
      demonstrated its positive impact on basic skills during real laparoscopic
      procedures in patients. The benefit of virtual reality over simple video trainers
      remains unclear for teaching basic skills. However, virtual reality simulators
      provide automatic feedback that permitted to design structured competency-based
      curricula and allow deliberate practice. Finally, advanced procedures and
      patient-specific models have been designed on virtual reality simulators, and
      further investigations are still awaited to appraise their educational value.

TI  - The development of a virtual reality training programme for ophthalmology:
      repeatability and reproducibility (part of the International Forum for Ophthalmic
      Simulation Studies).
PG  - 1269-74
LID - 10.1038/eye.2013.166 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the variability of performance among novice ophthalmic
      trainees in a range of repeated tasks using the Eyesi virtual reality (VR)
      simulator. METHODS: Eighteen subjects undertook three attempts of five cataract
      specific and generic three-dimensional tasks: continuous curvilinear
      capsulorhexis, cracking and chopping, cataract navigation, bimanual cataract
      training, anti-tremor. Scores for each attempt were out of a maximum of 100
      points. A non-parametric test was used to analyse the data, where a P-value of
      <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Highly significant
      differences were found between the scores achieved in the first attempt and that 
      during the second (P<0.0001) and third (P<0.0001) but not between the second and 
      third attempt (P=0.65). There was no significant variability in the overall score
      between the users (P=0.1104) or in the difference between their highest and
      lowest score (P=0.3878). Highly significant differences between tasks were shown 
      both in the overall score (P=0.0001) and in the difference between highest and
      lowest score (P=0.003). CONCLUSION: This study, which is the first to quantify
      reproducibility of performance in entry level trainees using a VR tool,
      demonstrated significant intra-novice variability. The cohort of subjects
      performed equally overall in the range of tasks (no inter-novice variability) but
      each showed that performance varies significantly with the complexity of the task
      when using this high-fidelity instrument.

TI  - Computer-aided design and manufacturing in craniosynostosis surgery.
PG  - 1100-5
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0b013e31828b7021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Considerable operative time is expended during the planning, shaping,
      and reconfiguring of the cranial vault in the pursuit of symmetry during open
      craniosynostosis surgery. Computer-aided design and manufacturing has recently
      been implemented in orthognathic surgery and complex craniomaxillofacial
      reconstruction as a means of optimizing operative accuracy and efficiency. In
      this report, we highlight our growing experience with this promising modality for
      the preoperative planning and intraoperative execution of cranial vault
      remodeling in patients with both simple and complex forms of craniosynostosis.
      METHODS: Computer-assisted surgical planning begins with acquisition of
      high-resolution computed tomography scans of the craniofacial skeleton. An
      Internet-based teleconference is then held between the craniofacial and
      biomedical engineering teams and provides a forum for virtual manipulation of the
      patient's preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography with real-time
      changes and feedback. Through virtual surgical planning, osteotomies are designed
      and calvarial bones reconfigured to achieve the desired cranial vault appearance.
      Cutting and positioning guides are manufactured to transform the virtual plan
      into a reality. RESULTS: From February to March 2012, 4 children (aged 9 months
      to 6 years) with craniosynostosis underwent computer-assisted simulation and
      surgery. Diagnoses included metopic, unicoronal (n = 2), and multisutural
      synostoses (sagittal and left unicoronal). Open craniofacial repairs were
      performed as virtually planned, including front o-orbital remodeling,
      fronto-orbital advancement, and anterior two-thirds calvarial remodeling,
      respectively. Cutting and final positioning guides demonstrated excellent
      fidelity and ease of use. CONCLUSIONS: Computer-aided design and manufacturing
      may offer a platform for optimizing operative efficiency, precision, and accuracy
      in craniosynostosis surgery, while accelerating the learning curve for future
      trainees.

TI  - Modulation of visually evoked postural responses by contextual visual, haptic and
      auditory information: a 'virtual reality check'.
PG  - e67651
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0067651 [doi]
AB  - Externally generated visual motion signals can cause the illusion of self-motion 
      in space (vection) and corresponding visually evoked postural responses (VEPR).
      These VEPRs are not simple responses to optokinetic stimulation, but are
      modulated by the configuration of the environment. The aim of this paper is to
      explore what factors modulate VEPRs in a high quality virtual reality (VR)
      environment where real and virtual foreground objects served as static visual,
      auditory and haptic reference points. Data from four experiments on visually
      evoked postural responses show that: 1) visually evoked postural sway in the
      lateral direction is modulated by the presence of static anchor points that can
      be haptic, visual and auditory reference signals; 2) real objects and their
      matching virtual reality representations as visual anchors have different effects
      on postural sway; 3) visual motion in the anterior-posterior plane induces robust
      postural responses that are not modulated by the presence of reference signals or
      the reality of objects that can serve as visual anchors in the scene. We conclude
      that automatic postural responses for laterally moving visual stimuli are
      strongly influenced by the configuration and interpretation of the environment
      and draw on multisensory representations. Different postural responses were
      observed for real and virtual visual reference objects. On the basis that
      automatic visually evoked postural responses in high fidelity virtual
      environments should mimic those seen in real situations we propose to use the
      observed effect as a robust objective test for presence and fidelity in VR.

      a 3D virtual learning environment for youth with high functioning autism.
PG  - 417-30
LID - 10.1007/s10803-013-1881-0 [doi]
AB  - One consistent area of need for students with autism spectrum disorders is in the
      area of social competence. However, the increasing need to provide qualified
      teachers to deliver evidence-based practices in areas like social competence
      leave schools, such as those found in rural areas, in need of support. Distance
      education and in particular, 3D Virtual Learning, holds great promise for
      supporting schools and youth to gain social competence through knowledge and
      social practice in context. iSocial, a distance education, 3D virtual learning
      environment implemented the 31-lesson social competence intervention for
      adolescents across three small cohorts totaling 11 students over a period of 4
      months. Results demonstrated that the social competence curriculum was delivered 
      with fidelity in the 3D virtual learning environment. Moreover, learning outcomes
      suggest that the iSocial approach shows promise for social competence benefits
      for youth.

TI  - The German VR Simulation Realism Scale--psychometric construction for virtual
      reality applications with virtual humans.
PG  - 33-7
AB  - Virtual training applications with high levels of immersion or fidelity (for
      example for social phobia treatment) produce high levels of presence and
      therefore belong to the most successful Virtual Reality developments. Whereas
      display and interaction fidelity (as sub-dimensions of immersion) and their
      influence on presence are well researched, realism of the displayed simulation
      depends on the specific application and is therefore difficult to measure. We
      propose to measure simulation realism by using a self-report questionnaire. The
      German VR Simulation Realism Scale for VR training applications was developed
      based on a translation of scene realism items from the Witmer-Singer-Presence
      Questionnaire. Items for realism of virtual humans (for example for social phobia
      training applications) were supplemented. A sample of N = 151 students rated
      simulation realism of a Fear of Public Speaking application. Four factors were
      derived by item- and principle component analysis (Varimax rotation),
      representing Scene Realism, Audience Behavior, Audience Appearance and Sound
      Realism. The scale developed can be used as a starting point for future research 
      and measurement of simulation realism for applications including virtual humans.

TI  - Comparing the cost-effectiveness of simulation modalities: a case study of
      peripheral intravenous catheterization training.
PG  - 219-32
LID - 10.1007/s10459-013-9464-6 [doi]
AB  - While the ultimate goal of simulation training is to enhance learning,
      cost-effectiveness is a critical factor. Research that compares simulation
      training in terms of educational- and cost-effectiveness will lead to
      better-informed curricular decisions. Using previously published data we
      conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of three simulation-based programs.
      Medical students (n = 15 per group) practiced in one of three 2-h intravenous
      catheterization skills training programs: low-fidelity (virtual reality),
      high-fidelity (mannequin), or progressive (consisting of virtual reality, task
      trainer, and mannequin simulator). One week later, all performed a transfer test 
      on a hybrid simulation (standardized patient with a task trainer). We used a net 
      benefit regression model to identify the most cost-effective training program via
      paired comparisons. We also created a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve to
      visually represent the probability that one program is more cost-effective when
      compared to its comparator at various 'willingness-to-pay' values. We conducted
      separate analyses for implementation and total costs. The results showed that the
      progressive program had the highest total cost (p < 0.001) whereas the
      high-fidelity program had the highest implementation cost (p < 0.001). While the 
      most cost-effective program depended on the decision makers' willingness-to-pay
      value, the progressive training program was generally most educationally- and
      cost-effective. Our analyses suggest that a progressive program that
      strategically combines simulation modalities provides a cost-effective solution. 
      More generally, we have introduced how a cost-effectiveness analysis may be
      applied to simulation training; a method that medical educators may use to
      investment decisions (e.g., purchasing cost-effective and educationally sound
      simulators).

TI  - A systematic review of phacoemulsification cataract surgery in virtual reality
      simulators.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - The aim of this study was to review the capability of virtual reality simulators 
      in the application of phacoemulsification cataract surgery training. Our review
      included the scientific publications on cataract surgery simulators that had been
      developed by different groups of researchers along with commercialized surgical
      training products, such as EYESI(R) and PhacoVision(R). The review covers the
      simulation of the main cataract surgery procedures, i.e., corneal incision,
      capsulorrhexis, phacosculpting, and intraocular lens implantation in various
      virtual reality surgery simulators. Haptics realism and visual realism of the
      procedures are the main elements in imitating the actual surgical environment.
      The involvement of ophthalmology in research on virtual reality since the early
      1990s has made a great impact on the development of surgical simulators. Most of 
      the latest cataract surgery training systems are able to offer high fidelity in
      visual feedback and haptics feedback, but visual realism, such as the rotational 
      movements of an eyeball with response to the force applied by surgical
      instruments, is still lacking in some of them. The assessment of the surgical
      tasks carried out on the simulators showed a significant difference in the
      performance before and after the training.

TI  - Application of the "see one, do one, teach one" concept in surgical training.
PG  - 1194-201
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0b013e318287a0b3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The traditional method of teaching in surgery is known as "see one,
      do one, teach one." However, many have argued that this method is no longer
      applicable, mainly because of concerns for patient safety. The purpose of this
      article is to show that the basis of the traditional teaching method is still
      valid in surgical training if it is combined with various adult learning
      principles. METHODS: The authors reviewed literature regarding the history of the
      formation of the surgical residency program, adult learning principles,
      mentoring, and medical simulation. The authors provide examples for how these
      learning techniques can be incorporated into a surgical resident training
      program. RESULTS: The surgical residency program created by Dr. William Halsted
      remained virtually unchanged until recently with reductions in resident work
      hours and changes to a competency-based training system. Such changes have
      reduced the teaching time between attending physicians and residents. Learning
      principles such as experience, observation, thinking, and action and deliberate
      practice can be used to train residents. Mentoring is also an important aspect in
      teaching surgical technique. The authors review the different types of
      simulators-standardized patients, virtual reality applications, and high-fidelity
      mannequin simulators-and the advantages and disadvantages of using them.
      CONCLUSIONS: The traditional teaching method of "see one, do one, teach one" in
      surgical residency programs is simple but still applicable. It needs to evolve
      with current changes in the medical system to adequately train surgical residents
      and also provide patients with safe, evidence-based care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Validation of a virtual reality (VR) simulator for the training and
      assessment of laparoscopic tubal surgery and mapping of cognitive load. STUDY
      DESIGN: Prospective cohort study conducted at the Imperial College Virtual
      Reality Surgical Skills laboratory amongst 25 trainees and nine senior
      gynaecologists. Participants performed two sessions of salpingectomy and
      salpingotomy procedures on a VR simulator to assess construct validity. Nine
      novices performed ten such sessions to enable assessment of the learning curve.
      The relationship between cognitive load and the dexterity parameters was
      assessed. Simulator fidelity was reported by experienced and intermediate level
      gynaecologists. Statistical analyses utilised non-parametric tests,
      Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Learning curves were assessed using the
      Friedman test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. Relationship between dexterity
      metrics and cognitive load was performed using Spearman's rank order correlation.
      RESULTS: Salpingectomy demonstrated construct validity for time taken by
      experienced, intermediate and novice gynaecologists (median 170 vs. 191 vs. 313s 
      (P=0.003) respectively) and movements (median 200 vs. 267 vs. 376s, P=0.045).
      Salpingotomy demonstrated construct validity for time taken (median 183 vs. 191
      vs. 306s, P=<0.001) and movements (median 210 vs. 233 vs. 328s, P=0.005).
      Learning curve analysis for salpingectomy displayed a plateau for time taken
      after the eighth session, and the fourth session for movements. Salpingotomy
      displayed a plateau after the eighth session for both time taken and movements.
      Cognitive load correlated significantly with dexterity parameters. The fidelity
      scores were not significantly different between the two procedures (P=0.619).
      CONCLUSION: The LAP Mentor VR laparoscopic simulator is a valid and effective
      tool for training novice surgeons in ectopic pregnancy surgery. Reduction in
      cognitive load significantly correlates with the learning curves.

TI  - What skills should simulation training in arthroscopy teach residents? A focus on
      resident input.
PG  - 945-53
LID - 10.1007/s11548-013-0833-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Our purpose was to identify what surgical skills trainees consider
      important to possess before performing in the operating room and the components
      of an optimal simulator. METHODS: An online survey composed of 35 questions was
      completed by 67 orthopedic residents from across Canada. The questions examined
      the opinions of residents for their perspective on what constitutes an optimal
      design of an arthroscopic simulator. RESULTS: The average year of residency of
      the respondents was 3.2, and the average number of arthroscopies assisted on was 
      66.1 with a range of 0-300. Identification of structures and navigation of the
      arthroscope were ranked highly in terms of importance for trainee surgeons to
      possess before performing in the operating room. Higher fidelity simulation
      models such as cadaveric specimens or the use of synthetic knees were preferred
      over lower fidelity simulation models such as virtual reality simulators or bench
      top models. CONCLUSION: The information from trainees can be used in the
      development of a simulator for medical education as well as program and
      curriculum design. The report also highlights the importance of the pre-RCT
      phases leading to the development of the most effective simulation programs.

PG  - 547-56
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2013.41 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the validity of Mixed Reality (MR) Simulation by
      conducting an experiment studying the effects of the visual realism of the
      simulated environment on various search tasks in Augmented Reality (AR). MR
      Simulation is a practical approach to conducting controlled and repeatable user
      experiments in MR, including AR. This approach uses a high-fidelity Virtual
      Reality (VR) display system to simulate a wide range of equal or lower fidelity
      displays from the MR continuum, for the express purpose of conducting user
      experiments. For the experiment, we created three virtual models of a real-world 
      location, each with a different perceived level of visual realism. We designed
      and executed an AR experiment using the real-world location and repeated the
      experiment within VR using the three virtual models we created. The experiment
      looked into how fast users could search for both physical and virtual information
      that was present in the scene. Our experiment demonstrates the usefulness of MR
      Simulation and provides early evidence for the validity of MR Simulation with
      respect to AR search tasks performed in immersive VR.

TI  - Validation of the MR simulation approach for evaluating the effects of immersion 
      on visual analysis of volume data.
PG  - 529-38
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2013.43 [doi]
AB  - In our research agenda to study the effects of immersion (level of fidelity) on
      various tasks in virtual reality (VR) systems, we have found that the most
      generalizable findings come not from direct comparisons of different
      technologies, but from controlled simulations of those technologies. We call this
      the mixed reality (MR) simulation approach. However, the validity of MR
      simulation, especially when different simulator platforms are used, can be
      questioned. In this paper, we report the results of an experiment examining the
      effects of field of regard (FOR) and head tracking on the analysis of volume
      visualized micro-CT datasets, and compare them with those from a previous study. 
      The original study used a CAVE-like display as the MR simulator platform, while
      the present study used a high-end head-mounted display (HMD). Out of the 24
      combinations of system characteristics and tasks tested on the two platforms, we 
      found that the results produced by the two different MR simulators were similar
      in 20 cases. However, only one of the significant effects found in the original
      experiment for quantitative tasks was reproduced in the present study. Our
      observations provide evidence both for and against the validity of MR simulation,
      and give insight into the differences caused by different MR simulator platforms.
      The present experiment also examined new conditions not present in the original
      study, and produced new significant results, which confirm and extend previous
      existing knowledge on the effects of FOR and head tracking. We provide design
      guidelines for choosing display systems that can improve the effectiveness of
      volume visualization applications.

      cynophobia.
PG  - 145-52
LID - 10.1089/cyber.2012.1568 [doi]
AB  - Traditionally, virtual reality (VR) exposure-based treatment concentrates
      primarily on the presentation of a high-fidelity visual experience. However,
      adequately combining the visual and the auditory experience provides a powerful
      tool to enhance sensory processing and modulate attention. We present the design 
      and usability testing of an auditory-visual interactive environment for
      investigating VR exposure-based treatment for cynophobia. The specificity of our 
      application involves 3D sound, allowing the presentation and spatial
      manipulations of a fearful stimulus in the auditory modality and in the visual
      modality. We conducted an evaluation test with 10 participants who fear dogs to
      assess the capacity of our auditory-visual virtual environment (VE) to generate
      fear reactions. The specific perceptual characteristics of the dog model that
      were implemented in the VE were highly arousing, suggesting that VR is a
      promising tool to treat cynophobia.

TI  - The effect of haptic degrees of freedom on task performance in virtual surgical
      environments.
PG  - 129-35
AB  - Force and touch feedback, or haptics, can play a significant role in the realism 
      of virtual reality surgical simulation. While it is accepted that simulators
      providing haptic feedback often outperform those that do not, little is known
      about the degree of haptic fidelity required to achieve simulation objectives.
      This article evaluates the effect that employing haptic rendering with different 
      degrees of freedom (DOF) has on task performance in a virtual environment.
      Results show that 6-DOF haptic rendering significantly improves task performance 
      over 3-DOF haptic rendering, even if computed torques are not displayed to the
      user. No significant difference could be observed between under-actuated (force
      only) and fully-actuated 6-DOF feedback in two surgically-motivated tasks.

TI  - Objective performance measures using motion sensors on an endoscopic tool for
      evaluating skills in natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES).
PG  - 78-84
AB  - Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery is an emerging procedure. High
      fidelity virtual reality-based simulators allow development of new surgical
      procedures and tools and train medical personnel without risk to human patients. 
      As part of a project funded by the National Institutes of Health, we are
      developing a Virtual Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery Trainer (VTEST TM) for this 
      purpose. In this work, objective performance measures derived from motion
      tracking sensors attached to an endoscope was tested for the transgastric NOTES
      appendectomy procedure performed with ex-vivo pig organs using the EASIE-R(TM)
      trainer box. Results from our study shows that both completion time and economy
      of motion parameters were able to differentiate between expert and novice NOTES
      surgeons with p value of 0.039 and 0.02 respectively. Jerk computed on sensor 2
      data also showed significant results (p = 0.02). We plan to incorporate these
      objective performance measures in VTEST(TM).

TI  - Needs analysis for developing a virtual-reality NOTES simulator.
PG  - 1607-16
LID - 10.1007/s00464-012-2637-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND STUDY AIM: Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery
      (NOTES) is an emerging surgical technique that requires a cautious adoption
      approach to ensure patient safety. High-fidelity virtual-reality-based simulators
      allow development of new surgical procedures and tools and train medical
      personnel without risk to human patients. As part of a project funded by the
      National Institutes of Health, we are developing the virtual transluminal
      endoscopic surgery trainer (VTEST) for this purpose. The objective of this study 
      is to conduct a structured needs analysis to identify the design parameters for
      such a virtual-reality-based simulator for NOTES. METHODS: A 30-point
      questionnaire was distributed at the 2011 National Orifice Surgery Consortium for
      Assessment and Research meeting to obtain responses from experts. Ordinal
      logistic regression and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for analysis.
      RESULTS: A total of 22 NOTES experts participated in the study. Cholecystectomy
      (CE, 68 %) followed by appendectomy (AE, 63 %) (CE vs AE, p = 0.0521) was
      selected as the first choice for simulation. Flexible (FL, 47 %) and hybrid (HY, 
      47 %) approaches were equally favorable compared with rigid (RI, 6 %) with p <
      0.001 for both FL versus RI and HY versus RI. The transvaginal approach was
      preferred 3 to 1 to the transgastric. Most participants preferred two-channel
      (2C) scopes (65 %) compared with single (1C) or three (3C) or more channels with 
      p < 0.001 for both 2C versus 1C and 2C versus 3C. The importance of force
      feedback and the utility of a virtual NOTES simulator in training and testing new
      tools for NOTES were rated very high by the participants. CONCLUSION: Our study
      reinforces the importance of developing a virtual NOTES simulator and clearly
      presents expert preferences. The results of this analysis will direct our initial
      development of the VTEST platform.

AB  - The transfusion of blood and blood products is a complex, multi-professional task
      which is liable to errors from donor to recipient. Simulation is a new training
      tool in medicine which may result with an improvement for safety and quality of
      care without any risk for the patient. Different simulators are available: haptic
      system and low fidelity mannequin for technical skills, software, full scale
      intermediate to high fidelity mannequin, actors and virtual reality. For
      haemovigilance training, actors and intermediate to high fidelity mannequins
      could be used to simulate complex professional situations with identity mistake
      and crisis management. The environment of full scale simulation is expensive and 
      need technical and pedagogic skills.

TI  - Real-time mandibular angle reduction surgical simulation with haptic rendering.
PG  - 1105-14
LID - 10.1109/TITB.2012.2218114 [doi]
AB  - Mandibular angle reduction is a popular and efficient procedure widely used to
      alter the facial contour. The primary surgical instruments, the reciprocating saw
      and the round burr, employed in the surgery have a common feature: operating at a
      high-speed. Generally, inexperienced surgeons need a long-time practice to learn 
      how to minimize the risks caused by the uncontrolled contacts and cutting motions
      in manipulation of instruments with high-speed reciprocation or rotation. A
      virtual reality-based surgical simulator for the mandibular angle reduction was
      designed and implemented on a CUDA-based platform in this paper. High-fidelity
      visual and haptic feedbacks are provided to enhance the perception in a realistic
      virtual surgical environment. The impulse-based haptic models were employed to
      simulate the contact forces and torques on the instruments. It provides
      convincing haptic sensation for surgeons to control the instruments under
      different reciprocation or rotation velocities. The real-time methods for bone
      removal and reconstruction during surgical procedures have been proposed to
      support realistic visual feedbacks. The simulated contact forces were verified by
      comparing against the actual force data measured through the constructed
      mechanical platform. An empirical study based on the patient-specific data was
      conducted to evaluate the ability of the proposed system in training surgeons
      with various experiences. The results confirm the validity of our simulator.

TI  - Objective fidelity evaluation in multisensory virtual environments: auditory cue 
      fidelity in flight simulation.
PG  - e44381
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0044381 [doi]
AB  - We argue that objective fidelity evaluation of virtual environments, such as
      flight simulation, should be human-performance-centred and task-specific rather
      than measure the match between simulation and physical reality. We show how
      principled experimental paradigms and behavioural models to quantify human
      performance in simulated environments that have emerged from research in
      multisensory perception provide a framework for the objective evaluation of the
      contribution of individual cues to human performance measures of fidelity. We
      present three examples in a flight simulation environment as a case study:
      Experiment 1: Detection and categorisation of auditory and kinematic motion cues;
      Experiment 2: Performance evaluation in a target-tracking task; Experiment 3:
      Transferrable learning of auditory motion cues. We show how the contribution of
      individual cues to human performance can be robustly evaluated for each task and 
      that the contribution is highly task dependent. The same auditory cues that can
      be discriminated and are optimally integrated in experiment 1, do not contribute 
      to target-tracking performance in an in-flight refuelling simulation without
      training, experiment 2. In experiment 3, however, we demonstrate that the
      auditory cue leads to significant, transferrable, performance improvements with
      training. We conclude that objective fidelity evaluation requires a task-specific
      analysis of the contribution of individual cues.

TI  - Auditory-visual integration of emotional signals in a virtual environment for
      cynophobia.
PG  - 238-42
AB  - Cynophobia (dog phobia) has both visual and auditory relevant components. In
      order to investigate the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) exposure-based
      treatment for cynophobia, we studied the efficiency of auditory-visual
      environments in generating presence and emotion. We conducted an evaluation test 
      with healthy participants sensitive to cynophobia in order to assess the capacity
      of auditory-visual virtual environments (VE) to generate fear reactions. Our
      application involves both high fidelity visual stimulation displayed in an
      immersive space and 3D sound. This specificity enables us to present and
      spatially manipulate fearful stimuli in the auditory modality, the visual
      modality and both. Our specific presentation of animated dog stimuli creates an
      environment that is highly arousing, suggesting that VR is a promising tool for
      cynophobia treatment and that manipulating auditory-visual integration might
      provide a way to modulate affect.

TI  - Studying the effects of stereo, head tracking, and field of regard on a
      small-scale spatial judgment task.
PG  - 886-96
AB  - Spatial judgments are important for many real-world tasks in engineering and
      scientific visualization. While existing research provides evidence that higher
      levels of display and interaction fidelity in virtual reality systems offer
      advantages for spatial understanding, few investigations have focused on
      small-scale spatial judgments or employed experimental tasks similar to those
      used in real-world applications. After an earlier study that considered a broad
      analysis of various spatial understanding tasks, we present the results of a
      follow-up study focusing on small-scale spatial judgments. In this research, we
      independently controlled field of regard, stereoscopy, and head-tracked rendering
      to study their effects on the performance of a task involving precise spatial
      inspections of complex 3D structures. Measuring time and errors, we asked
      participants to distinguish between structural gaps and intersections between
      components of 3D models designed to be similar to real underground cave systems. 
      The overall results suggest that the addition of the higher fidelity system
      features support performance improvements in making small-scale spatial
      judgments. Through analyses of the effects of individual system components, the
      experiment shows that participants made significantly fewer errors with either an
      increased field of regard or with the addition of head-tracked rendering. The
      results also indicate that participants performed significantly faster when the
      system provided the combination of stereo and head-tracked rendering.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the face and content validity of a novel, full physics, full
      procedural, virtual reality simulation housed in a hybrid procedure suite.
      METHODS AND MATERIALS: After completing 60 minutes of hands-on training in
      uterine artery embolization and coronary angioplasty, 24 radiologists and 18
      cardiologists with mean 10 years of endovascular experience assessed the
      functionality of a comprehensive hybrid procedure suite simulation (Orcamp;
      Orzone, Gothenburg, Sweden). RESULTS: C-arm and operating table functionality and
      realism were reliably (alpha = 0.0.89-0.92) rated highly (80/100). Performance
      realism of the catheter, guide wire, fluoroscopy image, electrocardiogram, and
      vital signs readout also reliably and statistically significantly predicted
      subjects' overall positive assessment (mean = 87/100) of the simulation
      experience in a multiple regression model (alpha = .83; r = 0.85 and r(2) = 0.67;
      P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study reports a quantitative evaluation of a
      comprehensive simulation of an authentic procedure suite for image-guided
      intravascular procedures. This new facility affords the opportunity for trainers 
      to provide higher fidelity training of operative technical, procedural, and
      management skills in the realistic context of a complete procedure suite with all
      its complexities and potential distractions.

TI  - Call-associated acute fatigue in surgical residents--subjective perception or
      objective fact? A cross-sectional observational study to examine the influence of
      fatigue on surgical performance.
PG  - 2276-87
LID - 10.1007/s00268-012-1699-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of acute partial sleep deprivation on surgical proficiency
      is still controversially discussed. The present study correlated physiological
      parameters of fatigue with objective technical and cognitive skills, as well as
      subjective sleepiness of surgical residents. The aim of the study was to assess
      the effect of acute partial sleep deprivation on surgical performance. METHODS:
      Thirty-eight surgeons were interviewed on three consecutive mornings: prior to a 
      24 h call, post-call, and after 24 h of rest. Reported hours of sleep were
      recorded. Subjective alertness was assessed with the standardized
      Stanford-Sleepiness-Scale (SSS). Saliva cortisol concentrations and pupillary
      activity were measured by standardized ELISA and pupillography. The virtual
      reality (VR)-simulator LapSim was used to assess technical skills through
      low-fidelity VR-tasks ("cutting," "clip applying") and cognitive skills through
      high-fidelity VR-tasks ("intracorporeal suturing," "VR-cholecystectomy").
      Objective alertness was measured by the standardized d2-Paper-Pencil Test.
      RESULTS: Recorded hours of sleep (p = 0.001) and subjective alertness (SSS)
      decreased (p = 0.001) significantly post-call. None of the three factors
      studied-saliva cortisol concentration (p = 0.313), pupillary activity (p =
      0.998), or VR-performance of low-fidelity VR-tasks-differed significantly between
      assessments. Surprisingly, VR-performance of high-fidelity VR-tasks (error-score 
      p = 0.044, time to complete task p = 0.0001, economy of instrument motion p =
      0.0001) and objective alertness (d2-Paper-Pencil Test p = 0.027) significantly
      improved in the post-call setting. CONCLUSIONS: Acute call-associated fatigue
      seems to be a predominantly subjective perception. Physiological factors seem to 
      outbalance an anticipated fatigue-associated impairment of technical performances
      within low-fidelity VR-tasks. In surgical residents, acute partial sleep
      deprivation seems to have a positive short-term effect on cognitive skills,
      leading to enhanced technical performance and increased objective alertness
      within complex tasks.

TI  - Virtual reality simulation training for health professions trainees in
      gastrointestinal endoscopy.
PG  - CD008237
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD008237.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditionally, training in gastrointestinal endoscopy has been based 
      upon an apprenticeship model, with novice endoscopists learning basic skills
      under the supervision of experienced preceptors in the clinical setting. Over the
      last two decades, however, the growing awareness of the need for patient safety
      has brought the issue of simulation-based training to the forefront. While the
      use of simulation-based training may have important educational and societal
      advantages, the effectiveness of virtual reality gastrointestinal endoscopy
      simulators has yet to be clearly demonstrated. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether
      virtual reality simulation training can supplement and/or replace early
      conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) in diagnostic
      oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and/or sigmoidoscopy for health
      professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. SEARCH
      METHODS: Health professions, educational and computer databases were searched
      until November 2011 including The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Biosis Previews, CINAHL, Allied and
      Complementary Medicine Database, ERIC, Education Full Text, CBCA Education,
      Career and Technical Education @ Scholars Portal, Education Abstracts @ Scholars 
      Portal, Expanded Academic ASAP @ Scholars Portal, ACM Digital Library, IEEE
      Xplore, Abstracts in New Technologies and Engineering and Computer & Information 
      Systems Abstracts. The grey literature until November 2011 was also searched.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised clinical trials comparing
      virtual reality endoscopy (oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and
      sigmoidoscopy) simulation training versus any other method of endoscopy training 
      including conventional patient-based training, in-job training, training using
      another form of endoscopy simulation (e.g. low-fidelity simulator), or no
      training (however defined by authors) were included. Trials comparing one method 
      of virtual reality training versus another method of virtual reality training
      (e.g. comparison of two different virtual reality simulators) were also included.
      Only trials measuring outcomes on humans in the clinical setting (as opposed to
      animals or simulators) were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors
      (CMS, MES) independently assessed the eligibility and methodological quality of
      trials, and extracted data on the trial characteristics and outcomes. Due to
      significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity it was not possible to pool
      study data in order to perform a meta-analysis. Where data were available for
      each continuous outcome we calculated standardized mean difference with 95%
      confidence intervals based on intention-to-treat analysis. Where data were
      available for dichotomous outcomes we calculated relative risk with 95%
      confidence intervals based on intention-to-treat-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen
      trials, with 278 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Four trials compared
      simulation-based training with conventional patient-based endoscopy training
      (apprenticeship model) whereas nine trials compared simulation-based training
      with no training. Only three trials were at low risk of bias. Simulation-based
      training, as compared with no training, generally appears to provide participants
      with some advantage over their untrained peers as measured by composite score of 
      competency, independent procedure completion, performance time, independent
      insertion depth, overall rating of performance or competency error rate and
      mucosal visualization. Alternatively, there was no conclusive evidence that
      simulation-based training was superior to conventional patient-based training,
      although data were limited. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic 
      review indicate that virtual reality endoscopy training can be used to
      effectively supplement early conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship
      model) in diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and/or
      sigmoidoscopy for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic
      experience. However, there remains insufficient evidence to advise for or against
      the use of virtual reality simulation-based training as a replacement for early
      conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) for health professions
      trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. There is a great need
      for the development of a reliable and valid measure of endoscopic performance
      prior to the completion of further randomised clinical trials with high
      methodological quality.

TI  - The development of a virtual reality training curriculum for colonoscopy.
PG  - 188-92
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0b013e31825b6e9c [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The development of a structured virtual reality (VR) training
      curriculum for colonoscopy using high-fidelity simulation. BACKGROUND:
      Colonoscopy requires detailed knowledge and technical skill. Changes to working
      practices in recent times have reduced the availability of traditional training
      opportunities. Much might, therefore, be achieved by applying novel technologies 
      such as VR simulation to colonoscopy. Scientifically developed device-specific
      curricula aim to maximize the yield of laboratory-based training by focusing on
      validated modules and linking progression to the attainment of benchmarked
      proficiency criteria. METHODS: Fifty participants comprised of 30 novices (<10
      colonoscopies), 10 intermediates (100 to 500 colonoscopies), and 10 experienced
      (>500 colonoscopies) colonoscopists were recruited to participate. Surrogates of 
      proficiency, such as number of procedures undertaken, determined prospective
      allocation to 1 of 3 groups (novice, intermediate, and experienced). Construct
      validity and learning value (comparison between groups and within groups
      respectively) for each task and metric on the chosen simulator model determined
      suitability for inclusion in the curriculum. RESULTS: Eight tasks in possession
      of construct validity and significant learning curves were included in the
      curriculum: 3 abstract tasks, 4 part-procedural tasks, and 1 procedural task. The
      whole-procedure task was valid for 11 metrics including the following: "time
      taken to complete the task" (1238, 343, and 293 s; P < 0.001) and "insertion
      length with embedded tip" (23.8, 3.6, and 4.9 cm; P = 0.005). Learning curves
      consistently plateaued at or beyond the ninth attempt. Valid metrics were used to
      define benchmarks, derived from the performance of the experienced cohort, for
      each included task. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive, stratified, benchmarked,
      whole-procedure curriculum has been developed for a modern high-fidelity VR
      colonoscopy simulator.

TI  - Preliminarily measurement and analysis of sawing forces in fresh cadaver mandible
      using reciprocating saw for reality-based haptic feedback.
PG  - 925-9
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0b013e318250556e [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to preliminarily measure and analyze the
      cutting forces in fresh Chinese cadaver mandible using a clinically widely used
      reciprocating saw for reality-based haptic feedback. METHODS: Eight mandibles
      were taken from fresh Chinese cadavers, 4 females and 4 males, aged between 59
      and 95 years. A set of sawing experiments, using a surgery Stryker
      micro-reciprocating saw and Kistler piezoelectric dynamometer, was carried out by
      a CNC machining center. Under different vibration frequencies of saw and feeding 
      rates measured from orthognathic surgery, sawing forces were recorded by a signal
      acquisition system. RESULTS: Remarkably different sawing forces were measured
      from different cadavers. Feed and vibration frequency of the reciprocating saw
      could determine the cutting forces only on 1 body. To reduce the impact of bone
      thickness changes on the cutting force measurements, all the cutting force data
      should be converted to the force of unit cutting length. The vibration frequency 
      of haptic feedback system is determined by main cutting forces. Fast Fourier
      transform method can be used to calculate the frequency of this system. To
      simulate surgery in higher fidelity, all the sawing forces from the experiment
      should be amended by experienced surgeons before use in virtual reality surgery
      simulator. CONCLUSIONS: Sawing force signals of different ages for force feedback
      were measured successfully, and more factors related to the bone mechanical
      properties, such as bone density, should be concerned in the future.

PG  - 1732-7
LID - 10.1007/s00268-012-1564-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare fresh-frozen cadavers (FFC) with
      a high-fidelity virtual reality simulator (VRS) as training tools in minimal
      access surgery for complex and relatively simple procedures. METHODS: A
      prospective comparative face validity study between FFC and VRS (LAP Mentor())
      was performed. Surgeons were recruited to perform tasks on both FFC and VRS
      appropriately paired to their experience level. Group A (senior) performed a
      laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy, Group B (intermediate) performed a laparoscopic
      incisional hernia repair, and Group C (junior) performed basic laparoscopic tasks
      (BLT) (camera manipulation, hand-eye coordination, tissue dissection and
      hand-transferring skills). Each subject completed a 5-point Likert-type
      questionnaire rating the training modalities in nine domains. Data were analysed 
      using nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Forty-five surgeons were recruited to
      participate (15 per skill group). Median scores for subjects in Group A were
      significantly higher for evaluation of FFC in all nine domains compared to VRS (p
      < 0.01). Group B scored FFC significantly better (p < 0.05) in all domains except
      task replication (p = 0.06). Group C scored FFC significantly better (p < 0.01)
      in eight domains but not on performance feedback (p = 0.09). When compared across
      groups, juniors accepted VRS as a training model more than did intermediate and
      senior groups on most domains (p < 0.01) except team work. CONCLUSIONS:
      Fresh-frozen cadaver is perceived as a significantly overall better model for
      laparoscopic training than the high-fidelity VRS by all training grades,
      irrespective of the complexity of the operative procedure performed. VRS is still
      useful when training junior trainees in BLT.

TI  - Simulation-based medical education in clinical skills laboratory.
PG  - 28-35
AB  - Clinical skills laboratories have been established in medical institutions as
      facilities for simulation-based medical education (SBME). SBME is believed to be 
      superior to the traditional style of medical education from the viewpoint of the 
      active and adult learning theories. SBME can provide a learning cycle of
      debriefing and feedback for learners as well as evaluation of procedures and
      competency. SBME offers both learners and patients a safe environment for
      practice and error. In a full-environment simulation, learners can obtain not
      only technical skills but also non-technical skills, such as leadership, team
      work, communication, situation awareness, decision-making, and awareness of
      personal limitations. SBME is also effective for integration of clinical medicine
      and basic medicine. In addition, technology-enhanced simulation training is
      associated with beneficial effects for outcomes of knowledge, skills, behaviors, 
      and patient-related outcomes. To perform SBME, effectively, not only simulators
      including high-fidelity mannequin-type simulators or virtual-reality simulators
      but also full-time faculties and instructors as professionals of SBME are
      essential in a clinical skills laboratory for SBME. Clinical skills laboratory is
      expected to become an integrated medical education center to achieve continuing
      professional development, integrated learning of basic and clinical medicine, and
      citizens' participation and cooperation in medical education.

LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2012.43 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, consumers have witnessed a technological revolution that has
      delivered more-realistic experiences in their own homes through high-definition, 
      stereoscopic televisions and natural, gesture-based video game consoles. Although
      these experiences are more realistic, offering higher levels of fidelity, it is
      not clear how the increased display and interaction aspects of fidelity impact
      the user experience. Since immersive virtual reality (VR) allows us to achieve
      very high levels of fidelity, we designed and conducted a study that used a
      six-sided CAVE to evaluate display fidelity and interaction fidelity
      independently, at extremely high and low levels, for a VR first-person shooter
      (FPS) game. Our goal was to gain a better understanding of the effects of
      fidelity on the user in a complex, performance-intensive context. The results of 
      our study indicate that both display and interaction fidelity significantly
      affect strategy and performance, as well as subjective judgments of presence,
      engagement, and usability. In particular, performance results were strongly in
      favor of two conditions: low-display, low-interaction fidelity (representative of
      traditional FPS games) and high-display, high-interaction fidelity (similar to
      the real world).

TI  - Comparative performance of high-fidelity training models for flexible
      ureteroscopy: Are all models effective?
PG  - 451-6
LID - 10.4103/0970-1591.91431 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We performed a comparative study of high-fidelity training models for 
      flexible ureteroscopy (URS). Our objective was to determine whether high-fidelity
      non-virtual reality (VR) models are as effective as the VR model in teaching
      flexible URS skills. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one trained urologists without
      clinical experience of flexible URS underwent dry lab simulation practice. After 
      a warm-up period of 2 h, tasks were performed on a high-fidelity non-VR
      (Uro-scopic Trainer; Endo-Urologie-Modell) and a high-fidelity VR model (URO
      Mentor). The participants were divided equally into three batches with rotation
      on each of the three stations for 30 min. Performance of the trainees was
      evaluated by an expert ureteroscopist using pass rating and global rating score
      (GRS). The participants rated a face validity questionnaire at the end of each
      session. RESULTS: The GRS improved statistically at evaluation performed after
      second rotation (P<0.001 for batches 1, 2 and 3). Pass ratings also improved
      significantly for all training models when the third and first rotations were
      compared (P<0.05). The batch that was trained on the VR-based model had more
      improvement on pass ratings on second rotation but could not achieve statistical 
      significance. Most of the realistic domains were higher for a VR model as
      compared with the non-VR model, except the realism of the flexible endoscope.
      CONCLUSIONS: All the models used for training flexible URS were effective in
      increasing the GRS and pass ratings irrespective of the VR status.

TI  - Simulating laparoscopic renal hilar vessel injuries: preliminary evaluation of a 
      novel surgical training model for residents.
PG  - 393-7
LID - 10.1089/end.2011.0432 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many surgical training programs utilize simulation-based strategies
      for instruction and assessment of laparoscopic skills. While the use of
      inanimate, animate, and virtual-reality simulation for basic or procedural skills
      training has been well described, the use of simulation for the purpose of
      training surgeons in managing intraoperative laparoscopic complications has been 
      given less attention. We describe a novel, affordable inanimate surgical model
      for use in simulation-based training of laparoscopic renal hilar vessel injury
      management. METHODS: Using a laparoscopic box trainer, a half-inch Penrose drain,
      standard silicone intravenous tubing, and a commercially available kidney
      part-task trainer, an inanimate surgical training model was developed to simulate
      various clinical scenarios involving renal hilar vessel injuries. To evaluate the
      construct validity of this training model, urology residents from the University 
      of California, Irvine, completed a simulated scenario involving a renal vein
      injury (RVI) during laparoscopic radical nephrectomy (LRN). RESULTS: This
      surgical model is able to simulate both renal arterial and venous injuries during
      laparoscopic radical and partial nephrectomy scenarios. Initial cost to construct
      the model was ~800 U.S. dollars (USD) and each subsequent use was an additional 7
      USD. Resident training level correlated strongly with technical performance
      (p<0.01) and "blood loss" (p=0.02) during the "RVI during LRN" scenario. The
      checklist and global rating scale used to assess performance demonstrated
      adequate reliability (Cronbach's alpha=0.82). CONCLUSIONS: While further
      validation, technical refinement, and improved fidelity are being considered, we 
      present a novel, affordable surgical model for simulating laparoscopic renal
      hilar vessel injuries that is suitable for urology trainees.

TI  - Self vs expert assessment of technical and non-technical skills in high fidelity 
      simulation.
PG  - 500-6
LID - 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2011.01.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment is imperative for learning, feedback and
      progression. The aim of this study was to examine whether surgeons can accurately
      self-assess their technical and nontechnical skills compared with expert faculty 
      members' assessments. METHODS: Twenty-five surgeons performed a laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy (LC) in a simulated operating room. Technical and nontechnical
      performance was assessed by participants and faculty members using the validated 
      Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) and the Non-Technical
      Skills for Surgeons scale (NOTSS). RESULTS: Assessment of technical performance
      correlated between self and faculty members' ratings for experienced (median
      score, 30.0 vs 31.0; rho = .831; P = .001) and inexperienced (median score, 22.0 
      vs 28.0; rho = .761; P = .003) surgeons. Assessment of nontechnical skills
      between self and faculty members did not correlate for experienced surgeons
      (median score, 8.0 vs 10.5; rho = -.375; P = .229) or their more inexperienced
      counterparts (median score, 9.0 vs 7.0; rho = -.018; P = .953). CONCLUSIONS:
      Surgeons can accurately self-assess their technical skills in virtual reality LC.
      Conversely, formal assessment with faculty members' input is required for
      nontechnical skills, for which surgeons lack insight into their behaviours.

AB  - The ability to acquire surgical skills requires consistent practice, and evidence
      suggests that many of these technical skills can be learnt away from the
      operating theatre. The aim of this review article is to discuss the importance of
      surgical simulation today and its various types, exploring the effectiveness of
      simulation in the clinical setting and its challenges for the future. Surgical
      simulation offers the opportunity for trainees to practise their surgical skills 
      prior to entering the operating theatre, allowing detailed feedback and objective
      assessment of their performance. This enables better patient safety and standards
      of care. Surgical simulators can be divided into organic or inorganic simulators.
      Organic simulators, consisting of live animal and fresh human cadaver models, are
      considered to be of high-fidelity. Inorganic simulators comprise virtual reality 
      simulators and synthetic bench models. Current evidence suggests that skills
      acquired through training with simulators, positively transfers to the clinical
      setting and improves operative outcome. The major challenge for the future
      revolves around understanding the value of this new technology and developing an 
      educational curriculum that can incorporate surgical simulators.

      intravenous cannulation.
PG  - 213-7
LID - 10.1097/SIH.0b013e31821d08a9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This article focuses on the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)
      simulation training for intravenous (IV) cannulation. We analyzed the learning
      process in skills acquisition from groups with limited experience in comparison
      with the performance of experts. METHODS: Novices (n = 20) and intermediates (n =
      23) trained on nine IV cannulation scenarios with a high-fidelity VR simulator
      (Virtual IV). Another three scenarios were performed before and after training
      (pre- and postassessment). Pre-/postassessment was also undertaken by a group of 
      10 experts for comparative evaluation. Performance metrics included the
      completion time and an error score that was obtained after quantitative analysis 
      of the errors committed during training. The learning curves were evaluated by
      recording the number of attempts required to successfully perform each training
      scenario. A performance was considered successful when the error score was below 
      a predetermined threshold. RESULTS: The learning curves of intermediates and
      novices demonstrated a clear plateau at the sixth and eighth scenario,
      respectively. These plateaus were reached after 15 (intermediates) and 23
      (novices) attempts. There was a highly significant reduction in the time and
      errors between pre- and postassessment (P < 0.01). Before training, the
      performance (errors, time) of the three groups was significantly different to one
      another (novices: lowest, experts: highest, P < 0.05). After training, the
      performance of intermediates and novices was equivalent to that of the experts (P
      > 0.1). Intermediates committed fewer critical and more noncritical errors than
      novices, and vice versa (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Simulation training enhanced the
      skills of inexperienced subjects significantly. The VR simulator demonstrated
      construct validity for three different levels of experience. The number of
      attempts over a series of equal difficulty scenarios provides a valuable
      alternative to the traditional measures of the learning curve.

TI  - Surgeon's vigilance in the operating room.
PG  - 673-7
LID - 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2011.01.016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surgeons' vigilance regarding patient condition was assessed using
      eye-tracking techniques during a simulated laparoscopic procedure. METHODS:
      Surgeons were required to perform a partial cholecystectomy in a virtual reality 
      trainer (SurgicalSim; METI Inc, Sarasota, FL) while wearing a lightweight
      head-mounted eye-tracker (Locarna systems Inc, Victoria, British Columbia,
      Canada). Half of the patients were preprogrammed to present a mildly unstable
      cardiac condition during the procedure. Surgical performance (evaluated by task
      time, instrument trajectory, and errors), mental workload (by the National
      Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index), and eye movement were
      recorded and compared between 13 experienced and 10 novice surgeons. RESULTS:
      Experienced surgeons took longer to complete the task and also made more errors. 
      The overall workload reported by surgeons was similar, but expert surgeons
      reported a higher level of frustration and a lower level of physical demands.
      Surgeon workload was greater when operating on the unstable patient than on the
      stable patient. Novices performed faster but focused more of their attention on
      the surgical task. In contrast, experts glanced more frequently at the anesthetic
      monitor. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the usefulness of using eye-tracking
      technology to measure a surgeon's vigilance during an operation. Eye-tracking
      observations can lead to inferences about a surgeon's behavior for patient
      safety. The unsatisfactory performance of expert surgeons on the VR simulator
      suggests that the fidelity of the virtual simulator needs to improve to enable
      surgeons to transfer their clinical skills. This, in turn, suggests using caution
      when having clinical experts as instructors to teach skills with virtual
      simulators.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Chief Medical Officer's 2008 annual report highlighted the
      importance of simulation in medical training. Simulator development has focused
      on increasing authenticity and fidelity. Development has not necessarily been
      guided by evidence for educational improvement. On reviewing 34 years of
      literature, Issenberg et al identified ten features of high-fidelity medical
      simulators that facilitate learning. This study compares cadaveric temporal bone 
      (CTB) simulation with the Voxel-Man TempoSurg (VT) virtual reality simulator in
      addressing these features. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was designed
      comparing the VT with CTB. Fourteen trainees and six consultants completed the
      questionnaire after using the simulator. RESULTS: The VT is better at allowing
      repetitive practice, ease of control of difficulty, and capturing clinical and
      pathological variation. The VT is as good as CTB in curriculum integration,
      allowing multiple learning strategies, providing a controlled environment,
      individualising learning and defining benchmarks. It appears worse with regards
      to face validity and feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality simulation and CTB
      have features that allow effective learning. Some of these are common to both, in
      some CTB is better and in others virtual reality is better. Virtual reality could
      be a significant mode of learning supplementary to CTB and experience in the
      operating theatre.

AB  - Simulation provides a range of educational tools that have increasingly been
      incorporated into emergency medicine (EM) curricula. Standardized patients and
      some partial task trainers, such as intubation heads, have been used for decades.
      More recently, a growing number of computer-screen simulations, high-fidelity
      mannequins, and virtual-reality simulators have expanded the number of procedures
      and conditions, which can be effectively simulated.The Accreditation Council for 
      Graduate Medical Education transitioned to a competency-based assessment of
      residency programs in 2001 and included simulation as a method for incorporating 
      the 6 core competencies into graduate medical education curricula. Over the past 
      decade, numerous peer-reviewed publications have promoted simulation as an
      effective educational tool for each of the core competencies.The advanced
      technology used to operate many current simulators can erroneously become the
      focus of efforts to create a simulation-based curriculum. Simulation can most
      effectively be incorporated into EM curricula through the use of time-proven
      concepts, which start with defining the targeted learners, assessing their
      general and specific educational needs, defining learning objectives, and
      selecting the best educational strategy for achieving each objective. In many,
      but not all, instances, simulation can be the best tool for achieving EM learning
      objectives.

AB  - Over the last couple of decades, learning through simulation has become
      popularised for various reasons and is continuing to expand exponentially despite
      a lack of robust evidence that it actually improves outcomes for patients and
      learners. There has been a particular growth in the use of high-fidelity virtual 
      reality simulators for surgical training as the technology has become more
      affordable. In the field of Otolaryngology, simulation appears to help teach
      simple procedural skills through to complex surgery of the temporal bone and
      paranasal sinuses. This is happening in an era when quality of care and patient
      safety are top of the agenda and cadaveric material is in short supply. In this
      article, we explore the history behind simulation, review the available evidence 
      and discuss its applications within Otolaryngology.

PG  - S38-40
AB  - There is increasing evidence that educating trainee surgeons by simulation is
      preferable to traditional operating-room training methods with actual patients.
      Apart from reducing costs and risks to patients, training by simulation can
      provide some unique benefits, such as greater control over the training procedure
      and more easily defined metrics for assessing proficiency. Virtual reality (VR)
      simulators are now playing an increasing role in surgical training. However,
      currently available VR simulators lack the fidelity to teach trainees past the
      novice-to-intermediate skills level. Recent technological developments in other
      industries using simulation, such as the games and entertainment and aviation
      industries, suggest that the next generation of VR simulators should be suitable 
      for training, maintenance and certification of advanced surgical skills. To be
      effective as an advanced surgical training and assessment tool, VR simulation
      needs to provide adequate and relevant levels of physical realism, case
      complexity and performance assessment. Proper validation of VR simulators and an 
      increased appreciation of their value by the medical profession are crucial for
      them to be accepted into surgical training curricula.

TI  - A novel approach for augmenting percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
      placement training.
PG  - 346-9
LID - 10.1097/SIH.0b013e3181f8eafa [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Surgical trainees routinely participate in percutaneous endoscopic 
      gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. Although simulation has gained widespread
      acceptance, novice trainees continue learning this procedure on real patients. We
      designed a novel hands-on training model for practicing PEG tube placement with
      minimal monetary investment (cost<$10). METHODS: Our portable low-fidelity bench 
      model has a simulated upper gastrointestinal construct made of foam. Seventeen
      trainees used our model to acquire and practice skills necessary to perform PEG
      tube placement, for setting up and troubleshooting upper gastrointestinal
      endoscope, and for using endoscopic instruments in the state-of-the-art simulated
      operative room. Thirteen trainees completed the course evaluation, using a
      5-point Likert scale (5=strongly agree). RESULTS: The training resulted in a
      self-reported increase in equipment familiarity (4.23+/-0.73) and troubleshooting
      real endoscope (4.69+/-0.48), and trainees felt better prepared (4.23+/-0.93) for
      performing PEG tube placement on real patients. Trainees agreed that this
      exercise has more educational value than using virtual reality simulator alone
      (4.38+/-0.52). CONCLUSIONS: Procedural training for PEG tube placement using a
      simple bench training model is perceived as valuable by trainees. Cost and
      commercial availability can be overcome by innovation in surgical simulation.

TI  - The (human) science of medical virtual learning environments.
PG  - 276-85
LID - 10.1098/rstb.2010.0209 [doi]
AB  - The uptake of virtual simulation technologies in both military and civilian
      surgical contexts has been both slow and patchy. The failure of the virtual
      reality community in the 1990s and early 2000s to deliver affordable and
      accessible training systems stems not only from an obsessive quest to develop the
      'ultimate' in so-called 'immersive' hardware solutions, from head-mounted
      displays to large-scale projection theatres, but also from a comprehensive lack
      of attention to the needs of the end users. While many still perceive the science
      of simulation to be defined by technological advances, such as computing power,
      specialized graphics hardware, advanced interactive controllers, displays and so 
      on, the true science underpinning simulation--the science that helps to guarantee
      the transfer of skills from the simulated to the real--is that of human factors, 
      a well-established discipline that focuses on the abilities and limitations of
      the end user when designing interactive systems, as opposed to the more
      commercially explicit components of technology. Based on three surgical
      simulation case studies, the importance of a human factors approach to the design
      of appropriate simulation content and interactive hardware for medical simulation
      is illustrated. The studies demonstrate that it is unnecessary to pursue
      real-world fidelity in all instances in order to achieve psychological
      fidelity--the degree to which the simulated tasks reproduce and foster knowledge,
      skills and behaviours that can be reliably transferred to real-world training
      applications.

      porcine and a virtual reality (VR) simulation model.
PG  - 1753-6
LID - 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2010.09753.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: * To compare the content validity (realism and usefulness) of
      percutaneous renal access (PRA) obtained on a live porcine model and a
      high-fidelity computer-based surgical simulator (PERC Mentor, Simbionix; Lod,
      Israel) in our skills laboratory for trainees interested in PRA training, so as
      to determine which of the two is a more appropriate and effective training model.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: * In all, 24 'experts' performed PRA in a live porcine
      model and using the PERC Mentor. * The porcine model access required a live
      anaesthetized pig with a pre-placed ureteric catheter. The access was done with
      flouroscopic guidance using a 22-G 'skinny' needle (Cook Medical, Bloomington,
      IN, USA). * Then the specific task of PRA using a similar case scenario was done 
      using the PERC Mentor. * The experts rated the models using a questionnaire based
      on a 5-point Likert scale, consisting of 10- and three-items of realism and
      usefulness, respectively. RESULTS: * Of the 10 items of realism assessed, the
      porcine model was rated as better than the PERC Mentor for 'overall realism',
      'movement of the kidney', 'tactile feedback of perinephric space', 'fluoroscopic 
      realism' and 'complications encountered' (All P < 0.001). * It was inferior to
      the PERC Mentor for 'orientation to the flank', 'aspiration', 'repetitive
      performance' and 'organisational feasibility' (All P < 0.001). * 'Tactile
      feedback of successful access' was similar in both models (mean [sd] points, 4.24
      [0.7] vs 4.6 [0.5]). * Of the three items of usefulness, 'overall usefulness'
      (4.6 [0.6] vs 4.65 [0.5]) and 'use as a training tool' (4.32 [0.5] vs 4.75 [0.4])
      was similar; however, the porcine model was a much better assessment tool (P <
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: * Both models have relative advantages and disadvantages.
      The live porcine model is a more realistic assessment tool for PRA. The specific 
      advantage of the PERC Mentor is of repetitive tasking and easier set up
      feasibility. * The overall usefulness was same for both the models.

      training in conventional transbronchial needle aspiration and user preferences.
PG  - 327-34
LID - 10.1159/000318674 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) can be learned
      using high-fidelity virtual-reality platforms and low-fidelity models comprised
      of molded silicone or excised animal airways. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this
      study was to determine perceptions and preferences of learners and instructors
      regarding the comparative effectiveness of low-fidelity and high-fidelity
      bronchoscopy simulation for training in TBNA. METHODS: During the 2008 annual
      CHEST conference, a prospective randomized crossover design was used to train
      study participants in three methods of conventional TBNA using low- and
      high-fidelity models. Likert style questions were administered to learners and
      instructors in order to elicit preferences and opinions regarding educational
      effectiveness of the models. Results were tabulated and depicted in graphic
      format, with medians calculated. RESULTS: Learners felt that the models were
      equally enjoyable (13-13) and enthusiasm generating (low 17-high 15). There was
      preference for low-fidelity in terms of realism (23-17), ease of learning (20-6),
      and learning all three TBNA methods (31-7 for hub-against-wall, 31-6 for jabbing,
      29-6 for piggyback). Low-fidelity was preferred as an ideal model overall
      (19-11). Instructors thought that low-fidelity was more useful in teaching TBNA
      (9-0 for all three methods). Instructors perceived the low-fidelity model overall
      as an ideal tool for learning TBNA (8-0) and a more effective teaching instrument
      (8-0). CONCLUSION: Based on learner and instructor perceptions, a low-fidelity
      model is superior to a high-fidelity platform for training in three methods of
      conventional TBNA.

TI  - A virtual reality simulator for teaching and evaluating dental procedures.
PG  - 396-405
LID - 10.3414/ME9310 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We present a dental training system with a haptic interface that
      allows dental students or experts to practice dental procedures in a virtual
      environment. The simulator is able to monitor and classify the performance of an 
      operator into novice or expert categories. The intelligent training module allows
      a student to simultaneously and proactively follow the correct dental procedures 
      demonstrated by an intelligent tutor. METHODS: The virtual reality (VR) simulator
      simulates the tooth preparation procedure both graphically and haptically, using 
      a video display and haptic device. We evaluated the performance of users using
      hidden Markov models (HMMs) incorporating various data collected by the
      simulator. We implemented an intelligent training module which is able to record 
      and replay the procedure that was performed by an expert and allows students to
      follow the correct steps and apply force proactively by themselves while
      reproducing the procedure. RESULTS: We find that the level of graphics and
      haptics fidelity is acceptable as evaluated by dentists. The accuracy of the
      objective performance assessment using HMMs is encouraging with 100 percent
      accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The simulator can simulate realistic tooth surface
      exploration and cutting. The accuracy of automatic performance assessment system 
      using HMMs is also acceptable on relatively small data sets. The intelligent
      training allows skill transfer in a proactive manner which is an advantage over
      the passive method in a traditional training. We will soon conduct experiments
      with more participants and implement a variety of training strategies.

TI  - Modeling the early stage of DNA sequence recognition within RecA nucleoprotein
      filaments.
PG  - 6313-23
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkq459 [doi]
AB  - Homologous recombination is a fundamental process enabling the repair of
      double-strand breaks with a high degree of fidelity. In prokaryotes, it is
      carried out by RecA nucleofilaments formed on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). These 
      filaments incorporate genomic sequences that are homologous to the ssDNA and
      exchange the homologous strands. Due to the highly dynamic character of this
      process and its rapid propagation along the filament, the sequence recognition
      and strand exchange mechanism remains unknown at the structural level. The
      recently published structure of the RecA/DNA filament active for recombination
      (Chen et al., Mechanism of homologous recombination from the RecA-ssDNA/dsDNA
      structure, Nature 2008, 453, 489) provides a starting point for new exploration
      of the system. Here, we investigate the possible geometries of association of the
      early encounter complex between RecA/ssDNA filament and double-stranded DNA
      (dsDNA). Due to the huge size of the system and its dense packing, we use a
      reduced representation for protein and DNA together with state-of-the-art
      molecular modeling methods, including systematic docking and virtual reality
      simulations. The results indicate that it is possible for the double-stranded DNA
      to access the RecA-bound ssDNA while initially retaining its Watson-Crick
      pairing. They emphasize the importance of RecA L2 loop mobility for both
      recognition and strand exchange.

PG  - 605-17
LID - 10.1016/j.suc.2010.02.005 [doi]
AB  - With recent concerns regarding patient safety, and legislation regarding resident
      work hours, it is accepted that a certain amount of surgical skills training will
      transition to the surgical skills laboratory. Virtual reality offers enormous
      potential to enhance technical and non-technical skills training outside the
      operating room. Virtual-reality systems range from basic low-fidelity devices to 
      highly complex virtual environments. These systems can act as training and
      assessment tools, with the learned skills effectively transferring to an
      analogous clinical situation. Recent developments include expanding the role of
      virtual reality to allow for holistic, multidisciplinary team training in
      simulated operating rooms, and focusing on the role of virtual reality in
      evidence-based surgical curriculum design.

TI  - Development and face validity testing of a three-dimensional myringotomy
      simulator with haptic feedback.
PG  - 122-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Considerable progress has been made in the development of
      three-dimensional temporal bone virtual reality simulators. However, very little 
      attention has been paid to interactive simulation of middle ear surgery,
      including myringotomy. As the development of technical skills for middle ear
      surgery has a steep learning curve, this poses inherent risks to patients during 
      the skills acquisition phase. The benefit of simulation training in the
      acquisition of surgical skills has been demonstrated with previous low-fidelity
      models. Tactile sensation is an important feedback mechanism in middle ear
      surgery, so a three-dimensional virtual reality myringotomy simulator with haptic
      feedback was developed at The University of Western Ontario. OBJECTIVE: To
      examine the face validity of a three-dimensional myringotomy simulator with
      haptic feedback. METHODS: The three-dimensional myringotomy simulator was
      calibrated with input from two otolaryngologists and one intermediate-level
      resident. The face validity of the resulting simulator was tested by four staff
      otolaryngologists and seven intermediate- or senior-level residents using a
      previously validated questionnaire. RESULTS: The results demonstrate good to
      excellent face validity for the myringotomy simulator with high consistency
      between participants with a Cronbach alpha of .919. Favourable responses
      predominated for all questions with the exception of force feedback, where the
      average response was neutral. CONCLUSIONS: The initial results from the
      development and testing of a three-dimensional virtual myringotomy simulator with
      haptic feedback are very encouraging. This simulator is the first of its kind
      and, with further refinement, has excellent potential to be of benefit in the
      training of proficient middle ear surgeons.

TI  - The use of virtual reality tools in surgical education.
PG  - 50-1
AB  - Advances in computing, specifically those used for simulation and games
      technology has allowed for exciting developments in dental and surgical
      education. At the same time concerns are being raised that students with
      relatively little training, practise to improve their skill on patients with all 
      of the inherent risks that may occur. Simulation in dentistry has been practised 
      for many years and so the concept is not new to the profession. New tools have
      been developed that both enhance teaching and learning and are also useful for
      assessment of students and trainees. The challenge of virtual and simulated
      reality tools is to have the required fidelity to improve teaching and learning
      outcomes over the currently utilized methodology.

LID - 10.1016/j.jvir.2009.09.019 [doi]
AB  - Training in endovascular intervention ultimately aims to produce
      interventionalists who demonstrate competence in technical skills. Herein, the
      authors investigate the rationale for simulation-based training by providing an
      overview of the psychological theories underpinning acquisition of technical
      skills, training and assessment history, recent advances in simulation
      technology, and a critical appraisal of their role in training and assessment in 
      endovascular intervention. Simulators have potential for training and assessment 
      and promise solution to many shortcomings of traditional 'apprenticeship'
      training models. Before inclusion into the curriculum, further work is needed
      regarding fidelity, validity, reliability, and design of simulators to ensure
      accurate transfer of acquired endovascular skills from simulator to patient.

      Incidents.
PG  - 59
LID - 10.3389/neuro.08.059.2009 [doi]
AB  - This paper reviews experimental methods for the study of the responses of people 
      to violence in digital media, and in particular considers the issues of internal 
      validity and ecological validity or generalisability of results to events in the 
      real world. Experimental methods typically involve a significant level of
      abstraction from reality, with participants required to carry out tasks that are 
      far removed from violence in real life, and hence their ecological validity is
      questionable. On the other hand studies based on field data, while having
      ecological validity, cannot control multiple confounding variables that may have 
      an impact on observed results, so that their internal validity is questionable.
      It is argued that immersive virtual reality may provide a unification of these
      two approaches. Since people tend to respond realistically to situations and
      events that occur in virtual reality, and since virtual reality simulations can
      be completely controlled for experimental purposes, studies of responses to
      violence within virtual reality are likely to have both ecological and internal
      validity. This depends on a property that we call 'plausibility' - including the 
      fidelity of the depicted situation with prior knowledge and expectations. We
      illustrate this with data from a previously published experiment, a virtual
      reprise of Stanley Milgram's 1960s obedience experiment, and also with pilot data
      from a new study being developed that looks at bystander responses to violent
      incidents.

TI  - The impact of constructive feedback on training in gastrointestinal endoscopy
      using high-fidelity Virtual-Reality simulation: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 181-5
LID - 10.1136/gut.2009.191825 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, virtual reality computer simulators have been used to
      enhance traditional endoscopy teaching. Previous studies have demonstrated
      construct validity of these systems and transfer of virtual skills to the
      operating room. However, to date no simulator-training curricula have been
      designed and there is very little evidence on the impact of external feedback on 
      acquisition of endoscopic skills. The aim of the present study was to assess the 
      impact of external feedback on the learning curves on a VR colonoscopy simulator 
      using inexperienced trainees. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 22 trainees, without
      colonoscopy experience were randomised to a group which received structured
      feedback provided by an experienced supervisor and a controlled group. All
      participants performed 15 repetitions of task 3 from the Introduction colonoscopy
      module of the Accu Touch Endoscopy simulator. Retention/transfer tests on
      simulator were performed 4-6 weeks after the last repetition. The proficiency
      levels were based on the performance of eight experienced colonoscopists.
      RESULTS: All subjects were able to complete the procedure on the simulator. There
      were no perforations in the feedback group versus seven in the non-feedback
      group. Subjects in the feedback group reached expert proficiency levels in
      percentage of mucosa visualised and time to reach the caecum significantly faster
      compared with the control group. None of the groups demonstrated significant
      degradation of performance in simulator retention/transfer tests. CONCLUSION:
      Concurrent feedback given by supervisor concur an advantage in acquisition of
      basic colonoscopy skills and achieving of proficiency level as compared to
      independent training.

TI  - Virtual reality-based simulator for training in regional anaesthesia.
PG  - 594-600
LID - 10.1093/bja/aep224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The safe performance of regional anaesthesia (RA) requires
      theoretical knowledge and good manual skills. Virtual reality (VR)-based
      simulators may offer trainees a safe environment to learn and practice different 
      techniques. However, currently available VR simulators do not consider individual
      anatomy, which limits their use for realistic training. We have developed a
      VR-based simulator that can be used for individual anatomy and for different
      anatomical regions. METHODS: Individual data were obtained from magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) without contrast
      agent to represent morphology and the vascular system, respectively. For data
      handling, registration, and segmentation, an application based on the Medical
      Imaging Interaction Toolkit was developed. Suitable segmentation algorithms such 
      as the fuzzy c-means clustering approach were integrated, and a hierarchical tree
      data structure was created to model the flexible anatomical structures of
      peripheral nerve cords. The simulator was implemented in the VR toolkit ViSTA
      using modules for collision detection, virtual humanoids, interaction, and
      visualization. A novel algorithm for electric impulse transmission is the core of
      the simulation. RESULTS: In a feasibility study, MRI morphology and MRA were
      acquired from five subjects for the inguinal region. From these sources,
      three-dimensional anatomical data sets were created and nerves modelled. The
      resolution obtained from both MRI and MRA was sufficient for realistic
      simulations. Our high-fidelity simulator application allows trainees to perform
      virtual peripheral nerve blocks based on these data sets and models. CONCLUSIONS:
      Subject-specific training of RA is supported in a virtual environment. We have
      adapted segmentation algorithms and developed a VR-based simulator for the
      inguinal region for use in training for different peripheral nerve blocks. In
      contrast to available VR-based simulators, our simulation offers anatomical
      variety.

TI  - Development of a virtual reality training curriculum for laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy.
PG  - 1086-93
LID - 10.1002/bjs.6679 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Training within a proficiency-based virtual reality (VR) curriculum
      may reduce errors during real surgical procedures. This study used a scientific
      methodology for development of a VR training curriculum for laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. METHODS: Inexperienced (had performed fewer than ten
      laparoscopic cholecystectomies), intermediate (20-50) and experienced (more than 
      100) surgeons were recruited. Construct validity was defined as the ability to
      differentiate between the three levels of experience, based on simulator-derived 
      metrics for nine basic skills, four procedural tasks and full laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy on a high-fidelity VR simulator. Inexperienced subjects performed
      ten repetitions for learning curve analysis. Proficiency measures were based on
      the performance of experienced surgeons. RESULTS: Thirty inexperienced, 11
      intermediate and 16 experienced operators were recruited. Eight of nine basic
      skills and three of four procedural tasks were found to be construct valid. The
      full procedure revealed significant intergroup differences for time (1541, 673
      and 816 s; P = 0.002), movements (1021, 595 and 638; P = 0.006) and path length
      (2038, 1235 and 1303 cm; P = 0.033). Learning curves plateaued between the second
      and ninth sessions. CONCLUSION: This study shows that it is possible to define
      and develop a whole-procedure VR training curriculum for laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy using structured scientific methodology.

TI  - Interactive highly realistic virtual reality as a tool for understanding the
      genesis and treatment of psychotic symptoms.
PG  - 138-40
AB  - Schizophrenia can be a devastating lifelong psychotic disorder with a poor
      prognosis. National guidelines in the UK recommend the provision of cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) to all those suffering with psychotic disorders, but
      there is a lack of trained therapists in the UK able to provide such a treatment.
      Developing high quality automated technologies that can serve as an adjunct to
      conventional CBT should enhance the provision of this therapy, and increase the
      efficiency of the therapists in practice. The latter will occur by enabling
      alternate professionals to aid in the delivery of therapy, to enable behavioral
      experiments to be conducted in the clinic, and for sessions to be recorded and
      re-played such that the patient can deliver therapy to him or herself. As such
      the system will enable patients to become experts in, and providers of, their own
      treatment and decrease the number of sessions needed to be led by a trained CBT
      therapist. A key feature of any such system is the level of realism required to
      ensure a compelling session in which the user is not adversely affected by the
      system itself. This paper presents a high-fidelity virtual environment to help
      better understand the environmental triggers for psychosis.

TI  - Assessment of early learning curves among nurses and physicians using a
      high-fidelity virtual-reality colonoscopy simulator.
PG  - 366-70
LID - 10.1007/s00464-009-0555-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, it has been suggested that nurses can perform diagnostic
      endoscopy procedures, which traditionally have been a physician's responsibility.
      The existing studies concerning quality of sigmoidoscopy performed by nurses are 
      small, used assessment tools with insufficient validation and to date there is
      very little knowledge of the learning curve patterns for physicians and nurses.
      The aim of a present study was to assess early learning curves on a
      virtual-reality colonoscopy simulator of untrained residents as compared with
      that of nurses with and without endoscopy assistance experience. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Thirty subjects were included in the study: 10 female residents (median 
      age 30.5 years) without colonoscopy experience, 10 female nurses (median age 27.5
      years) without endoscopy assistance experience and 10 female nurses (median age
      42 years) with endoscopy assistance experience. All participants performed 10
      repetitions of task 6 from the "Introduction" colonoscopy module of the Accu
      Touch Endoscopy simulator. Eight experienced colonoscopists performed three
      repetitions of task 6 in order to provide the reference expert level of
      performance. RESULTS: All subjects completed the virtual colonoscopy without
      complications. Significant differences existed between residents and nurses with 
      respect to time to complete the procedure. Residents and nurses showed similar
      learning curve patterns. There were not significant differences between the
      groups in terms of volume of insufflated air, percentage of time without
      discomfort, and percentage of mucosa seen. None of the trainee groups achieved
      expert proficiency level in terms of time and amount of insufflated air by the
      tenth repetition. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses performed virtual colonoscopy as accurately
      and safely as residents. Although the residents performed significantly faster,
      time differences showed a tendency towards decreasing, and appraisement of the
      numeric time differences seemed of minor practical importance. From a technical
      point of view this indicates that nurses may learn to perform colonoscopy after
      appropriate training.

PG  - 430-1
LID - 10.1179/174313208X353695 [doi]
AB  - Based on a study of 48 neurological residents using a high fidelity
      haptic/graphic virtual reality simulator to perform ventricular cannulation, we
      recorded absolute Euclidean distance from the catheter tip to the foramen of
      Monroe within the ventricle. The data suggest that as expected, successful first 
      attempts to cannulate the virtual 'shifted ventricle' are much less frequent than
      previous assessments with normal virtual ventricular anatomy. Furthermore, the
      significant improvement observed by the second attempt implies that the learning 
      curve has been affected and the process 'jump started'.

      Three experiments are reported in this paper. In these experiments we made use of
      VRCPAT to assess persons' neurocognitive and psychophysiological responses to
      high-fidelity, immersive virtual environments. The first experiment provided
      continued support for the validity of the VRCPAT as a measure of learning and
      memory through the use of an increased sample size. In the second experiment we
      aimed at assessing whether an increase in stimulus complexity would result in a
      significant decrease in performance on attentional tasks. We also wanted to see
      whether an increase in stimulus intensity would result in a significant decrease 
      in performance on attentional tasks. The third experiment looked at participants'
      psychophysiological responses in both low and high immersion virtual
      environments.

PG  - 1526-31
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0b013e31818ac1f0 [doi]
AB  - The three-dimensional (3D) temporomandibular joint (TMJ) model derives from a
      study of the cranium by 3D virtual reality and mandibular function animation. The
      starting point of the project is high-fidelity digital acquisition of a human dry
      skull. The cooperation between the maxillofacial surgeon and the cartoonist
      enables the reconstruction of the fibroconnective components of the TMJ that are 
      the keystone for comprehension of the anatomic and functional features of the
      mandible. The skeletal model is customized with the apposition of the
      temporomandibular ligament, the articular disk, the retrodiskal tissue, and the
      medial and the lateral ligament of the disk. The simulation of TMJ movement is
      the result of the integration of up-to-date data on the biomechanical
      restrictions. The 3D TMJ model is an easy-to-use application that may be run on a
      personal computer for the study of the TMJ and its biomechanics.

TI  - Understanding of anesthesia machine function is enhanced with a transparent
      reality simulation.
PG  - 26-32
LID - 10.1097/SIH.0b013e31816366d3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Photorealistic simulations may provide efficient transfer of
      certain skills to the real system, but by being opaque may fail to encourage
      deeper learning of the structure and function of the system. Schematic
      simulations that are more abstract, with less visual fidelity but make system
      structure and function transparent, may enhance deeper learning and optimize
      retention and transfer of learning. We compared learning effectiveness of these 2
      modes of externalizing the output of a common simulation engine (the Virtual
      Anesthesia Machine, VAM) that models machine function and dynamics and responds
      in real time to user interventions such as changes in gas flow or ventilation.
      METHODS: Undergraduate students (n = 39) and medical students (n = 35) were given
      a single, 1-hour guided learning session with either a Transparent or an Opaque
      version of the VAM simulation. The following day, the learners' knowledge of
      machine components, function, and dynamics was tested. RESULTS: The
      Transparent-VAM groups scored higher than the Opaque-VAM groups on a set of
      multiple-choice questions concerning conceptual knowledge about anesthesia
      machines (P = 0.009), provided better and more complete explanations of component
      function (P = 0.003), and were more accurate in remembering and inferring
      cause-and-effect dynamics of the machine and relations among components (P =
      0.003). Although the medical students outperformed undergraduates on all
      measures, a similar pattern of benefits for the Transparent VAM was observed for 
      these 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Schematic simulations that transparently allow
      learners to visualize, and explore, underlying system dynamics and relations
      among components may provide a more effective mental model for certain systems.
      This may lead to a deeper understanding of how the system works, and therefore,
      we believe, how to detect and respond to potentially adverse situations.

TI  - Fiberoptic oral intubation: the effect of model fidelity on training for transfer
      to patient care.
PG  - 1007-13
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0b013e31818d6c3c [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that fiberoptic orotracheal
      intubation (FOI) skills can be learned outside the operating room. The purpose of
      this study was to determine which of two educational interventions allows
      learners to gain greater capacity for performing the procedure. METHODS:
      Respiratory therapists were randomly assigned to a low-fidelity or high-fidelity 
      training model group. The low-fidelity group was guided by experts, on a
      nonanatomic model designed to refine fiberoptic manipulation skills. The
      high-fidelity group practiced their skills on a computerized virtual reality
      bronchoscopy simulator. After training, subjects performed two consecutive FOIs
      on healthy, anesthetized patients with predicted "easy" intubations. Each
      subject's FOI was evaluated by blinded examiners, using a validated global rating
      scale and checklist. Success and time were also measured. RESULTS: Data were
      analyzed using a two-way mixed design analysis of variance. There was no
      significant difference between the low-fidelity (n = 14) and high-fidelity (n =
      14) model groups when compared with the global rating scale, checklist, time, and
      success at achieving tracheal intubation (all P = not significant). Second
      attempts in both groups were significantly better than first attempts (P <
      0.001), and there was no interaction between "fidelity of training model" and
      "first versus second attempt" scores. CONCLUSIONS: There was no added benefit
      from training on a costly virtual reality model with respect to transfer of FOI
      skills to intraoperative patient care. Second attempts in both groups were
      significantly better than first attempts. Low-fidelity models for FOI training
      outside the operating room are an alternative for programs with budgetary
      constraints.

TI  - Using immersive simulation for training first responders for mass casualty
      incidents.
PG  - 1152-9

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A descriptive study was performed to better understand the possible
      utility of immersive virtual reality simulation for training first responders in 
      a mass casualty event. METHODS: Utilizing a virtual reality cave automatic
      virtual environment (CAVE) and high-fidelity human patient simulator (HPS), a
      group of experts modeled a football stadium that experienced a terrorist
      explosion during a football game. Avatars (virtual patients) were developed by
      expert consensus that demonstrated a spectrum of injuries ranging from death to
      minor lacerations. A group of paramedics was assessed by observation for
      decisions made and action taken. A critical action checklist was created and used
      for direct observation and viewing videotaped recordings. RESULTS: Of the 12
      participants, only 35.7% identified the type of incident they encountered. None
      identified a secondary device that was easily visible. All participants were
      enthusiastic about the simulation and provided valuable comments and insights.
      CONCLUSIONS: Learner feedback and expert performance review suggests that
      immersive training in a virtual environment has the potential to be a powerful
      tool to train first responders for high-acuity, low-frequency events, such as a
      terrorist attack.

TI  - Surgical simulation: a urological perspective.
PG  - 1690-9
LID - 10.1016/j.juro.2008.01.014 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Surgical education is changing rapidly as several factors including
      budget constraints and medicolegal concerns limit opportunities for urological
      trainees. New methods of skills training such as low fidelity bench trainers and 
      virtual reality simulators offer new avenues for surgical education. In addition,
      surgical simulation has the potential to allow practicing surgeons to develop new
      skills and maintain those they already possess. We provide a review of the
      background, current status and future directions of surgical simulators as they
      pertain to urology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a literature review and
      an overview of surgical simulation in urology. RESULTS: Surgical simulators are
      in various stages of development and validation. Several simulators have
      undergone extensive validation studies and are in use in surgical curricula.
      While virtual reality simulators offer the potential to more closely mimic
      reality and present entire operations, low fidelity simulators remain useful in
      skills training, particularly for novices and junior trainees. Surgical
      simulation remains in its infancy. However, the potential to shorten learning
      curves for difficult techniques and practice surgery without risk to patients
      continues to drive the development of increasingly more advanced and realistic
      models. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical simulation is an exciting area of surgical
      education. The future is bright as advancements in computing and graphical
      capabilities offer new innovations in simulator technology. Simulators must
      continue to undergo rigorous validation studies to ensure that time spent by
      trainees on bench trainers and virtual reality simulators will translate into
      improved surgical skills in the operating room.

TI  - Understanding perceptual boundaries in laparoscopic surgery.
PG  - 866-73
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2007.908068 [doi]
AB  - Human perceptual capabilities related to the laparoscopic interaction paradigm
      are not well known. Its study is important for the design of virtual reality
      simulators, and for the specification of augmented reality applications that
      overcome current limitations and provide a supersensing to the surgeon. As part
      of this work, this article addresses the study of laparoscopic pulling forces.
      Two definitions are proposed to focalize the problem: the perceptual fidelity
      boundary, limit of human perceptual capabilities, and the Utile fidelity
      boundary, that encapsulates the perceived aspects actually used by surgeons to
      guide an operation. The study is then aimed to define the perceptual fidelity
      boundary of laparoscopic pulling forces. This is approached with an experimental 
      design in which surgeons assess the resistance against pulling of four different 
      tissues, which are characterized with both in vivo interaction forces and ex vivo
      tissue biomechanical properties. A logarithmic law of tissue consistency
      perception is found comparing subjective valorizations with objective parameters.
      A model of this perception is developed identifying what the main parameters are:
      the grade of fixation of the organ, the tissue stiffness, the amount of tissue
      bitten, and the organ mass being pulled. These results are a clear requirement
      analysis for the force feedback algorithm of a virtual reality laparoscopic
      simulator. Finally, some discussion is raised about the suitability of augmented 
      reality applications around this surgical gesture.

TI  - Primer: cognitive motor learning for teaching surgical skill--how are surgical
      skills taught and assessed?
PG  - 47-54
LID - 10.1038/ncpuro0991 [doi]
AB  - As the practice of surgery evolves, the modalities by which future surgeons are
      trained must also develop. Traditionally, surgical trainees have learned through 
      a mentorship model, with the majority of cognitive motor learning for surgical
      skill being initiated and practiced within the operating room. This, however, is 
      no longer the ideal environment in which to acquire surgical skills and,
      subsequently, many surgical training programs are incorporating the use of other 
      surgical models within their curricula. Training on simulators, ranging from
      low-fidelity bench models to complex, high-fidelity virtual reality models, seems
      to be transferable and might prove to be a crucial supplement to the traditional 
      curriculum. Models that are reliable and valid, coupled with objective
      instruments that measure technical skill, might prove to be useful for
      evaluation. For a simulator to provide a good assessment of competency, it should
      either correlate to or predict the person's technical performance in the
      operating room. More research is, therefore, needed regarding the validity and
      transferability of various training models, particularly if they are to become a 
      form of assessment for certification or licensure.

TI  - Pq-space based non-photorealistic rendering for augmented reality.
PG  - 102-9
AB  - The increasing use of robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery (MIS) provides 
      an ideal environment for using Augmented Reality (AR) for performing image guided
      surgery. Seamless synthesis of AR depends on a number of factors relating to the 
      way in which virtual objects appear and visually interact with a real
      environment. Traditional overlaid AR approaches generally suffer from a loss of
      depth perception. This paper presents a new AR method for robotic assisted MIS,
      which uses a novel pq-space based non-photorealistic rendering technique for
      providing see-through vision of the embedded virtual object whilst maintaining
      salient anatomical details of the exposed anatomical surface. Experimental
      results with both phantom and in vivo lung lobectomy data demonstrate the visual 
      realism achieved for the proposed method and its accuracy in providing high
      fidelity AR depth perception.

TI  - A cost-effective approach to establishing a surgical skills laboratory.
PG  - 712-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies comparing inexpensive low-fidelity box trainers to
      expensive computer-based virtual reality systems demonstrate similar acquisition 
      of surgical skills and transferability to the clinical setting. With new mandates
      emerging that all surgical residency programs have access to a surgical skills
      laboratory, we describe our cost-effective approach to teaching basic and
      advanced open and laparoscopic skills utilizing inexpensive bench models, box
      trainers, and animate models. METHODS: Open models (basic skills, bowel
      anastomosis, vascular anastomosis, trauma skills) and laparoscopic models (basic 
      skills, cholecystectomy, Nissen fundoplication, suturing and knot tying, advanced
      in vivo skills) are constructed using a combination of materials found in our
      surgical research laboratories, retail stores, or donated by industry. Expired
      surgical materials are obtained from our hospital operating room and animal
      organs from food-processing plants. In vivo models are performed in an approved
      research facility. Operation, maintenance, and administration of the surgical
      skills laboratory are coordinated by a salaried manager, and instruction is the
      responsibility of all surgical faculty from our institution. RESULTS: Overall,
      the cost analyses of our initial startup costs and operational expenditures over 
      a 3-year period revealed a progressive decrease in yearly cost per resident
      (2002-2003, $1,151; 2003-2004, $1,049; and 2004-2005, $982). CONCLUSIONS: Our
      approach to surgical skills education can serve as a template for any surgery
      program with limited financial resources.

TI  - Correlating virtual reality and box trainer tasks in the assessment of
      laparoscopic surgical skills.
PG  - 546.e1-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation in the
      assessment of laparoscopic surgical skills in medical students with the use of a 
      virtual reality laparoscopic trainer and a low-fidelity video box trainer with
      comparative tasks. STUDY DESIGN: Third-year medical students were asked to
      perform 3 basic skills set modules on LapSim (Surgical Science, Gothenburg,
      Sweden): coordination, grasping and lifting, and handling the intestines. Each
      task was set at the easiest level, and each student was allowed a maximum of 10
      attempts to complete each task. Similar-appearing tasks were chosen for
      comparison with the use of a standard video box trainer: pegboard, cup drop and
      rope pass, respectively. Laparoscopic skills were evaluated with the use of both 
      trainers during 1 session. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to
      compare paired data on each student using statistical software. RESULTS:
      Forty-seven of 65 medical students were assigned to clinical clerkships on-campus
      at Temple University School of Medicine participated in the study. All 47
      students participated in the video box trainer tasks; 34 students completed both 
      the video box trainer and LapSim skills set. Observations that were obtained on
      the LapSim virtual reality system and video box trainer simulator demonstrated
      several correlations. The time to completion for the LapSim coordination task and
      the pegboard task were correlated (r = 0.507; P = .006), as were the grasping and
      lifting task completion time on LapSim and the comparative box trainer cup drop
      task completion time (r = 0.404; P = .022). When accounting for errors, the
      LapSim coordination task tissue damage score was correlated with the sum of all
      box trainer errors (r = 0.353; P = .040); the average grasping and lifting tissue
      damage was correlated with the total number of errors during all box trainer
      tasks (r = 0.374; P = .035). CONCLUSION: Overall, in evaluating laparoscopic
      skills, the LapSim and video box trainer were correlated positively with one
      another. The scoring of laparoscopic skills by both systems appears to be
      equivalent for the measurement of time to task completion and number of errors.

TI  - Three-dimensional touch interface for medical education.
PG  - 251-63
AB  - We present the technical principle and evaluation of a multimodal virtual reality
      (VR) system for medical education, called a touch simulator. This touch simulator
      comes with an innovative three-dimensional (3-D) touch sensitive input device.
      The device comprises a six-axis force-torque sensor connected to a tangible
      object representing the shape of an anatomical structure. Information related to 
      the point of contact is recorded by the sensor, processed, and audiovisually
      displayed. The touch simulator provides a high level of user-friendliness and
      fidelity compared to other purely graphically oriented simulation environments.
      In this paper, the touch simulator has been realized as an interactive
      neuroanatomical training simulator. The user can visualize and manipulate
      graphical information of the brain surface or different cross-sectional slices by
      a finger-touch on a brain-like shaped tangible object. We evaluated the system by
      theoretical derivations, experiments, and subjective questionnaires. In the
      theoretical analysis, we could show that the contact point estimation error
      mainly depends on the accuracy and the noise of the sensor, the amount and
      direction of the applied force, and the geometry of the tangible object. The
      theoretical results could be validated by experiments: applying a normal force of
      10 N on a 120 mm x 120 mm x 120 mm cube causes a maximum error of 2.5 +/- 0.7 mm.
      This error becomes smaller when increasing the contact force. Based on the survey
      results, the touch simulator may be a useful tool for assisting medical schools
      in the visualization of brain image data and the study of neuroanatomy.

TI  - Field dependency and the sense of object-presence in haptic virtual environments.
PG  - 243-51
AB  - Virtual environment (VE) users often report having a sense of being present in
      the virtual place or a sense that the virtual object is present in their
      environment. This sense of presence depends on both the technological fidelity
      (e.g., in graphics, haptics) and the users' cognitive/ personality
      characteristics. This study examined the correlation between user's cognitive
      style on the field-dependency dimension and the level of object-presence they
      reported in a haptic VE. Results indicated that field-independent individuals
      reported higher presence ratings compared to field-dependent participants. We
      hypothesize that field-independents' advantage in reorganizing the perceptual
      field and constructing it according to their previously acquired internal
      knowledge enables them to cognitively reconstruct the VE experience more
      efficiently by selectively attending only to the relevant cues and by filling in 
      the gap of missing information with their previous knowledge and creative
      imagination. This active and creative cognitive process may be behind the
      enhanced sense of presence. In addition, we raise a possible linkage between
      field dependency, the sense of presence, and simulator sickness phenomenon.

TI  - Low-fidelity ureteroscopy models.
PG  - 248-51
AB  - For several reasons, there has been pressure to seek alternatives to the
      Halstedian method of surgical training, both for residents and for practicing
      surgeons faced with a new procedure. The use of bench models to train urology
      residents in order to maximize their operating-room experience is becoming
      popular. Realistic latex models and virtual-reality simulators have been
      introduced. However, the model does not have to look realistic as long as the
      trainee can practice the pertinent steps of the procedure using the same skills: 
      training on a well-designed low-fidelity model confers the same benefit as
      training on a high-fidelity model. Bench model training in ureteroscopy appears
      to have a durable effect on the clinical performance of surgical residents. More 
      research is necessary to validate training on bench models and may lead to more
      objective measures of surgical competency.

TI  - The impact of intersection design on simulated driving performance of young and
      senior adults.
PG  - 78-86
AB  - PURPOSE: The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) proposed guidelines for
      highway design to increase the safe driving ability of older drivers; however,
      little empirical evidence exists to support the effectiveness of these
      guidelines. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of
      implementing these guidelines (in 4 pairs of intersections) on safe driving
      performance of older and younger drivers using a high-fidelity driving simulator.
      DESIGN AND METHODS: We replicated four intersection pairs (improved versus
      unimproved) in a high-fidelity, virtual reality driving simulator. Simulator
      scenarios were created from actual road locations, replicating road geometrics
      and traffic control devices. The simulator's controls were integrated with an
      actual vehicle to make the driving experience as realistic as possible. Kinematic
      measures were obtained from the simulator in conjunction with driving errors
      recorded by trained driving evaluators sitting in the cab of the car. Thirty-nine
      subjects, 19 younger and 20 older adults, participated in the study. RESULTS: For
      the kinematic data we found greater lateral control, as indicated by
      significantly smaller maximum yaw during the turn phase, at all of the improved
      intersections when compared to the unimproved intersections. We found some
      significant age differences, but mostly in only one of the intersection-pairs.
      For the behavioral data, there were significant differences in driving errors
      between improved and unimproved intersections in two intersection-pairs; however,
      there were no significant differences in driving errors between the older and
      younger drivers. IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest that both young and older
      drivers may benefit from roadways with safety features recommended by the FHWA
      guidelines as indicated by the increased lateral control of the vehicle when
      negotiating these intersections. These findings generate critical information for
      those involved in the design of roadway systems.

TI  - Use of virtual reality simulator in the training of postgraduated surgical
      residents.
PG  - 465-8
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this research project, granted by the Italian
      University and Scientific Research Ministry (MIUR) and carried on among four
      Surgical Departments in Padua, Verona, Pisa and Rome-Tor Vergata Universities, is
      to study the effectiveness of a virtual reality simulator as a tool for surgical 
      residents training and as a method for measuring the surgical skills. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: The residents performances on the computer were compared with those 
      obtained by other training groups: medical students with no surgical background, 
      senior surgeons with experience in the laparoscopy field and non medical students
      with referred ability in videogames. The residents were also sent to a well
      certified live animal laboratory where they could perform a cholecystectomy in a 
      pig. Their operation was assessed by two independent observers using a new
      scoring methods for assessing the operative errors. RESULTS: Statistically
      significant differences among the groups could be seen only after several tasks
      sessions and in the more surgical specific tasks. The first data analysis shows a
      fair correlation between the residents rank positions after the training tasks on
      the simulator and those obtained in the surgical operation. CONCLUSION: Even if
      the data are not conclusive and the surgical simulators must develop greater
      levels of fidelity and operational diversity, the potential value of simulation
      in the educational surgical field appears to be impressive.

TI  - A haptic guidance tool for CT-directed percutaneous interventions.
PG  - 2746-9
AB  - We have developed a new navigation approach for computer-assisted interventional 
      radiology. Our system combines a virtual reality display with high-fidelity
      haptic rendering to provide assistance and guidance of the medical gesture.
      Specifically, the system is designed to improve the accuracy of blind needle
      placement within tissues. The proposed technique actively helps the surgeon while
      keeping him in control of the procedure. We have recently developed an
      experimental setup for CT-guided biopsy. The setup features a high-precision
      haptic device connected to the biopsy needle, combined with a graphical
      interface. The haptic system guides the surgeon's hand to the target tissue based
      on CT data, whereas a real-time, graphical visualization of the tool trajectory
      provides navigation information. The setup requires rigid registration of the
      patient with respect to the haptic interface. Tests have been performed in the
      presence of radiologists to validate the proposed concept, and early results show
      that the system is easy to use and requires little training. We are planning to
      conduct clinical testing in the near future to quantitatively assess system
      performance.

AB  - Developers of medical simulators and instructors who use them often have
      questions about the level of fidelity needed in a simulation. In this article, we
      address the nature of fidelity with respect to virtual reality training systems. 
      We argue that high-fidelity simulators do not always lead to better performance, 
      and in some instances, can interfere with performance. The primary reason for
      these seemingly counterintuitive findings lies with a fundamental understanding
      of how humans perceive and process sensory information. Consequently,
      simulation-based training systems should be developed to maximize their
      effectiveness, not their fidelity.

TI  - Training in carotid artery stenting: do carotid simulation systems really help?
PG  - 256-63
AB  - Virtual reality (VR) simulations have long been used for training in aviation and
      other professions. High-fidelity endovascular procedure simulators are now
      available, providing procedure simulations with real-time interactions;
      two-dimensional graphic displays of angiographic anatomy; mechanical interfaces
      with guidewires, sheaths, and catheters that provide some degree of haptic
      feedback; modeling of physiologic and pharmacology responses; and other features.
      Simulators have been incorporated into training programs for physicians learning 
      carotid artery stenting (CAS). For the first time, US Food and Drug
      Administration approval of a new device (CAS systems) has included a requirement 
      for physician training that incorporates the use of VR simulators. Early
      experience has shown that simulation is well accepted by trainees, performance on
      simulators improves with training and practice, and simulation prior to first
      performing endovascular procedures can improve clinical performance. Specific to 
      CAS, the value of education programs using simulators appears to be tangible as
      trained but inexperienced CAS operators have clinical results comparable to those
      of physicians with extensive CAS experience.

TI  - Virtual reality ureteroscopy simulator as a valid tool for assessing
      endourological skills.
PG  - 896-901
AB  - AIM: Virtual reality (VR) simulators are now commercially available for various
      surgical skills training. The Uro Mentor VR Ureteroscopy Simulator by Symbionix
      is one system that may revolutionize the way we assess and teach surgical
      residents. Surgical educators may no longer have to depend on the operating room 
      as the sole venue for teaching residents technical skills. We validated
      performance on this new system with previously developed assessment tools and
      compared it to performance on a high fidelity ureteroscopy bench model. METHODS: 
      Urology residents (n = 16) were assessed on their ability to perform cystoscopy, 
      guidewire insertion, semirigid ureteroscopy and basket extraction of a distal
      ureteric stone on the VR simulator. A blinded examiner assessed subject
      performance using a checklist, global rating scale and a pass/fail rating. In
      addition, computer-generated parameters including time to complete task, scope
      and instrument trauma and the number of attempts to insert a guidewire were
      analysed. Performance on the VR simulator was compared to performance on a high
      fidelity ureteroscopy bench model. RESULTS: Senior residents (n = 8) scored
      significantly higher on their global rating scale (29.4 +/- 2.5 vs 20.8 +/- 0.9, 
      P = 0.005), checklist (19.1 +/- 1.1 vs 15.2 +/- 0.9, P = 0.02), pass/fail rating 
      (chi(2) = 7.3, P = 0.007) and required less time to complete the task (352.9 +/- 
      55.7 s vs 576.8 +/- 67.4 s., P = 0.02) than the junior residents (n = 8) on the
      VR simulator. Junior residents also had a significantly higher incidence of scope
      trauma (4 vs 0.6, P = 0.02). No significant differences were noted in instrument 
      trauma and the number of attempts to insert the guidewire. Global rating scale
      performance on the VR simulator correlated well to performance on the high
      fidelity ureteroscopy bench model (r = 0.7, P = 0.002) as did time to complete
      task (r = 0.7, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The Uro Mentor VR Ureteroscopy Simulator 
      is a useful tool in assessing resident endourological skills. Performance on the 
      VR simulator is comparable to a validated high fidelity ureteroscopy bench model.
      Future studies will assess the utility of VR simulators in surgical skills
      training.

TI  - Tissue consistency perception in laparoscopy to define the level of fidelity in
      virtual reality simulation.
PG  - 1368-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: What degree of fidelity must a laparoscopic simulator have to achieve
      a training objective? This difficult question is addressed by studying the
      sensory interaction of surgeons in terms of a surgical skill: tissue consistency 
      perception. METHODS: A method for characterizing surgeon sensory interaction has 
      been defined and applied in an effort to determine the relative importance of
      three components of perceptual surgical skill: visual cues, haptic information,
      and previous surgical knowledge and experience. Expert, intermediate, and novel
      surgeons were enrolled in the study. Users were asked to rank tissue consistency 
      in four different conditions: a description of the tissue alone (Q), visual
      information alone (VI), tactile information alone (TI), and both visual and
      tactile information (VTI). Agreement between these stages was assessed by a
      coefficient of determination (R2). RESULTS: Tissue is a determinant factor (p <
      0.001) in the perception of tissue consistency, whereas the expertise of the
      surgeon is not (p = 0.289). Tissue consistency perception is based mainly on
      tactile information (TI-VTI agreement is high, R2 = 0.873), although little
      sensory substitution is present (VI-VTI agreement is low, R2 = 0.509). Agreement 
      of Q-VI increases with experience (R2 = 0.050, 0.290, and 0.573, corresponding
      with to novel, intermediate, and expert surgeons), which has been associated with
      the "visual haptics" concept. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality simulators need haptic
      devices with force feedback capability if tissue consistency information is to be
      delivered. On the other hand, the visual haptics concept has been associated with
      a kind of tactile memory developed by surgical experience.

TI  - Control of laparoscopic instrument motion in an inanimate bench model:
      implications for the training and the evaluation of technical skills.
PG  - 123-32
AB  - Computer-assisted analysis of wrist movement has recently emerged as an objective
      laparoscopic performance evaluation method. The first purpose of this study was
      to assess the differences in motion characteristics between the tip of the
      instrument and the wrist. The second purpose was to describe the control
      strategies used to move laparoscopic instruments. During a bead transfer task,
      motions of a laparoscopic needle driver's tip, heel, and the participants' wrist 
      were monitored. Results showed that large amplitude movements were best described
      by movements of the wrist, and small amplitude movements were evidenced by
      motions of the instrument tip. Thus, for describing expertise, and for evaluation
      and feedback, motion of the tip of the laparoscopic instrument should be
      quantified, in addition to motion of the wrist. The motions of the instrument
      were controlled by utilizing the flexibility of the skin of the laparoscopic
      trainer in addition to using the fulcrum, and sliding through the trocar. In
      order to increase fidelity, virtual reality trainers should simulate the
      flexibility of the real structures around the insertion of the instrument.

TI  - Tumor growth models to generate pathologies for surgical training simulators.
PG  - 305-16
AB  - Many virtual reality based surgical training simulators have been presented in
      the last few years. These systems promise to alleviate the lack of realistic
      training possibilities common to minimally invasive procedures. Virtual reality
      allows for riskless training on a wide range of findings in a condensed period of
      time. We investigated different methods for the generation of tumor models
      suitable for surgical training simulators. The goal of our research is a high
      fidelity hysteroscopy simulator which provides an individual surgical scene for
      every training. Emphasis was placed on the modeling of growth processes leading
      to the generation of macroscopically realistic findings of the most common
      pathologies in hysteroscopy, namely polyps and myomas found in the uterine
      cavity. Both a cellular automaton and a particle based tumor growth model are
      presented and discussed.

PG  - 503-5
AB  - Laparoscopic training, under simulated settings, benefits from high fidelity
      models of the actual environment. This study was aimed at reducing uncertainty in
      the displacement and loads experienced by a laparoscopic instrument during
      surgical training. Infrared tracking of laparoscopic instruments is ineffective
      when real tissues attenuate the infrared signals. Incorporating the use of strain
      gauges for tip deflection measurements allows for online motion and load tracking
      during a procedure. Strain gauge voltages and infrared markers indicating
      displacement were both linear with respect to loads up to 700 grams. The
      resultant strain gauge voltage was equated to deflection values with a
      calibration constant. The results serve two purposes. First, it may enable the
      tracking and analysis of the skill level of novice surgeons using bench models.
      Second, the mechanical model of each instrument can be quantified and
      incorporated into virtual simulations, thus increasing model fidelity,
      effectively leading to better learning.

TI  - Image-guided laser projection for port placement in minimally invasive surgery.
PG  - 367-72
AB  - We present an application of an augmented reality laser projection system in
      which procedure-specific optimal incision sites, computed from pre-operative
      image acquisition, are superimposed on a patient to guide port placement in
      minimally invasive surgery. Tests were conducted to evaluate the fidelity of
      computed and measured port configurations, and to validate the accuracy with
      which a surgical tool-tip can be placed at an identified virtual target. A high
      resolution volumetric image of a thorax phantom was acquired using helical
      computed tomography imaging. Oriented within the thorax, a phantom organ with
      marked targets was visualized in a virtual environment. A graphical interface
      enabled marking the locations of target anatomy, and calculation of a grid of
      potential port locations along the intercostal rib lines. Optimal configurations 
      of port positions and tool orientations were determined by an objective measure
      reflecting image-based indices of surgical dexterity, hand-eye alignment, and
      collision detection. Intra-operative registration of the computed virtual model
      and the phantom anatomy was performed using an optical tracking system. Initial
      trials demonstrated that computed and projected port placement provided direct
      access to target anatomy with an accuracy of 2 mm.

TI  - Study of laparoscopic forces perception for defining simulation fidelity.
PG  - 288-92
AB  - One of the most controversial dilemmas in virtual reality laparoscopic simulators
      design is the incorporation of force feedback (FF). This issue is approached with
      an experimental design in which surgeons assess the resistance against pulling of
      four different tissues, which are characterized with the acquisition of
      interaction forces. Comparing subjective assessments with objective force
      parameters we aim to determine the fidelity boundary beyond which no more realism
      is necessary in simulation. Interaction pulling forces of four tissues have been 
      characterized, which can constitute a basis for requirements of a FF algorithm.
      Results have also led to the hypothesis that surgeons are able to differentiate
      tissues and perceive somesthesic information although resulting interaction
      forces are of the same magnitude than interferences like trocar friction.

TI  - Use of surgical videos for realistic simulation of surgical procedures.
PG  - 234-9
AB  - One of the major challenges in the development of virtual environments for
      medical simulations is photorealistic rendering, permitting high fidelity visual 
      effects and user interaction. Digitized videos recorded from the laparoscopic
      camera are a rich source of information about surgical scenarios. How to fully
      utilize the information is important for improving the realism of the simulated
      scenarios. In reality, the camera viewpoint changes frequently and even for the
      same viewpoint, the scene is dynamic due to rhythmic heartbeat. Hence, the
      results of classical texture mapping are usually visually unappealing as they
      fail to capture the pulsatile effect, as well as other global illumination

PG  - 63-73
AB  - Observable objects in biology and medicine extend across a range of scale, from
      individual molecules and cells; through the varieties of tissue and interstitial 
      interfaces; and to complete organs, organ systems, and body parts. These objects 
      include functional attributes of these systems such as biophysical,
      biomechanical, and physiologic properties. Imaging in three dimensions of such
      objects and their functions is possible now with the advent of high-resolution
      tomographic scanners and imaging systems. Medical applications include accurate
      anatomy and function mapping, enhanced diagnosis, accurate treatment planning and
      rehearsal, and education and training. Biologic applications include study and
      analysis of structure-to-function relationships in individual cells and
      organelles. The potential for revolutionary innovation in the practice of
      medicine and in biologic investigations lies in direct, fully immersive,
      real-time multisensory fusion of real and virtual information data streams into
      online, real-time images available during actual clinical procedures or biologic 
      experiments. Current high-performance computing, advanced image processing and
      high-fidelity rendering capabilities have facilitated major progress toward
      realization of these goals. With these advances in hand, there are several
      important applications of three-dimensional viewing that will have a substantial 
      impact on the practice of medicine.

TI  - Virtual-reality-based laparoscopic surgical training: the role of simulation
      fidelity in haptic feedback.
PG  - 227-34
AB  - Although there have been significant advances in the development of
      virtual-reality-based surgical simulations, there remain fundamental questions
      concerning the fidelity required for effective surgical training. A dual-station 
      experimental platform was built for the purpose of investigating these fidelity
      requirements. Analogous laparoscopic surgical tasks were implemented on a virtual
      station and a real station, with the virtual station modeling the real
      environment with various degrees of fidelity. After measuring the subjects'
      initial performance on the real station, different groups of subjects were
      trained on the virtual station under a variety of conditions and finally tested
      on the real station. Experiments involved bimanual pushing and cutting tasks on a
      nonlinear elastic object. The results showed that force feedback results in
      significantly improved training transfer as compared to training without force
      feedback. The training effectiveness of a linear approximation model was
      approximately the same as that of a more accurate nonlinear model.

TI  - Height effects in real and virtual environments.
PG  - 430-8
AB  - The study compared human perceptions of height, danger, and anxiety, as well as
      skin conductance and heart rate responses and postural instability effects, in
      real and virtual height environments. The 24 participants (12 men, 12 women),
      whose average age was 23.6 years, performed "lean-over-the-railing" and standing 
      tasks on real and comparable virtual balconies, using a surround-screen virtual
      reality (SSVR) system. The results indicate that the virtual display of elevation
      provided realistic perceptual experience and induced some physiological responses
      and postural instability effects comparable to those found in a real environment.
      It appears that a simulation of elevated work environment in a SSVR system,
      although with reduced visual fidelity, is a valid tool for safety research.
      Potential applications of this study include the design of virtual environments
      that will help in safe evaluation of human performance at elevation,
      identification of risk factors leading to fall incidents, and assessment of new
      fall prevention strategies.

TI  - User interface paradigms for patient-specific surgical planning: lessons learned 
      over a decade of research.
PG  - 203-22
AB  - This paper covers work in virtual reality-based, patient-specific surgical
      planning over the past decade. It aims to comprehensively examine the user
      interface paradigms and system designs during that period of time and to
      objectively analyze their effectiveness for the task. The goal is to provide
      useful feedback on these interface and implementation paradigms to aid other
      researchers in this field. First, specialized systems for specific clinical use
      were produced with a limited set of visualization tools. Later, through
      collaboration with NASA, an immersive virtual environment was created to produce 
      high-fidelity images for surgical simulation, but it underestimated the
      importance of collaboration. The next system, a networked, distributed virtual
      environment, provided immersion and collaboration, but the immersive paradigm was
      found to be of a disadvantage and the uniqueness of the framework unwieldy. A
      virtual model, workbench-style display was then created using a commercial
      package, but limitations of each were soon apparent. Finally, a specialized
      display, with an integrated visualization and simulation system is described and 
      evaluated. Lessons learned include: surgical planning is an abstract process
      unlike surgical simulation; collaboration is important, as is stereo
      visualization; and that high-resolution preoperative images from standard
      viewpoints are desirable, but interaction is truly the key to planning.

TI  - Structural flexibility of laparoscopic instruments: implication for the design of
      virtual reality simulators.
PG  - 201-3
AB  - In accordance with the Practice Specificity Theory, training on models that
      closely resemble real life scenarios is most beneficial to learning. Research in 
      the virtual reality (VR) simulation, as a potential teaching and evaluation tool,
      concentrated on the design of trainers to resemble operating room (OR)
      conditions. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the
      structural flexibility of laparoscopic instruments of different materials and
      diameters under a wide range of stresses. Incorporating the mechanical properties
      of these instruments into the algorithms can prove to further increase the
      fidelity of VR simulators. The amount of deviation from pre-stress position in
      the instruments' shaft was measured with infrared markers and used as the index
      of structural flexibility. All instruments deviated considerably with the largest
      deviations observed for the small disposable, and lowest for the large reusable
      instruments. There was a linear relation between the stress and deviation for all
      instruments, which varied as a function of diameter. Similar instrument
      deviations were observed during cholecystectomy performed on porcine liver. Our
      findings show that laparoscopic instruments are not rigid bodies and are prone to
      significant deviations during standard laparoscopic procedures. This suggests
      that the structural flexibility of laparoscopic instruments should be modeled in 
      the design of VR simulators.

TI  - Control of laparoscopic instrument motion in an inanimate bench model:
      implications for the training and evaluation of technical skills.
PG  - 149-52
AB  - Laparoscopic surgery requires new methods of technical competency evaluation, as 
      well as training. The first purpose was to assess the differences in motion
      characteristics between the tip of the instrument and the wrist. The second
      purpose was to determine whether similar control strategies are used to move
      instruments in virtual reality and bench model environments. Surgically naive
      participants were required to tap a laparoscopic instrument between two targets
      that differed in size and separation distance. Large amplitude movements were
      controlled with the movements of the wrist and small amplitude with the wrist and
      the fingers (p<.001). Participants utilized the flexibility of the skin of the
      laparoscopic trainer to facilitate their movements. These results suggest that
      monitoring the motions of the instrument tip is a more precise indication of its 
      motions than are motions of the wrist when movements of small amplitudes are
      produced. Moreover, in order to increase fidelity, VR trainers should simulate
      the flexibility of the real structures around the insertion of the instrument.

TI  - Virtual reality simulation for the operating room: proficiency-based training as 
      a paradigm shift in surgical skills training.
PG  - 364-72
AB  - SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: To inform surgeons about the practical issues to be
      considered for successful integration of virtual reality simulation into a
      surgical training program. The learning and practice of minimally invasive
      surgery (MIS) makes unique demands on surgical training programs. A decade ago
      Satava proposed virtual reality (VR) surgical simulation as a solution for this
      problem. Only recently have robust scientific studies supported that vision
      METHODS: A review of the surgical education, human-factor, and psychology
      literature to identify important factors which will impinge on the successful
      integration of VR training into a surgical training program. RESULTS: VR is more 
      likely to be successful if it is systematically integrated into a
      well-thought-out education and training program which objectively assesses
      technical skills improvement proximate to the learning experience. Validated
      performance metrics should be relevant to the surgical task being trained but in 
      general will require trainees to reach an objectively determined proficiency
      criterion, based on tightly defined metrics and perform at this level
      consistently. VR training is more likely to be successful if the training
      schedule takes place on an interval basis rather than massed into a short period 
      of extensive practice. High-fidelity VR simulations will confer the greatest
      skills transfer to the in vivo surgical situation, but less expensive VR trainers
      will also lead to considerably improved skills generalizations. CONCLUSIONS: VR
      for improved performance of MIS is now a reality. However, VR is only a training 
      tool that must be thoughtfully introduced into a surgical training curriculum for
      it to successfully improve surgical technical skills.

PG  - 154-6
AB  - A high fidelity Virtual Human Interface (VHI) system was developed using low-cost
      and portable computers. The system features real-time photo-realistic digital
      replicas of multiple individuals capable of talking, acting and showing emotions 
      and over 60 different facial expressions. These virtual patients appear in a
      high-performance virtual reality environment featuring full panoramic
      backgrounds, animated 3D objects, behavior and AI models, a complete vision
      system for supporting interaction and advanced animation interfaces. The VHI
      takes advantage of the latest advances in computer graphics. As such, it allows
      medical researchers and practitioners to create real-time responsive virtual
      humans for their experiments using computer systems priced under $2000.

TI  - See one, do one, teach one: advanced technology in medical education.
PG  - 1149-54
AB  - The concept of "learning by doing" has become less acceptable, particularly when 
      invasive procedures and high-risk care are required. Restrictions on medical
      educators have prompted them to seek alternative methods to teach medical
      knowledge and gain procedural experience. Fortunately, the last decade has seen
      an explosion of the number of tools available to enhance medical education:
      web-based education, virtual reality, and high fidelity patient simulation. This 
      paper presents some of the consensus statements in regard to these tools agreed
      upon by members of the Educational Technology Section of the 2004 AEM Consensus
      Conference for Informatics and Technology in Emergency Department Health Care,
      held in Orlando, Florida. FINDINGS: Web-based teaching: 1) Every ED should have
      access to medical educational materials via the Internet, computer-based
      training, and other effective education methods for point-of-service information,
      continuing medical education, and training. 2) Real-time automated tools should
      be integrated into Emergency Department Information Systems [EDIS] for
      contemporaneous education. Virtual reality [VR]: 1) Emergency physicians and
      emergency medicine societies should become more involved in VR development and
      assessment. 2) Nationally accepted protocols for the proper assessment of VR
      applications should be adopted and large multi-center groups should be formed to 
      perform these studies. High-fidelity simulation: Emergency medicine residency
      programs should consider the use of high-fidelity patient simulators to enhance
      the teaching and evaluation of core competencies among trainees. CONCLUSIONS:
      Across specialties, patient simulation, virtual reality, and the Web will soon
      enable medical students and residents to... see one, simulate many, do one
      competently, and teach everyone.

TI  - Virtual reality training for the operating room and cardiac catheterisation
      laboratory.
PG  - 1538-40
AB  - CONTEXT: High-profile cases of medical errors in the USA and UK, and major
      reports from organisations such as the US Institute of Medicine and UK Senate of 
      Surgery, have sensitised the public and medical profession. Training is a key
      area that must be tackled to positively affect the problem of medical errors,
      especially in surgery and interventional cardiology. Despite the radically novel 
      skills required for minimally invasive surgery or interventional cardiology,
      current training has gone largely unchanged. At the end of the 20th century, the 
      public and the medical profession have concluded that training on patients is no 
      longer acceptable. STARTING POINT: Recently, Teodor Grantcharov and colleagues
      (Br J Surg 2004; 91: 146-50) did a randomised double-blind trial which showed
      that training by virtual reality (VR) significantly reduces objectively assessed 
      intraoperative errors in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. They used a low-fidelity
      VR simulator. Much more sophisticated VR simulators exist for endoscopy,
      gynaecology, laparoscopy, orthopaedics, otolaryngology, robotics, and urology.
      There are few studies on the efficacy of these simulators in improving the safety
      of procedures on patients. WHERE NEXT: There needs to be more large and
      multicentre studies. Technical skills training for procedural based medicine
      continues to be an ad-hoc mentor-based experience for the trainee, with
      experience gained by practising on patients. The skills required now are so
      difficult to learn that this type of training is no longer acceptable.
      VR-simulator-based training does work, but further empirical evidence is required
      to convince the more conservative members of the medical community.

TI  - A part-task approach to haptic knee arthroscopy training.
PG  - 216-8
AB  - This paper describes the research behind a part-task approach to both the
      development of, and the training offered, by a virtual reality simulator for knee
      arthroscopy. An ethnographic approach has been taken to examine the nature of
      task performance and the current training of the arthroscopic diagnosis of the
      knee. This Human Factors research is used to support the development of WISHKATS.
      The design addresses the challenge of technically producing haptic feedback for a
      knee surgery simulator whilst offering sufficient fidelity to train the necessary
      skills and conform to traditional surgical training.

TI  - Developing a virtual reality-based methodology for people with dementia: a
      feasibility study.
PG  - 591-611
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of virtual reality (VR)
      technology for use by persons with dementia (PWD). Data were obtained directly
      from six PWD regarding their experiences with a virtual environment (VE) of a
      large outdoor park. A user-centered method was developed to assess: (a) presence;
      (b) user inputs; (c) display quality; (d) simulation fidelity; and (e) overall
      system usability. The extent to which PWD could perform four functional
      activities in the VE was also investigated (e.g., mailing a letter). In addition,
      physical and psychological well-being of PWD while interacting with the VE was
      assessed objectively by recording heart rate during the VR sessions and
      subjectively with discrete questionnaire items and real-time prompts. Symptom
      profiles associated with simulator sickness were assessed with an adapted version
      of the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire. The study found that PWD to some extent 
      experienced presence; perceived that objects were realistic and moved naturally; 
      generally felt in control of the interaction; and demonstrated little difficulty 
      using a joystick for navigation. The study also demonstrated that VR is an
      appropriate medium for assessing functional behavior within the context of an
      ecologically valid VE. PWD did not experience any significant increase in
      symptoms associated with simulator sickness, or detriments to their psychological
      and physical well-being. These findings demonstrated that it is feasible to work 
      in VEs with PWD.

TI  - Virtual reality applications in clinical medicine.
PG  - 211-5
AB  - Virtual reality, the use of computational methods to present users with a
      multimedia environment that simulates reality, is becoming a practical,
      affordable technology for the teaching and practice of clinical medicine.
      Although limited-fidelity virtual reality systems have been used in medical
      education for decades, modern, high-fidelity virtual reality systems have
      practical applications in areas ranging from psychiatry to surgical planning and 
      telemedicine. Factors that limit widespread use of virtual reality in medicine
      include a lack of standards for the re-purposing and sharing of system components
      and the resultant low return on investment from custom systems. The standards
      issue is being addressed by economic incentives from organizations such as the
      U.S. military, which requires computer-based educational materials, including
      simulations, to be interoperable. Similarly, the low return on investment is
      becoming less of a factor in clinical scenarios in which virtual reality systems 
      offer physicians and their patients experiences that are impossible or
      impractical to gain elsewhere.

TI  - Training and educational approaches to minimally invasive surgery: state of the
      art.
PG  - 198-205
AB  - Current training in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is inadequate given the
      demands of patients on practitioners and the number of surgeons and residents who
      still need to be trained. The training that is provided is neither widespread nor
      is it standardized, resulting in graduate surgeons with a wide range of
      competence. There is little guidance in what a training program needs to be
      effective. We provide a brief review of the state of the art of MIS training with
      some emphasis given to training methods including perceptual motor training, MIS 
      learning laboratories, virtual reality, evaluation and assessment, cost,
      simulation fidelity, credentialing, certification, privileging, and ergonomics.
      We conclude that the state of the art is left wanting.

TI  - Virtual reality simulators: current status in acquisition and assessment of
      surgical skills.
PG  - 30-4
AB  - Medical technology is currently evolving so rapidly that its impact cannot be
      analysed. Robotics and telesurgery loom on the horizon, and the technology used
      to drive these advances has serendipitous side-effects for the education and
      training arena. The graphical and haptic interfaces used to provide remote
      feedback to the operator--by passing control to a computer--may be used to
      generate simulations of the operative environment that are useful for training
      candidates in surgical procedures. One additional advantage is that the metrics
      calculated inherently in the controlling software in order to run the simulation 
      may be used to provide performance feedback to individual trainees and mentors.
      New interfaces will be required to undergo evaluation of the simulation fidelity 
      before being deemed acceptable. The potential benefits fall into one of two
      general categories: those benefits related to skill acquisition, and those
      related to skill assessment. The educational value of the simulation will require
      assessment, and comparison to currently available methods of training in any
      given procedure. It is also necessary to determine--by repeated trials--whether a
      given simulation actually measures the performance parameters it purports to
      measure. This trains the spotlight on what constitutes good surgical skill, and
      how it is to be objectively measured. Early results suggest that virtual reality 
      simulators have an important role to play in this aspect of surgical training.

TI  - The effects of levels of immersion on memory and presence in virtual
      environments: a reality centered approach.
PG  - 247-64
AB  - Simulation fidelity is characterized as the extent to which a Virtual Environment
      (VE) and relevant interactions with it are indistinguishable from a user's
      interaction with a real environment. The growing number of VE training
      applications which target a high level of simulation fidelity, mainly for
      transfer of training in the real world, have made it crucial to examine the
      manner in which these particular implementations and designs are evaluated. The
      methodology presented in this study focuses on real versus simulated virtual
      worlds, comparing participants' level of presence, task performance, and
      cognition state employed to complete a memory task. A 15-minute seminar was
      presented in four different conditions including real, 3D desktop, 3D Head
      Mounted Display (HMD) and Audio-only (between-subjects design). Four independent 
      groups of 18 participants took part in the experiment, which investigated the
      effects of levels of immersion on participants' memory recall and memory
      awareness state (relevant to episodic and semantic memory types) as well as on
      their perception of the experimental space and sense of presence for every
      condition. The level of reported presence was not positively associated with
      accurate memory recall in all conditions, although the scores for both presence
      and seminar memory recall in the "real" condition were statistically higher.
      Memory awareness states' analysis gave a invaluable insight into "how"
      participants remembered both communicated information and space, as opposed to
      "what," most interestingly across specific conditions where results for presence 
      and accurate memory recall were not proven to be significant.

TI  - Performance-driven facial animation: basic research on human judgments of
      emotional state in facial avatars.
PG  - 471-87
AB  - Virtual reality is rapidly evolving into a pragmatically usable technology for
      mental health (MH) applications. As the underlying enabling technologies continue
      to evolve and allow us to design more useful and usable structural virtual
      environments (VEs), the next important challenge will involve populating these
      environments with virtual representations of humans (avatars). This will be vital
      to create mental health VEs that leverage the use of avatars for applications
      that require human-human interaction and communication. As Alessi et al.1 pointed
      out at the 8th Annual Medicine Meets Virtual Reality Conference (MMVR8), virtual 
      humans have mainly appeared in MH applications to "serve the role of props,
      rather than humans." More believable avatars inhabiting VEs would open up
      possibilities for MH applications that address social interaction, communication,
      instruction, assessment, and rehabilitation issues. They could also serve to
      enhance realism that might in turn promote the experience of presence in VR.
      Additionally, it will soon be possible to use computer-generated avatars that
      serve to provide believable dynamic facial and bodily representations of
      individuals communicating from a distance in real time. This could support the
      delivery, in shared virtual environments, of more natural human interaction
      styles, similar to what is used in real life between people. These techniques
      could enhance communication and interaction by leveraging our natural sensing and
      perceiving capabilities and offer the potential to model human-computer-human
      interaction after human-human interaction. To enhance the authenticity of virtual
      human representations, advances in the rendering of facial and gestural behaviors
      that support implicit communication will be needed. In this regard, the current
      paper presents data from a study that compared human raters' judgments of
      emotional expression between actual video clips of facial expressions and
      identical expressions rendered on a three-dimensional avatar using a
      performance-driven facial animation (PDFA) system developed at the University of 
      Southern California Integrated Media Systems Center. PDFA offers a means for
      creating high-fidelity visual representations of human faces and bodies. This
      effort explores the feasibility of sensing and reproducing a range of facial
      expressions with a PDFA system. In order to test concordance of human ratings of 
      emotional expression between video and avatar facial delivery, we first had
      facial model subjects observe stimuli that were designed to elicit naturalistic
      facial expressions. The emotional stimulus induction involved presenting
      text-based, still image, and video clips to subjects that were previously rated
      to induce facial expressions for the six universals2 of facial expression (happy,
      sad, fear, anger, disgust, and surprise), in addition to attentiveness,
      puzzlement and frustration. Videotapes of these induced facial expressions that
      best represented prototypic examples of the above emotional states and
      three-dimensional avatar animations of the same facial expressions were randomly 
      presented to 38 human raters. The raters used open-end, forced choice and
      seven-point Likert-type scales to rate expression in terms of identification. The
      forced choice and seven-point ratings provided the most usable data to determine 
      video/animation concordance and these data are presented. To support a clear
      understanding of this data, a website has been set up that will allow readers to 
      view the video and facial animation clips to illustrate the assets and
      limitations of these types of facial expression-rendering methods (www.
      USCAvatars.com/MMVR). This methodological first step in our research program has 
      served to provide valuable human user-centered feedback to support the iterative 
      design and development of facial avatar characteristics for expression of
      emotional communication.

TI  - A virtual reality patient simulation system for teaching emergency response
      skills to U.S. Navy medical providers.
PG  - 3-8
AB  - Rapid and effective medical intervention in response to civil and
      military-related disasters is crucial for saving lives and limiting long-term
      disability. Inexperienced providers may suffer in performance when faced with
      limited supplies and the demands of stabilizing casualties not generally
      encountered in the comparatively resource-rich hospital setting. Head trauma and 
      multiple injury cases are particularly complex to diagnose and treat, requiring
      the integration and processing of complex multimodal data. In this project,
      collaborators adapted and merged existing technologies to produce a flexible,
      modular patient simulation system with both three-dimensional virtual reality and
      two-dimensional flat screen user interfaces for teaching cognitive assessment and
      treatment skills. This experiential, problem-based training approach engages the 
      user in a stress-filled, high fidelity world, providing multiple learning
      opportunities within a compressed period of time and without risk. The system
      simulates both the dynamic state of the patient and the results of user
      intervention, enabling trainees to watch the virtual patient deteriorate or
      stabilize as a result of their decision-making speed and accuracy. Systems can be
      deployed to the field enabling trainees to practice repeatedly until their skills
      are mastered and to maintain those skills once acquired. This paper describes the
      technologies and the process used to develop the trainers, the clinical
      algorithms, and the incorporation of teaching points. We also characterize
      aspects of the actual simulation exercise through the lens of the trainee.

TI  - Accomplishments and challenges of surgical simulation.
PG  - 232-41
AB  - For nearly a decade, advanced computer technologies have created extraordinary
      educational tools using three-dimensional (3D) visualization and virtual reality.
      Pioneering efforts in surgical simulation with these tools have resulted in a
      first generation of simulators for surgical technical skills. Accomplishments
      include simulations with 3D models of anatomy for practice of surgical tasks,
      initial assessment of student performance in technical skills, and awareness by
      professional societies of potential in surgical education and certification.
      However, enormous challenges remain, which include improvement of technical
      fidelity, standardization of accurate metrics for performance evaluation,
      integration of simulators into a robust educational curriculum, stringent
      evaluation of simulators for effectiveness and value added to surgical training, 
      determination of simulation application to certification of surgical technical
      skills, and a business model to implement and disseminate simulation successfully
      throughout the medical education community. This review looks at the historical
      progress of surgical simulators, their accomplishments, and the challenges that
      remain.

TI  - Military medical modeling and simulation in the 21st century.
PG  - 322-8
AB  - As we enter the 21st century, military medicine struggles with critical issues.
      One of the most important issues is how to train medical personnel in peace for
      the realities of war. In April, 1998, The General Accounting Office (GAO)
      reported, "Military medical personnel have almost no chance during peacetime to
      practice battlefield trauma care skills. As a result, physicians both within and 
      outside the Department of Defense (DOD) believe that military medical personnel
      are not prepared to provide trauma care to the severely injured soldiers in
      wartime. With some of today's training methods disappearing, the challenge of
      providing both initial; and sustainment training for almost 100,000 military
      medical personnel is becoming insurmountable. The "training gap" is huge and
      impediments to training are mounting. For example, restrictions on animal use are
      increasing and the cost of conducting live mass casualty exercises is
      prohibitive. Many medical simulation visionaries believe that four categories of 
      medical simulation are emerging to address these challenges. These categories
      include PC-based multimedia, digital mannequins, virtual workbenches, and total
      immersion virtual reality (TIVR). The use of simulation training can provide a
      risk = free realistic learning environment for the spectrum of medical skills
      training, from buddy-aid to trauma surgery procedures. This will, in turn,
      enhance limited hands on training opportunities and revolutionize the way we
      train in peace to deliver medicine in war. High-fidelity modeling will permit
      manufacturers to prototype new devices before manufacture. Also, engineers will
      be able to test a device for themselves in a variety of simulated anatomical
      representations, permitting them to "practice medicine".

AB  - Changes in medical practice that limit patient availability and instructors' time
      have resulted in poor physical diagnosis skills by learners at all levels.
      Advanced simulation technology, including the use of sophisticated multimedia
      computer systems, helps to address this problem. For many years 'Harvey', the
      Cardiology Patient Simulator, and the UMedic Multimedia Computer system have
      proven to be effective tools to teach and assess bedside cardiovascular skills
      when they are integrated into the required curriculum of medical school and
      postgraduate training. In the future, virtual reality technology, based initially
      on data from the Visible Human Data set, will provide the majority of
      simulation-based training. Models that provide a high level of visual fidelity
      and use sophisticated haptic devices that simulate the 'touch' and 'feel' of a
      procedure or examination are now being used in selected medical centers. The
      presence of these tools is not enough. Evidence-based outcomes must show these
      systems to be effective instruments for teaching and assessment, and medical
      educators must be willing to effect change in medical education to ensure the
      appropriate use of these systems in the next millennium.

TI  - Radiological tele-immersion for next generation networks.
PG  - 4-9
AB  - Since the acquisition of high-resolution three-dimensional patient images has
      become widespread, medical volumetric datasets (CT or MR) larger than 100 MB and 
      encompassing more than 250 slices are common. It is important to make this
      patient-specific data quickly available and usable to many specialists at
      different geographical sites. Web-based systems have been developed to provide
      volume or surface rendering of medical data over networks with low fidelity, but 
      these cannot adequately handle stereoscopic visualization or huge datasets.
      State-of-the-art virtual reality techniques and high speed networks have made it 
      possible to create an environment for clinicians geographically distributed to
      immersively share these massive datasets in real-time. An object-oriented method 
      for instantaneously importing medical volumetric data into Tele-Immersive
      environments has been developed at the Virtual Reality in Medicine Laboratory
      (VRMedLab) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). This networked-VR
      setup is based on LIMBO, an application framework or template that provides the
      basic capabilities of Tele-Immersion. We have developed a modular general purpose
      Tele-Immersion program that automatically combines 3D medical data with the
      methods for handling the data. For this purpose a DICOM loader for IRIS Performer
      has been developed. The loader was designed for SGI machines as a shared object, 
      which is executed at LIMBO's runtime. The loader loads not only the selected
      DICOM dataset, but also methods for rendering, handling, and interacting with the
      data, bringing networked, real-time, stereoscopic interaction with radiological
      data to reality. Collaborative, interactive methods currently implemented in the 
      loader include cutting planes and windowing. The Tele-Immersive environment has
      been tested on the UIC campus over an ATM network. We tested the environment with
      3 nodes; one ImmersaDesk at the VRMedLab, one CAVE at the Electronic
      Visualization Laboratory (EVL) on east campus, and a CT scan machine in UIC
      Hospital. CT data was pulled directly from the scan machine to the Tele-Immersion
      server in our Laboratory, and then the data was synchronously distributed by our 
      Onyx2 Rack server to all the VR setups. Instead of permitting medical volume
      visualization at one VR device, by combining teleconferencing, tele-presence, and
      virtual reality, the Tele-Immersive environment will enable geographically
      distributed clinicians to intuitively interact with the same medical volumetric
      models, point, gesture, converse, and see each other. This environment will bring
      together clinicians at different geographic locations to participate in
      Tele-Immersive consultation and collaboration.

TI  - Virtual reality and women's health: a breast biopsy system.
PG  - 367-72
AB  - Minimally invasive procedures are becoming much more common in surgical practice 
      because of the many advantages for patient comfort and convenience, and improved 
      surgical access. However some of the major problems leading to occasional
      surgical errors with this minimal access method are restricted vision, limited
      sense of touch, difficulties in identification in 3D space of the position of the
      instrument tips, and their handling during delicate, short-distance movements
      toward the surgical target area. These factors emphasize the need for computer
      simulated training in surgical manipulations and procedures in preparation for
      conducting them in patients. The key new feature of our proof-of-concept training
      simulator is a preventive mechanism that serves at least two functions. As the
      surgical target (or a critical structure) is approached, a haptically generated
      preventive force forewarns the surgeon, making it possible to abort those
      maneuvers that may lead to adverse results. By announcing a potential collision
      of a virtual instrument tip with a surgical target, the time used for searching
      for the target is shortened, and the haptic signal minimizes the potential of
      tissue damage. This real-time, interactive, virtual reality based, haptic breast 
      biopsy-training simulation is a PC/NT based multitasking, multithreading system. 
      It is based upon an advanced force feedback device. The system monitors and
      indirectly guides the surgeon's movements, while providing high fidelity visual
      and force feedback cues as the area of surgical interest is approached. Our first
      application is with human breast.

TI  - Design of a virtual reality laboratory for interdisciplinary medical application.
PG  - 1051-5
AB  - The Department of Medical Informatics of the University of Goettingen sets up a
      medical interdisciplinary Virtual Reality (VR) laboratory. The interdisciplinary 
      approach for the design of the laboratory is based on a systematic, technical and
      application-orientated analysis. Its result led to the decision for a CAVE-like
      multi wall stereo projection (MWSP) system with networked workstation hardware.
      Within the boundary of an exemplary evaluation of the laboratory, its technical
      specifications and the validity in neuropsychological tests are supposed to be
      improved. Both techniques, Head Mounted Display (HMD) as well as multi wall
      stereo projection (MWSP) systems have a high degree of immersion. MWSP systems
      have a lower ratio of simulator sickness and a good visual fidelity. They can
      also be used as a multi-user environment. Networked workstations and
      high-end-computers are compared in view of their costs and possible
      expansibility.

TI  - Functional endoscopic sinus surgery training simulator.
PG  - 1643-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: To determine the efficacy of a haptic (force feedback)
      device and to compare isosurface and volumetric models of a functional endoscopic
      sinus surgery (FESS) training simulator. STUDY DESIGN: A pilot study involving
      faculty and residents from the Department of Otolaryngology at The Ohio State
      University. METHODS: Objective trials evaluated the haptic device's ability to
      perceive three-dimensional shapes (stereognosis) without the aid of image
      visualization. Ethmoidectomy tasks were performed with both isosurface and
      volumetric FESS simulators, and surveys compared the two models. RESULTS: The
      haptic device was 77% effective for stereognosis tasks. There was a preference
      toward the isosurface model over the volumetric model in terms of visual
      representation, comfort, haptic-visual fidelity, and overall performance.
      CONCLUSIONS: The FESS simulator uses both visual and haptic feedback to create a 
      virtual reality environment to teach paranasal sinus anatomy and basic endoscopic
      sinus surgery techniques to ear, nose, and throat residents. The results of the
      current study showed that the haptic device was accurate in and of itself, within
      its current physical limitations, and that the isosurface-based simulator was
      preferred.

AB  - Surgical simulation increasingly appears to be an essential aspect of tomorrow's 
      surgery. The development of a hepatic surgery simulator is an advanced concept
      calling for a new writing system which will transform the medical world: virtual 
      reality. Virtual reality extends the perception of our five senses by
      representing more than the real state of things by the means of computer sciences
      and robotics. It consists of three concepts: immersion, navigation and
      interaction. Three reasons have led us to develop this simulator: the first is to
      provide the surgeon with a comprehensive visualisation of the organ. The second
      reasons is to allow for planning and surgical simulation that could be compared
      with the detailed flight-plan for a commercial jet pilot. The third lies in the
      fact that virtual reality is an integrated part of the concept of computer
      assisted surgical procedure. The project consists of a sophisticated simulator
      which must include five requirements: a) visual fidelity, b) interactivity, c)
      physical properties, d) physiological properties, e) sensory input and output. In
      this report we describe how to obtain a realistic 3D model of the liver from
      bi-dimensional 2D medical images for anatomical and surgical training. The
      introduction of a tumor and the consequent planning and virtual resection is also
      described, as are force feedback and real-time interaction.

AB  - Surgical simulation increasingly appears to be an essential aspect of tomorrow's 
      surgery. The development of a hepatic surgery simulator is an advanced concept
      calling for a new writing system which will transform the medical world: virtual 
      reality. Virtual reality extends the perception of our five senses by
      representing more than the real state of things by the means of computer sciences
      and robotics. It consists of three concepts: immersion, navigation and
      interaction. Three reasons have led us to develop this simulator: the first is to
      provide the surgeon with a comprehensive visualisation of the organ. The second
      reason is to allow for planning and surgical simulation that could be compared
      with the detailed flight-plan for a commercial jet pilot. The third lies in the
      fact that virtual reality is an integrated part of the concept of computer
      assisted surgical procedure. The project consists of a sophisticated simulator
      which has to include five requirements: visual fidelity, interactivity, physical 
      properties, physiological properties, sensory input and output. In this report we
      will describe how to get a realistic 3D model of the liver from bi-dimensional 2D
      medical images for anatomical and surgical training. The introduction of a tumor 
      and the consequent planning and virtual resection is also described, as are force
      feedback and real-time interaction.

PG  - 19-24
AB  - Simulation is becoming an increasingly accepted method for training personnel for
      complex or high risk tasks. With the advent of modern Virtual Reality (VR)
      technology, such simulations are becoming more and more immersive. One
      significant limitation to the advance of this science is the challenges
      associated with simulating the touch or feel of various tasks in conjunction with
      VR simulations. This work has focused on creating and assessing the feasibility
      of haptic technology for high fidelity surgery simulation. It has culminated in a
      prototypical interface device to provide tactile feedback during the simulation
      of complex interventional radiology procedures such as Angioplasty. This device
      extends state of the art motion control, distributed computing processes, high
      resolution sensors for real-time feedback, and modular design techniques to
      accomplish these goals. The realization of the device, its capabilities,
      interfacing requirements, its limitations, and future extensions will be
      presented here.
