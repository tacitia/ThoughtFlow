TI  - Thalamic control of sensory selection in divided attention.
PG  - 705-9
LID - 10.1038/nature15398 [doi]
AB  - How the brain selects appropriate sensory inputs and suppresses distractors is
      unknown. Given the well-established role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in
      executive function, its interactions with sensory cortical areas during attention
      have been hypothesized to control sensory selection. To test this idea and, more 
      generally, dissect the circuits underlying sensory selection, we developed a
      cross-modal divided-attention task in mice that allowed genetic access to this
      cognitive process. By optogenetically perturbing PFC function in a temporally
      precise window, the ability of mice to select appropriately between conflicting
      visual and auditory stimuli was diminished. Equivalent sensory thalamocortical
      manipulations showed that behaviour was causally dependent on PFC interactions
      with the sensory thalamus, not sensory cortex. Consistent with this notion, we
      found neurons of the visual thalamic reticular nucleus (visTRN) to exhibit
      PFC-dependent changes in firing rate predictive of the modality selected. visTRN 
      activity was causal to performance as confirmed by bidirectional optogenetic
      manipulations of this subnetwork. Using a combination of electrophysiology and
      intracellular chloride photometry, we demonstrated that visTRN dynamically
      controls visual thalamic gain through feedforward inhibition. Our experiments
      introduce a new subcortical model of sensory selection, in which the PFC biases
      thalamic reticular subnetworks to control thalamic sensory gain, selecting
      appropriate inputs for further processing.

TI  - PSD-Zip70 Deficiency Causes Prefrontal Hypofunction Associated with Glutamatergic
      Synapse Maturation Defects by Dysregulation of Rap2 Activity.
PG  - 14327-40
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2349-15.2015 [doi]
AB  - Dysregulation of synapse formation and plasticity is closely related to the
      pathophysiology of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) is particularly important for executive functions such as working
      memory, cognition, and emotional control, which are impaired in the disorders.
      PSD-Zip70 (Lzts1/FEZ1) is a postsynaptic density (PSD) protein predominantly
      expressed in the frontal cortex, olfactory bulb, striatum, and hippocampus. Here 
      we found that PSD-Zip70 knock-out (PSD-Zip70KO) mice exhibit working memory and
      cognitive defects, and enhanced anxiety-like behaviors. These abnormal behaviors 
      are caused by impaired glutamatergic synapse transmission accompanied by
      tiny-headed immature dendritic spines in the PFC, due to aberrant Rap2
      activation, which has roles in synapse formation and plasticity. PSD-Zip70
      modulates the Rap2 activity by interacting with SPAR (spine-associated RapGAP)
      and PDZ-GEF1 (RapGEF) in the postsynapse. Furthermore, suppression of the
      aberrant Rap2 activation in the PFC rescued the behavioral defects in PSD-Zip70KO
      mice. Our data demonstrate a critical role for PSD-Zip70 in Rap2-dependent spine 
      synapse development in the PFC and underscore the importance of this regulation
      in PFC-dependent behaviors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: PSD-Zip70 deficiency causes
      behavioral defects in working memory and cognition, and enhanced anxiety due to
      prefrontal hypofunction. This study revealed that PSD-Zip70 plays essential roles
      in glutamatergic synapse maturation via modulation of the Rap2 activity in the
      PFC. PSD-Zip70 interacts with both SPAR (spine-associated RapGAP) and PDZ-GEF1
      (RapGEF) and modulates the Rap2 activity in postsynaptic sites. Our results
      provide a novel Rap2-specific regulatory mechanism in synaptic maturation
      involving PSD-Zip70.

TI  - Impulsivity and Concussion in Juvenile Rats: Examining Molecular and Structural
      Aspects of the Frontostriatal Pathway.
PG  - e0139842
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0139842 [doi]
AB  - Impulsivity and poor executive control have been implicated in the pathogenesis
      of many developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Similarly, concussions/mild
      traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) have been associated with increased risk for
      neuropsychiatric disorders and the development of impulsivity and inattention.
      Researchers and epidemiologists have therefore considered whether or not
      concussions induce symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
      or merely unmask impulsive tendencies that were already present. The purpose of
      this study was to determine if a single concussion in adolescence could induce
      ADHD-like impulsivity and impaired response inhibition, and subsequently
      determine if inherent impulsivity prior to a pediatric mTBI would exacerbate
      post-concussion symptomology with a specific emphasis on impulsive and
      inattentive behaviours. As these behaviours are believed to be associated with
      the frontostriatal circuit involving the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), the expression patterns of 8 genes (Comt, Drd2, Drd3,
      Drd4, Maoa, Sert, Tph1, and Tph2) from these two regions were examined. In
      addition, Golgi-Cox staining of medium spiny neurons in the NAc provided a
      neuroanatomical examination of mTBI-induced structural changes. The study found
      that a single early brain injury could induce impulsivity and impairments in
      response inhibition that were more pronounced in males. Interestingly, when
      animals with inherent impulsivity experienced mTBI, injury-related deficits were 
      exacerbated in female animals. The single concussion increased dendritic
      branching, but reduced synaptic density in the NAc, and these changes were likely
      associated with the increase in impulsivity. Finally, mTBI-induced impulsivity
      was associated with modifications to gene expression that differed dramatically
      from the gene expression pattern associated with inherent impulsivity, despite
      very similar behavioural phenotypes. Our findings suggest the need to tailor
      treatment strategies for mTBI in light of an individual's premorbid
      characteristics, given significant differences in molecular profiles of the
      frontostriatal circuits that depend upon sex and the etiology of the behavioural 
      phenotype.

AB  - In Parkinson's disease, cognitive deficits manifest as fronto-striatally-mediated
      executive dysfunction, with impaired attention, planning, judgment, and impulse
      control. We examined changes in executive function in mice lesioned with
      subchronic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) using a 3-choice
      serial reaction-time (SRT) task, which included measures of sustained attention
      and impulse control. Each trial of the baseline SRT task comprised a
      pseudo-random pre-cue period ranging from 3 to 8 s, followed by a 1-s cue
      duration. MPTP impaired all measures of impulsive behavior acutely, but with
      additional training their performance normalized to saline control levels. When
      challenged with shorter cue durations, MPTP-lesioned mice had significantly
      slower reaction times than wild-type mice. When challenged with longer pre-cue
      times, the MPTP-lesioned mice exhibited a loss of impulse control at the longer
      durations. In lesioned mice, striatal dopamine was depleted by 54% and the number
      of tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta
      was reduced by 75%. Serotonin (5-HT) was unchanged in the striatum and prefrontal
      cortex (PFC), but the ratio of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) to 5-HT was
      significantly reduced in the MPTP group in the PFC. In lesioned mice, prefrontal 
      5-HIAA/5-HT was significantly correlated with the executive impairments and
      striatal norepinephrine was associated with slower reaction times. None of the
      neurochemical measures was significantly associated with behavior in
      saline-treated controls. Taken together, these results show that prefrontal 5-HT 
      turnover may play a pivotal role in MPTP-induced executive dysfunction.

      between three core brain networks.

LID - 10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00244 [doi]
AB  - Working memory (WM) refers to the temporary holding and manipulation of
      information during the performance of a range of cognitive tasks, and WM training
      is a promising method for improving an individual's cognitive functions. Our
      previous work demonstrated that WM performance can be improved through
      self-regulation of dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation using
      real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI), which enables
      individuals to control local brain activities volitionally according to the
      neurofeedback. Furthermore, research concerning large-scale brain networks has
      demonstrated that WM training requires the engagement of several networks,
      including the central executive network (CEN), the default mode network (DMN) and
      the salience network (SN), and functional connectivity within the CEN and DMN can
      be changed by WM training. Although a switching role of the SN between the CEN
      and DMN has been demonstrated, it remains unclear whether WM training can affect 
      the interactions between the three networks and whether a similar mechanism also 
      exists during the training process. In this study, we investigated the dynamic
      functional connectivity between the three networks during the rtfMRI feedback
      training using independent component analysis (ICA) and correlation analysis. The
      results indicated that functional connectivity within and between the three
      networks were significantly enhanced by feedback training, and most of the
      changes were associated with the insula and correlated with behavioral
      improvements. These findings suggest that the insula plays a critical role in the
      reorganization of functional connectivity among the three networks induced by
      rtfMRI training and in WM performance, thus providing new insights into the
      mechanisms of high-level functions and the clinical treatment of related
      functional impairments.

TI  - Prefrontal Engagement and Reduced Default Network Suppression Co-occur and Are
      Dynamically Coupled in Older Adults: The Default-Executive Coupling Hypothesis of
      Aging.
PG  - 2462-76
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00869 [doi]
AB  - Reduced executive control is a hallmark of neurocognitive aging. Poor modulation 
      of lateral pFC activity in the context of increasing task challenge in old adults
      and a "failure to deactivate" the default network during cognitive control tasks 
      have been observed. Whether these two patterns represent discrete mechanisms of
      neurocognitive aging or interact into older adulthood remains unknown. We
      examined whether altered pFC and default network dynamics co-occur during
      goal-directed planning over increasing levels of difficulty during performance on
      the Tower of London task. We used fMRI to investigate task- and age-related
      changes in brain activation and functional connectivity across four levels of
      task challenge. Frontoparietal executive control regions were activated and
      default network regions were suppressed during planning relative to counting
      performance in both groups. Older adults, unlike young, failed to modulate brain 
      activity in executive control and default regions as planning demands increased. 
      Critically, functional connectivity analyses revealed bilateral dorsolateral pFC 
      coupling in young adults and dorsolateral pFC to default coupling in older adults
      with increased planning complexity. We propose a default-executive coupling
      hypothesis of aging. First, this hypothesis suggests that failure to modulate
      control and default network activity in response to increasing task challenge are
      linked in older adulthood. Second, functional brain changes involve greater
      coupling of lateral pFC and the default network as cognitive control demands
      increase in older adults. We speculate that these changes reflect an adaptive
      shift in cognitive approach as older adults come to rely more upon stored
      representations to support goal-directed task performance.

AB  - Animal evidence suggests that a brain network involving the medial and rostral

      patients with Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and 11 patients with Corticobasal
      Syndrome (CBS) using MRI, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Sorting, 
      Tower, Twenty Questions, and Fluency tests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function
      System (D-KEFS). Deviations in MRI grey matter volume from 86 age-matched healthy
      control subjects were determined for the patients using FreeSurfer. Multivariate 
      regression was used to determine which brain areas were associated with specific 
      neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms. Decreased grey matter volume of the
      right medial ventral PFC was associated with increased anxiety and apathy,
      decreased volume of the right lateral ventral PFC with apathy and inappropriate
      repetitive behaviors, and of the left lateral ventral PFC with poor performance
      on the sorting and Twenty Questions task in patients with FTD and CBS. Similar to
      in animal studies, damage to the medial OFC appears to be associated with a
      disruption of arousal, and damage to the lateral OFC appears to be associated
      with deficits in trial-and-error learning and behavioral dysregulation. Studies
      of brain dysfunction in humans are valuable to bridge animal and human
      neuropsychiatric research.

TI  - High Susceptibility to Stress Associated with Increased Value-Driven Attentional 
      Capture.
PG  - 1346
LID - 10.1167/15.12.1346 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we are seeking to identify factors predicting value-driven
      attentional capture in the normal population. Previous research has shown that
      high levels of stress lead to addictive behaviors such as substance abuse (Sinha,
      2001), and also that recovering substance abuse addicts show more attentional
      capture for rewarded stimuli than the normal population (Anderson, Faulkner,
      Rilee, Yantis, & Marvel, 2013). We hypothesized that there may be a relationship 
      between susceptibility to stress and potential for attentional capture from
      rewarded stimuli in the normal (non-clinical) population. A sample of over 450
      participants filled out the Susceptibility to Stress scale (Miller, Smith, &
      Mehler, 1988) online and 23 also independently participated in a gamified visual 
      search training experiment which has previously been shown to lead to
      value-driven attentional capture (Miranda & Palmer, 2014). Results indicate that 
      higher scores on the Susceptibility to Stress scale were associated with larger
      amounts of attentional capture for both the low-reward (r2 = .24, F(1,21) = 6.54,
      p &lt; .05) and high-reward (r2 = .19, F(1,21) = 5.05, p &lt; .05) conditions.
      Therefore, individuals with high stress susceptibility may be more vulnerable to 
      reward-system engagement. These findings also coincide with previous research
      demonstrating that stressful conditions can lead to an increase in dopamine
      levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which disrupts PFC regulation and thereby 
      the executive control of attention, producing more bottom-up and less top-down
      attentional control (Arnsten, 2009). We hypothesize that individuals with greater
      stress susceptibility may have an overactive dopamine presence in the PFC leading
      to greater attentional capture from previously rewarded stimuli. We are currently
      investigating the relationship between participants' current stress levels and
      the amount of attentional capture they exhibit. Meeting abstract presented at VSS

      behavioral inhibition and anxiety in children.

LID - 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2015.08.010 [doi]
AB  - Children with behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperament characterized by
      biologically-based hyper-vigilance to novelty, display threat-related attention
      biases (AB) that shape developmental trajectories of risk for anxiety. Here we
      explore the relations between BI, neural function, and anxiety. Fifty-six
      9-12-year-olds (23 behaviorally inhibited) performed the dot-probe task while
      undergoing fMRI. AB scores were not associated with BI group or parent-rated
      anxiety symptoms. Trials requiring attention orienting away from threat engaged
      an executive and threat-attention network (dlPFC, vlPFC, mPFC, and amygdala).
      Within that network, behaviorally inhibited children showed greater activation in
      the right dlPFC. Heightened dlPFC activation related to increased anxiety, and BI
      levels accounted for the direct relation between dlPFC activation and anxiety.
      Behaviorally inhibited children may engage the executive attention system during 
      threat-related processing as a compensatory mechanism. We provide preliminary
      evidence that the link between PFC functioning and anxiety might be attributed to
      early-emerging temperamental vulnerabilities present before the emergence of
      clinical anxiety.

TI  - Altered prefrontal activity and connectivity predict different cognitive deficits
      in schizophrenia.
PG  - 4539-52
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22935 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunction is considered a core feature of schizophrenia, 
      and impaired performances in episodic memory (EM) and executive function (EF)
      tasks are consistently reported in schizophrenia patients. Traditional fMRI and
      EEG studies have helped identifying brain areas, including the prefrontal cortex 
      (PFC), involved in these tasks. However, it is unclear whether intrinsic defects 
      in prefrontal function per se contribute to poor performance in schizophrenia,
      given the presence of confounds like reduced motivation and psychotic symptoms.
      TMS/hd-EEG measurements are obtained without cognitive effort, and can be
      calculated in any cortical area. METHODS: We performed TMS/hd-EEG recordings in
      parietal, motor, premotor, and PFC in healthy individuals (N = 20) and
      schizophrenia patients (N = 20). Source modeling of TMS-evoked responses was
      performed, and measures of cortical activity (significant current density, SCD)
      and connectivity (significant current scattering, SCS) were computed. Patients
      with schizophrenia also performed Penn Word memory delayed (CPWd) and Penn
      Conditional Exclusion Test (PCET). CPWd evaluates EM and involves primarily PFC, 
      whereas PCET reflects EF and implicates PFC with other brain regions. FINDINGS:
      We found no difference in SCD and SCS after TMS of parietal/motor cortices,
      whereas those parameters were reduced in premotor/prefrontal areas in
      schizophrenia patients. In PFC, where these measures were most defective, SCD was
      negatively correlated with performance in CPWd whereas higher SCS values were
      associated with more errors in PCET. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that
      schizophrenia patients have intrinsic defects in both activity and connectivity
      of PFC, and that these defects are specifically associated with impairments in
      cognitive abilities. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4539-4552, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley

TI  - Catechol-O-methyltransferase Val158met polymorphism interacts with early
      experience to predict executive functions in early childhood.
PG  - 833-41
LID - 10.1002/dev.21332 [doi]
AB  - Numerous studies demonstrate that the Methionine variant of the
      catechol-O-methyltransferase Val158Met polymorphism, which confers less efficient
      catabolism of catecholamines, is associated with increased focal activation of
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) and higher levels of executive function abilities. By and
      large, however, studies of COMT Val158Met have been conducted with adult samples 
      and do not account for the context in which development is occurring. Effects of 
      early adversity on stress response physiology and the inverted U shape relating
      catecholamine levels to neural activity in PFC indicate the need to take into
      account early experience when considering relations between genes such as COMT
      and executive cognitive ability. Consistent with this neurobiology, we find in a 
      prospective longitudinal sample of children and families (N = 1292) that COMT
      Val158Met interacts with early experience to predict executive function abilities
      in early childhood. Specifically, the Valine variant of the COMT Val158Met
      polymorphism, which confers more rather than less efficient catabolism of
      catecholamines is associated with higher executive function abilities at child
      ages 48 and 60 months and with faster growth of executive function for children
      experiencing early adversity, as indexed by cumulative risk factors in the home
      at child ages 7, 15, 24, and 36 months. Findings indicate the importance of the
      early environment for the relation between catecholamine genes and developmental 
      outcomes and demonstrate that the genetic moderation of environmental risk is
      detectable in early childhood. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Psychobiol

TI  - Mapping Thalamocortical Functional Connectivity in Chronic and Early Stages of
      Psychotic Disorders.
LID - S0006-3223(15)00534-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.06.026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is considerable evidence that the thalamus is abnormal in
      psychotic disorders. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has
      revealed an intriguing pattern of thalamic dysconnectivity in psychosis
      characterized by reduced prefrontal cortex (PFC) connectivity and increased
      somatomotor-thalamic connectivity. However, critical knowledge gaps remain with
      respect to the onset, anatomical specificity, and clinical correlates of thalamic
      dysconnectivity in psychosis. METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic
      resonance imaging was collected on 105 healthy subjects and 148 individuals with 
      psychosis, including 53 early-stage psychosis patients. Using all 253 subjects,
      the thalamus was parceled into functional regions of interest (ROIs) on the basis
      of connectivity with six a priori defined cortical ROIs covering most of the
      cortical mantle. Functional connectivity between each cortical ROI and its
      corresponding thalamic ROI was quantified and compared across groups. Significant
      differences in the ROI-to-ROI analysis were followed up with voxel-wise
      seed-based analyses to further localize thalamic dysconnectivity. RESULTS: ROI
      analysis revealed reduced PFC-thalamic connectivity and increased
      somatomotor-thalamic connectivity in both chronic and early-stage psychosis
      patients. PFC hypoconnectivity and motor cortex hyperconnectivity correlated in
      patients suggesting they result from a common pathophysiological mechanism.
      Seed-based analyses revealed thalamic hypoconnectivity in psychosis localized to 
      dorsolateral PFC, medial PFC, and cerebellar areas of the well-described
      executive control network. Across all subjects, thalamic connectivity with areas 
      of the fronto-parietal network correlated with cognitive functioning, including
      verbal learning and memory. CONCLUSIONS: Thalamocortical dysconnectivity is
      present in both chronic and early stages of psychosis, includes reduced thalamic 
      connectivity with the executive control network, and is related to cognitive
      impairment.

      second or third trimesters of pregnancy, but the nature of the problem is poorly 
      understood. We hypothesized that these self-reports might reflect difficulties in
      working memory (WM). It was further hypothesized that antepartum depression
      (depression arising during pregnancy) may play an etiological role, either on its
      own or due to secondary changes in endocrine function or sleep. Using WM tasks
      that emphasized executive control processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) we compared pregnant women tested at 34-36weeks of gestation (n=28) with
      age- and education-matched non-pregnant controls (n=26). All pregnant women were 
      screened for depression. Evidence of a WM disturbance was found, and was evident 
      only among pregnant women showing depressive symptoms. In contrast, pregnant
      women who were not depressed showed WM performance that equalled, or even
      significantly exceeded, non-pregnant controls. No significant differences were
      observed on control tests of other cognitive functions. Multiple regression
      revealed that serum estradiol concentrations, along with severity of depressive
      affect but not sleep disruption, significantly predicted variation in the WM
      scores. In agreement with studies of estradiol and WM in other contexts, higher
      estradiol was associated with better WM, while higher levels of depressive
      symptoms predicted poorer WM. We conclude that memory disturbance during
      gestation might not be as widespread as commonly believed, but can be seen among 
      women experiencing antepartum depression. The high level of WM performance found 
      in healthy, non-depressed, pregnant women is discussed from an adaptationist
      perspective.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of neurological disability
      worldwide, and it has been estimated that about one quarter of stroke survivors
      experience some measurable long-term cognitive impairments. Many higher order
      cognitive deficits occur because of damage to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which 
      is one of the main areas of the brain responsible for executive functioning in
      mammals. Currently, there are few animal models that examine the effects of
      stroke on executive function. In this study we used bilateral micro-injections
      (1mul) of the vasoconstricting peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) into the medial PFC in
      male Sprague-Dawley rats (or vehicle control, N=17-18 per group) in order to
      model ischemic lesions in the medial PFC. The effects of these lesions on
      executive function were assessed using tests of set-shifting and temporal object 
      recognition. ET-1 injections in the medial PFC resulted in replicable and
      specific lesions within the PFC with an average infarct volume of
      16.63+/-2.71mm(3). The ischemic lesions resulted in specific contextual
      set-shifting deficits within the maze, including an increased number of trials to
      criterion and a significant difference in learning curves. However, no deficits
      in temporal order memory processing were noted between sham and stroke animals.
      We conclude that ischemic lesions localized to the mPFC result in selective but
      not generalized deficits in executive function in rats.

TI  - Neurodynamics of executive control processes in bilinguals: evidence from ERP and
      source reconstruction analyses.
PG  - 821
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00821 [doi]
AB  - The present study was designed to examine the impact of bilingualism on the
      neuronal activity in different executive control processes namely conflict
      monitoring, control implementation (i.e., interference suppression and conflict
      resolution) and overcoming of inhibition. Twenty-two highly proficient but
      non-balanced successive French-German bilingual adults and 22 monolingual adults 
      performed a combined Stroop/Negative priming task while event-related potential
      (ERP) were recorded online. The data revealed that the ERP effects were reduced
      in bilinguals in comparison to monolinguals but only in the Stroop task and
      limited to the N400 and the sustained fronto-central negative-going potential
      time windows. This result suggests that bilingualism may impact the process of
      control implementation rather than the process of conflict monitoring (N200).
      Critically, our study revealed a differential time course of the involvement of
      the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in conflict
      processing. While the ACC showed major activation in the early time windows (N200
      and N400) but not in the latest time window (late sustained negative-going
      potential), the PFC became unilaterally active in the left hemisphere in the N400
      and the late sustained negative-going potential time windows. Taken together, the
      present electroencephalography data lend support to a cascading
      neurophysiological model of executive control processes, in which ACC and PFC may
      play a determining role.

TI  - Autobiographical Planning and the Brain: Activation and Its Modulation by
      Qualitative Features.
PG  - 2147-57
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00846 [doi]
AB  - To engage in purposeful behavior, it is important to make plans, which organize
      subsequent actions. Most studies of planning involve "look-ahead" puzzle tasks
      that are unrelated to personal goals. We developed a task to assess
      autobiographical planning, which involves the formulation of personal plans in
      response to real-world goals, and examined autobiographical planning in 63 adults
      during fMRI scanning. Autobiographical planning was found to engage the default
      network, including medial-temporal lobe and midline structures, and executive
      control regions in lateral pFC and parietal cortex and caudate. To examine how
      specific qualitative features of autobiographical plans modulate neural activity,
      we performed parametric modulation analyses. Ratings of plan detail, novelty,
      temporal distance, ease of plan formulation, difficulty in goal completion, and
      confidence in goal accomplishment were used as covariates in six hierarchical
      linear regression models. This modeling procedure removed shared variance among
      the ratings, allowing us to determine the independent relationship between
      ratings of interest and trial-wise BOLD signal. We found that specific
      autobiographical planning, describing a detailed, achievable, and actionable
      planning process for attaining a clearly envisioned future, recruited both
      default and frontoparietal brain regions. In contrast, abstract autobiographical 
      planning, plans that were constructed from more generalized semantic or affective
      representations of a less tangible and distant future, involved interactions
      among default, sensory perceptual, and limbic brain structures. Specific
      qualities of autobiographical plans are important predictors of default and
      frontoparietal control network engagement during plan formation and reflect the
      contribution of mnemonic and executive control processes to autobiographical
      planning.

TI  - Association of exposure to neighborhood drug activity, neurobehavioral traits,
      and marijuana use among at-risk African American females.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Theories of relative deprivation suggest African Americans in
      disadvantaged communities are at increased risk for drug use. This increased risk
      may be due, in part, to exposure to drugs and drug subcultures. Given the
      significance of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) functioning in yielding behavior that
      is strategically guided rather than reactive to environmental demands, it is
      important to examine the relationship between PFC functioning, neighborhood drug 
      activity and substance use among African Americans residing in high risk
      communities. METHODS: A sample of 120 young adult African American females was
      recruited from high-risk neighborhoods. Each completed the modified version of
      the neighborhood environment scale, a neurobehavioral assessment designed to
      measure apathy, behavioral disinhibition and executive dysfunction, and provided 
      a urine sample that was tested for the presence of psychoactive drugs. RESULTS:
      Logistic regression analyses indicated that females with higher scores on
      behavioral disinhibition were 2.6 times more likely to test positive for
      marijuana (95%CI = 1.02, 6.57). Neither apathy nor executive dysfunction was
      related to marijuana use. No relationship emerged between neighborhood drug
      activity and marijuana use. CONCLUSIONS: Among the neurobehavioral traits
      considered only behavioral disinhibition was associated with marijuana use,
      suggesting that different neurobehavioral domains may be uniquely related to
      marijuana use. For females living in high risk environments, the extent to which 
      they are able to control impulses may provide some protection against marijuana
      use. Future studies focused on the moderating effects of behavioral disinhibition
      on the association of exposure to risk environments and marijuana use may prove
      beneficial. Further, the study adds to the small base of literature supporting
      the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale as a brief assessment to evaluate
      frontally-mediated neurobehavioral traits relevant to substance use. However,
      future studies aimed at examining the influence of neighborhood drug activity
      might benefit from more precise measures of exposure to neighborhood drug
      activity. More research to replicate and expand on the present findings is
      warranted.

AB  - To study rapid sensorimotor remapping, we developed a method to train rats in a
      behavior in which subjects are cued, on each trial, to apply a sensorimotor
      association to orient either toward a visual target ("Pro") or away from it,
      toward its reverse ("Anti"). Multiple behavioral asymmetries suggested that Anti 
      behavior is cognitively demanding while Pro is easier to learn and perform. This 
      is consistent with a prominent hypothesis in the primate literature that Anti
      requires prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas Pro could be mediated by midbrain
      superior colliculus (SC). Pharmacological inactivation of rat medial PFC
      supported its expected role in Anti. Remarkably, bilateral SC inactivation
      substantially impaired Anti while leaving Pro essentially intact. Moreover, SC
      inactivation eliminated the performance cost of switching from Anti to Pro tasks.
      Our results establish a rodent model of single-trial sensorimotor remapping and
      suggest a critical role for SC in the cognitively demanding Anti task.

AB  - Working memory (WM) has been defined as a cerebral function which allows us to
      maintain and manipulate information "online". One of the most widely used
      paradigms to assess WM is the n-back test. Despite its extensive application,
      some authors have questioned its capacity to assess the manipulation of WM load. 
      The present study introduces a new version of the n-back test to carry out this
      assessment. We use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to evaluate
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation. The modified n-back requires monitoring of
      sequentially presented stimuli (in this case the days of the week). The target
      response relates to a stimulus which appears previously, from 0 to 2 items back, 
      on the computer screen. Our data reveals that while modified and unmodified
      n-back activate the same regions of the left PFC, our modified 2-back version
      shows significantly higher activation in the left dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and
      the left frontal opercula. These results suggest that increased complexity in
      verbal WM tasks entail greater executive control, which would lead to an increase
      in cerebral blood flow to the areas associated with verbal WM. Therefore, an
      increase in the manipulation of WM load in verbal tasks reflects greater
      physiological activity in the left DLPFC and the left frontal opercula. The
      modified n-back test may also be incorporated into the armamentarium of valid
      instruments for the neuropsychological assessment of the maintenance and
      manipulation of verbal information in tasks requiring working memory.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although diet has a substantial influence on the aging brain, the
      relationship between biomarkers of diet and aspects of brain health remains
      unclear. This study examines the neural mechanisms that mediate the relationship 
      between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (O3PUFAs) and executive functions in 
      at-risk (APOE e4 carriers), cognitively intact older adults. We hypothesized that
      higher levels of O3PUFAs are associated with better performance in a particular
      component of the executive functions, namely cognitive flexibility, and that this
      relationship is mediated by gray matter volume of a specific region thought to be
      important for cognitive flexibility, the anterior cingulate cortex. METHODS: We
      examined 40 cognitively intact adults between the ages of 65 and 75 with the APOE
      e4 polymorphism to investigate the relationship between biomarkers of O3PUFAs,
      tests of cognitive flexibility (measured by the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function
      System Trail Making Test), and gray matter volume within regions of the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). RESULTS: A mediation analysis revealed that gray matter 
      volume within the left rostral anterior cingulate cortex partially mediates the
      relationship between O3PUFA biomarkers and cognitive flexibility. CONCLUSION:
      These results suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex acts as a mediator of
      the relationship between O3PUFAs and cognitive flexibility in cognitively intact 
      adults thought to be at risk for cognitive decline. Through their link to
      executive functions and neuronal measures of PFC volume, O3PUFAs show potential
      as a nutritional therapy to prevent dysfunction in the aging brain.

AB  - Adolescence is a critical period of brain maturation characterized by the
      reorganization of interacting neural networks. In particular the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC), a region involved in executive function, undergoes synaptic and
      neuronal pruning during this time in both humans and rats. Our laboratory has
      previously shown that rats lose neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
      and there is an increase in white matter under the frontal cortex between
      adolescence and adulthood. Female rats lose more neurons during this period, and 
      ovarian hormones may play a role as ovariectomy before adolescence prevents
      neuronal loss. However, little is known regarding the timing of neuroanatomical
      changes that occur between early adolescence and adulthood. In the present study,
      we quantified the number of neurons and glia in the male and female mPFC at
      multiple time points from preadolescence through adulthood (postnatal days 25,
      35, 45, 60 and 90). Females, but not males, lost a significant number of neurons 
      in the mPFC between days 35 and 45, coinciding with the onset of puberty. Counts 
      of GABA immunoreactive cell bodies indicated that the neurons lost were not
      primarily GABAergic. These results suggest that in females, pubertal hormones may
      exert temporally specific changes in PFC anatomy. As expected, both males and
      females gained white matter under the PFC throughout adolescence, though these
      gains in females were diminished after day 35, but not in males. The differences 
      in cell loss in males and females may lead to differential vulnerability to
      external influences and dysfunctions of the PFC that manifest in adolescence.

TI  - A Programmer-Interpreter Neural Network Architecture for Prefrontal Cognitive
      Control.
PG  - 1550017
LID - 10.1142/S0129065715500173 [doi]
AB  - There is wide consensus that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is able to exert
      cognitive control on behavior by biasing processing toward task-relevant
      information and by modulating response selection. This idea is typically framed
      in terms of top-down influences within a cortical control hierarchy, where
      prefrontal-basal ganglia loops gate multiple input-output channels, which in turn
      can activate or sequence motor primitives expressed in (pre-)motor cortices. Here
      we advance a new hypothesis, based on the notion of programmability and an
      interpreter-programmer computational scheme, on how the PFC can flexibly bias the
      selection of sensorimotor patterns depending on internal goal and task contexts. 
      In this approach, multiple elementary behaviors representing motor primitives are
      expressed by a single multi-purpose neural network, which is seen as a reusable
      area of "recycled" neurons (interpreter). The PFC thus acts as a "programmer"
      that, without modifying the network connectivity, feeds the interpreter networks 
      with specific input parameters encoding the programs (corresponding to network
      structures) to be interpreted by the (pre-)motor areas. Our architecture is
      validated in a standard test for executive function: the 1-2-AX task. Our results
      show that this computational framework provides a robust, scalable and flexible
      scheme that can be iterated at different hierarchical layers, supporting the
      realization of multiple goals. We discuss the plausibility of the
      "programmer-interpreter" scheme to explain the functioning of
      prefrontal-(pre)motor cortical hierarchies.

      layer II/III dendritic morphology of male adolescent rats.
PG  - 405-15
LID - 10.1002/syn.21827 [doi]
AB  - Developmental alcohol exposure in humans can produce a wide range of deficits
      collectively referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). FASD-related
      impairments in executive functioning later in life suggest long-term damage to
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In rodent neonates, moderate to high levels of
      alcohol exposure decreased frontal lobe brain size and altered medial PFC
      pyramidal neuron dendritic morphology. Previous research in our lab demonstrated 
      that neonatal alcohol exposure decreased basilar dendritic complexity but did not
      affect spine density in Layer II/III pyramidal neurons in 26- to 30-day-old rats.
      The current study adds to the literature by evaluating the effect of neonatal
      alcohol exposure on mPFC Layer II/III basilar dendritic morphology in adolescent 
      male rats. Additionally, it examines the potential for voluntary exercise to
      mitigate alcohol-induced deficits on mPFC dendritic complexity. An animal model
      of binge drinking during the third trimester of pregnancy was used. Rats were
      intubated with alcohol (alcohol-exposed, AE; 5.25 g kg(-1) day(-1)) on postnatal 
      days (PD) 4-9; two control groups were included (suckle control and
      sham-intubated). Rats were anesthetized and perfused with heparinized saline
      solution on PD 42, and brains were processed for Golgi-Cox staining.
      Developmental alcohol exposure decreased spine density and dendritic complexity
      of basilar dendrites of Layer II/III neurons in the medial PFC (mPFC) compared to
      dendrites of control animals. Voluntary exercise increased spine density and
      dendritic length in AE animals resulting in elimination of the differences
      between AE and SH rats. Thus, voluntary exercise during early adolescence
      selectively rescued alcohol-induced morphological deficits in the mPFC.

AB  - The frontoparietal control network, anatomically and functionally interposed
      between the dorsal attention network and default mode network, underpins
      executive control functions. Individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) commonly exhibit deficits in executive functions, which are
      mainly mediated by the frontoparietal control network. Involvement of the
      frontoparietal control network based on the anterior prefrontal cortex in
      neurobiological mechanisms of ADHD has yet to be tested. We used resting-state
      functional MRI and seed-based correlation analyses to investigate functional
      connectivity of the frontoparietal control network in a sample of 25 children
      with ADHD (7-14 years; mean 9.94 +/- 1.77 years; 20 males), and 25 age-, sex-,
      and performance IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children. All participants
      had limited in-scanner head motion. Spearman's rank correlations were used to
      test the associations between altered patterns of functional connectivity with
      clinical symptoms and executive functions, measured by the Conners' Continuous
      Performance Test and Spatial Span in the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test
      Automated Battery. Compared with TD children, children with ADHD demonstrated
      weaker connectivity between the right anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the
      right ventrolateral PFC, and between the left anterior PFC and the right inferior
      parietal lobule. Furthermore, this aberrant connectivity of the frontoparietal
      control network in ADHD was associated with symptoms of impulsivity and
      opposition-defiance, as well as impaired response inhibition and attentional
      control. The findings support potential integration of the disconnection model
      and the executive dysfunction model for ADHD. Atypical frontoparietal control
      network may play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of ADHD.

AB  - RATIONALE: Chronic marijuana (MJ) use among adolescents has been associated with 
      structural and functional abnormalities, particularly in developing regions
      responsible for higher order cognition. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated
      prefrontal (PFC) and parietal volumes and executive function in emerging adult MJ
      users and explored potential gender differences. METHODS: Participants (ages
      18-25) were 27 MJ users and 32 controls without neurologic or psychiatric
      disorders or heavy other drug use. A series of multiple regressions examined
      whether group status, past year MJ use, and their interactions with gender
      predicted ROI volumes. Post hoc analyses consisted of brain-behavior correlations
      between volumes and cognitive variables and Fisher's z tests to assess group
      differences. RESULTS: MJ users demonstrated significantly smaller medial
      orbitofrontal (mOFC; p = 0.004, FDR p = 0.024) and inferior parietal volumes (p =
      0.04, FDR p = 0.12); follow-up regressions found that increased past year MJ use 
      did not significantly dose-dependently predict smaller mOFC volume in a
      sub-sample of individuals with at least one past year MJ use. There were no
      significant gender interactions. There was a significant brain-behavior
      difference by group, such that smaller mOFC volumes were associated with poorer
      complex attention for MJ users (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Smaller mOFC volumes
      among MJ users suggest disruption of typical neurodevelopmental processes
      associated with regular MJ use for both genders. These results highlight the need
      for longitudinal, multi-modal imaging studies providing clearer information on
      timing of neurodevelopmental processes and neurocognitive impacts of youth MJ
      initiation.

TI  - The Association Between Implicit Alcohol Attitudes and Drinking Behavior is
      Moderated by Baseline Activation in the Lateral Prefrontal Cortex.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intense alcohol consumption is a risk factor for a number of health
      problems. Dual-process models assume that self-regulatory behavior such as
      drinking alcohol is guided by both reflective and impulsive processes. Evidence
      suggests that (a) impulsive processes such as implicit attitudes are more
      strongly associated with behavior when executive functioning abilities are low,
      and (b) higher neural baseline activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
      is associated with better inhibitory control. The present study integrates these 
      2 strands of research to investigate how individual differences in neural
      baseline activation in the lateral PFC moderate the association between implicit 
      alcohol attitudes and drinking behavior. METHOD: Baseline cortical activation was
      measured with resting electroencephalography (EEG) in 89 moderate drinkers. In a 
      subsequent behavioral testing session they completed measures of implicit alcohol
      attitudes and self-reported drinking behavior. RESULTS: Implicit alcohol
      attitudes were related to self-reported alcohol consumption. Most centrally,
      implicit alcohol attitudes were more strongly associated with drinking behavior
      in individuals with low as compared with high baseline activation in the right
      lateral PFC. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are in line with predictions made on the
      basis of dual-process models. They provide further evidence that individual
      differences in neural baseline activation in the right lateral PFC may contribute
      to executive functioning abilities such as inhibitory control. Moreover,
      individuals with strongly positive implicit alcohol attitudes coupled with a low 
      baseline activation in the right lateral PFC may be at greater risk of developing
      unhealthy drinking patterns than others. (PsycINFO Database Record

AB  - Prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex are key brain areas for
      magnitude representations. Whether active discrimination of numerosity changes
      neuronal representations is still not known. We simultaneously recorded from the 
      same recording sites in the PFC and ventral intraparietal area (VIP) before and
      after monkeys learned to actively discriminate the number of items in a set. Only
      PFC neurons, and not VIP neurons, exhibited heightened representation of number
      after numerosity training. Increased responsiveness of PFC was evidenced by
      enhanced differentiation of numerosity by the population of neurons, as well as
      increased numerosity encoding by individual selective neurons. None of these
      effects were observed in the VIP, in which neurons responded invariably to
      numerosity irrespective of behavioral relevance. This suggests elevated PFC
      participation during numerical task demands and executive control, whereas VIP
      encodes quantity as a perceptual category regardless of behavioral relevance.

TI  - Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia: A Transdiagnostic Biomarker of Emotion
      Dysregulation and Psychopathology.
PG  - 43-47
AB  - In the past two decades, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)-an index of
      parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)-mediated cardiac control-has emerged as a
      reliable peripheral biomarker of emotion regulation (ER). Reduced RSA and
      excessive RSA reactivity (i.e., withdrawal) to emotional challenge are observed
      consistently among individuals with poor ER capabilities, including those with
      various forms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and those with 
      specific psychopathological syndromes, including anxiety, phobias, attention
      problems, autism, callousness, conduct disorder, depression, non-suicidal
      self-injury, panic disorder, and trait hostility. Emerging evidence suggests that
      low RSA and excessive RSA reactivity index poor ER because they are downstream
      peripheral markers of prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction. Poorly modulated
      inhibitory efferent pathways from the medial PFC to the PNS result in reduced RSA
      and excessive RSA reactivity. According to this perspective, RSA is a
      non-invasive proxy for poor executive control over behavior, which characterizes 
      most forms of psychopathology.

      activity behavior.
PG  - 117
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00117 [doi]
AB  - Dominant explanatory models for physical activity behavior are limited by the
      exclusion of several important components, including temporal dynamics,
      ecological forces, and neurobiological factors. The latter may be a critical
      omission, given the relevance of several aspects of cognitive function for the
      self-regulatory processes that are likely required for consistent implementation 
      of physical activity behavior in everyday life. This narrative review introduces 
      temporal self-regulation theory (TST; Hall and Fong, 2007, 2013) as a new
      explanatory model for physical activity behavior. Important features of the model
      include consideration of the default status of the physical activity behavior, as
      well as the disproportionate influence of temporally proximal behavioral
      contingencies. Most importantly, the TST model proposes positive feedback loops
      linking executive function (EF) and the performance of physical activity
      behavior. Specifically, those with relatively stronger executive control (and
      optimized brain structures supporting it, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (PFC)) are able to implement physical activity with more consistency than 
      others, which in turn serves to strengthen the executive control network itself. 
      The TST model has the potential to explain everyday variants of incidental
      physical activity, sport-related excellence via capacity for deliberate practice,
      and variability in the propensity to schedule and implement exercise routines.

TI  - Brain Correlates of Cognitive Remediation in Schizophrenia: Activation Likelihood
      Analysis Shows Preliminary Evidence of Neural Target Engagement.
PG  - 1276-84
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbv025 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive remediation training (CRT) for schizophrenia has been found to improve 
      cognitive functioning and influence neural plasticity. However, with various
      training approaches and mixed findings, the mechanisms driving generalization of 
      cognitive skills from CRT are unclear. In this meta-analysis of extant imaging
      studies examining CRT's effects, we sought to clarify whether varying approaches 
      to CRT suggest common neural changes and whether such mechanisms are restorative 
      or compensatory. We conducted a literature search to identify studies appropriate
      for inclusion in an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. Our
      criteria required studies to consist of training-based interventions designed to 
      improve patients' cognitive or social functioning, including generalization to
      untrained circumstances. Studies were also required to examine changes in pre- vs
      posttraining functional activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging or
      positron emission tomography. The literature search identified 162 articles, 9 of
      which were appropriate for inclusion. ALE analyses comparing pre- and
      posttraining brain activation showed increased activity in the lateral and medial
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), parietal cortex, insula, and the caudate and thalamus.
      Notably, activation associated with CRT in the left PFC and thalamus partially
      overlapped with previous meta-analytically identified areas associated with
      deficits in working memory, executive control, and facial emotion processing in
      schizophrenia. We conclude that CRT interventions from varying theoretic
      modalities elicit plasticity in areas that support cognitive and socioemotional
      processes in this early set of studies. While preliminary, these changes appear
      to be both restorative and compensatory, though thalamocortical areas previously 
      associated with dysfunction may be common sources of plasticity for cognitive
      remediation in schizophrenia.

TI  - The neurobiology of emotion-cognition interactions: fundamental questions and
      strategies for future research.
PG  - 58
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00058 [doi]
AB  - Recent years have witnessed the emergence of powerful new tools for assaying the 
      brain and a remarkable acceleration of research focused on the interplay of
      emotion and cognition. This work has begun to yield new insights into fundamental
      questions about the nature of the mind and important clues about the origins of
      mental illness. In particular, this research demonstrates that stress, anxiety,
      and other kinds of emotion can profoundly influence key elements of cognition,
      including selective attention, working memory, and cognitive control. Often, this
      influence persists beyond the duration of transient emotional challenges,
      partially reflecting the slower molecular dynamics of catecholamine and hormonal 
      neurochemistry. In turn, circuits involved in attention, executive control, and
      working memory contribute to the regulation of emotion. The distinction between
      the 'emotional' and the 'cognitive' brain is fuzzy and context-dependent. Indeed,
      there is compelling evidence that brain territories and psychological processes
      commonly associated with cognition, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      and working memory, play a central role in emotion. Furthermore, putatively
      emotional and cognitive regions influence one another via a complex web of
      connections in ways that jointly contribute to adaptive and maladaptive behavior.
      This work demonstrates that emotion and cognition are deeply interwoven in the
      fabric of the brain, suggesting that widely held beliefs about the key
      constituents of 'the emotional brain' and 'the cognitive brain' are fundamentally
      flawed. We conclude by outlining several strategies for enhancing future
      research. Developing a deeper understanding of the emotional-cognitive brain is
      important, not just for understanding the mind but also for elucidating the root 
      causes of its disorders.

PG  - 1394-401
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000001446 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between regional white and gray matter
      volume loss and performance on executive functions (EFs) in patients with
      penetrating traumatic brain injury (pTBI). METHODS: We studied 164 pTBI patients 
      and 43 healthy controls from the Vietnam Head Injury Study. We acquired CT scans 
      for pTBI patients and divided them according to lesion localization (left and
      right prefrontal cortex [PFC]). We administered EF tests (Verbal Fluency, Trail
      Making, Twenty Questions) and used voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) and 
      group-based correlational and multiple regression analyses to examine the
      relative influence of gray and white matter lesions on EF recovery. RESULTS: The 
      VLSM analysis revealed that white and gray white matter lesions were associated
      with impaired EFs. In the left PFC lesion group, damage to the PFC gray matter,
      anterior corona radiata, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) were most
      correlated with functional recovery. Verbal Fluency, which involves a broad
      fronto-temporo-parietal network, was best predicted by SLF lesion volume. Trail
      Making and Twenty Questions, which is associated with more focal left frontal
      damage, was better predicted by PFC lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated
      that white matter volume loss can be a superior predictor of recovery and a
      crucial factor driving clinical outcome in functions involving a broad network
      such as Verbal Fluency. White matter damage may place additional burden on
      recovery by deteriorating signal transmission between cortical areas within a
      functional network.

AB  - Exposure to stressful or traumatic events is associated with increased
      vulnerability to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This vulnerability may be
      partly mediated by effects of stress on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
      associated circuitry. The PFC mediates critical cognitive functions, including
      cognitive flexibility, which reflects an organism's ability to adaptively alter
      behavior in light of changing contingencies. Prior work suggests that chronic or 
      acute stress exerts complex effects on different forms of cognitive flexibility, 
      via actions on the PFC. Similarly, PFC dysfunction is reported in PTSD, as are
      executive function deficits. Animal models that permit study of the effects of
      stress/trauma on cognitive flexibility may be useful in illuminating ways in
      which stress-linked cognitive changes contribute to PTSD. Here, we examined the
      behavioral effects of a rodent model of PTSD - single prolonged stress (SPS) - on
      performance of two forms of cognitive flexibility: reversal learning and strategy
      set-shifting. SPS did not impair acquisition of either a response or visual-cue
      discrimination but did cause slight impairments in the retrieval of the
      visual-cue rule. During response discrimination reversal, SPS rats made more
      perseverative errors. In comparison, during set-shifting from the visual-cue to
      response discrimination, SPS rats did not show enhanced perseveration, but did
      display increased never-reinforced errors, indicative of impairment in selecting 
      a novel strategy. These data demonstrate that SPS leads to a complex and
      intriguing pattern of deficits in flexible responding and suggest that
      impairments in executive functioning associated with PTSD could, in part, be a
      neuro-cognitive consequence of trauma exposure.

AB  - The dopamine transporter (DAT1) gene has been associated with impulsivity and
      executive functioning. Further, DAT1 has been associated with brain structural
      characteristics and resting state connectivity. This study tested an indirect
      effect model in which DAT1 genotype (9-repeat (9R) carriers vs 10-repeat (10R)
      homozygotes) is linked to phenotypes representing impulsivity and executive
      function (planning behavior) through effects on white matter (WM) volumes in
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Adolescents
      (ages 14-18, n=38) were recruited from substance use treatment (n=22) and the
      community (n=16) to increase phenotype variation. Results indicated that DAT1
      10/10 genotype was associated with lower WM volume in the PFC, specifically the
      left OFC. Further, lower WM volume in the left OFC predicted more difficulties in
      self-reported planning behavior, but not impulsivity. Indirect effect analysis
      indicated that lower WM volume in the left OFC mediated the association between
      DAT1 10/10 genotype and difficulties in planning behavior. Results suggest a
      brain structural mechanism, involving lower WM volume in the left OFC, as a link 
      in the association between DAT1 genotype and a specific aspect of executive
      function. Genetic effects on regional WM volume that are linked to behavioral
      outcomes could ultimately inform the development of tailored interventions that
      address an individuals unique risk factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists augment cognition
      among cigarette smokers and nonsmokers, yet the systems-level neurobiological
      mechanisms underlying such improvements are not fully understood. Aggregating
      neuroimaging results regarding nAChR agonists provides a means to identify common
      functional brain changes that may be related to procognitive drug effects.
      METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of pharmacologic neuroimaging studies
      within the activation likelihood estimation framework. We identified published
      studies contrasting a nAChR drug condition versus a baseline and coded each
      contrast by activity change direction (decrease or increase), participant
      characteristics (smokers or nonsmokers), and drug manipulation employed
      (pharmacologic administration or cigarette smoking). RESULTS: When considering
      all studies, nAChR agonist administration was associated with activity decreases 
      in multiple regions, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC),
      posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), parahippocampus, insula, and the parietal and
      precentral cortices. Conversely, activity increases were observed in lateral
      frontoparietal cortices, the anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and cuneus.
      Exploratory analyses indicated that both smokers and nonsmokers showed activity
      decreases in the vmPFC and PCC, and increases in lateral frontoparietal regions. 
      Among smokers, both pharmacologic administration and cigarette smoking were
      associated with activity decreases in the vmPFC, PCC, and insula and increases in
      the lateral PFC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and cuneus.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the systems-level perspective that
      nAChR agonists suppress activity in default-mode network regions and enhance
      activity in executive control network regions in addition to reducing activation 
      of some task-related regions. We speculate these are potential mechanisms by
      which nAChR agonists enhance cognition.

PG  - 273

AB  - BACKGROUND: A wide range of evidence supports the methylphenidate (MPH)-induced
      enhancement of prefrontal cortex (PFC) functioning and improvements in behavioral
      symptoms in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
      Although working memory (WM) has been hypothesized to be impaired in patients
      with ADHD, no pharmacological studies have examined visuospatial WM (VSWM) with
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). STUDY AIM: The present study was designed to
      investigate the acute effects of MPH on neuropsychological performance and
      hemodynamic activation in children with ADHD during VSWM tasks. METHODS: The
      subject group included 10 boys and 1 girl previously diagnosed with ADHD. Two
      VSWM tasks of differing degrees of difficulty were conducted. This is the first
      study on the pharmacological effects of MPH in children with ADHD to evaluate
      hemodynamic responses in the PFC with simultaneous NIRS. RESULTS: No significant 
      differences were found in the scores for both spatial working memory (SWM) and
      score of spatial span (SSP) tasks between the MPH-off and MPH-on conditions.
      However, a significant MPH-effect on changes in oxy-hemoglobin levels in the PFC 
      was found only in the SWM task. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PFC
      activation might be affected by MPH, depending on the degree of difficulty of the
      particular task. Although the MPH-induced change on behavior may or may not be
      obvious, NIRS measurements might be useful for assessing the psychological
      effects of MPH even when performance changes were not observed in the cognitive
      tasks.

TI  - Moderate-level prenatal alcohol exposure induces sex differences in dopamine d1
      receptor binding in adult rhesus monkeys.
PG  - 2934-43

AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and/or 
      prenatal stress exposure on (D1 R) binding in a non human primate model. The
      dopamine D1 R is involved in executive function, and it may play a role in
      cognitive behavioral deficits associated with prenatal alcohol and/or stress
      exposure. Little is known, however, about the effects of prenatal alcohol and/or 
      stress exposure on the D1 R. We expected that prenatal insults would lead to
      alterations in D1 R binding in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum in adulthood.
      METHODS: Rhesus macaque females were randomly assigned to moderate alcohol
      exposure and/or mild prenatal stress as well as a control condition during
      pregnancy. Thirty-eight offspring were raised identically and studied as adults
      by noninvasive in vivo neuroimaging using positron emission tomography with the
      D1 antagonist radiotracer [(11) C]SCH 23390. Radiotracer binding in PFC and
      striatum was evaluated by 2 (alcohol) x 2 (stress) x 2 (sex) analysis of
      variance. RESULTS: In PFC, a significant alcohol x sex interaction was observed
      with prenatal alcohol exposure leading to increased [(11) C]SCH 23390 binding in 
      male monkeys. No main effect of prenatal alcohol or prenatal stress exposure was 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure
      results in long-term increases in prefrontal dopamine D1 R binding in males. This
      may help explain gender differences in the prevalence of neurodevelopmental
      disorders consequent to prenatal alcohol exposure.

TI  - Hippocampal-dorsolateral prefrontal coupling as a species-conserved cognitive
      mechanism: a human translational imaging study.
PG  - 1674-81
LID - 10.1038/npp.2015.13 [doi]
AB  - Hippocampal-prefrontal cortex (HC-PFC) interactions are implicated in working
      memory (WM) and altered in psychiatric conditions with cognitive impairment such 
      as schizophrenia. While coupling between both structures is crucial for WM
      performance in rodents, evidence from human studies is conflicting and
      translation of findings is complicated by the use of differing paradigms across
      species. We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging together with a 
      spatial WM paradigm adapted from rodent research to examine HC-PFC coupling in
      humans. A PFC-parietal network was functionally connected to hippocampus (HC)
      during task stages requiring high levels of executive control but not during a
      matched control condition. The magnitude of coupling in a network comprising HC, 
      bilateral dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and right supramarginal gyrus explained
      one-fourth of the variability in an independent spatial WM task but was unrelated
      to visual WM performance. HC-DLPFC coupling may thus represent a systems-level
      mechanism specific to spatial WM that is conserved across species, suggesting its
      utility for modeling cognitive dysfunction in translational neuroscience.

AB  - Gonadectomy in adult male rats significantly impairs spatial working memory,
      behavioral flexibility and other functions associated with the prefrontal cortex 
      (PFC). However, the mechanisms through which this occurs are largely unknown. In 
      this study, intracortical drug challenge with the selective N-methyl-d-aspartate 
      receptor (NMDAR) antagonist D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV) was
      combined with Barnes maze testing, gonadectomy (GDX) and hormone replacement
      (17beta-estradiol, testosterone propionate) to explore the contributions of
      NMDAR-mediated activity within the PFC to hormone effects on spatial cognition in
      adult male rats. Previous studies have shown that Barnes maze testing reveals
      significant estrogen-dependent, GDX-induced deficits in spatial working memory
      and androgen-sensitive, GDX-induced deficits in spatial search strategy. Here we 
      found that bilateral infusion of APV into the medial PFC prior to testing
      significantly improved both sets of behaviors in gonadectomized rats and
      significantly worsened performance measures in gonadally intact controls. In
      hormone-replaced cohorts, we further found that behaviors that are normally
      similar to controls were significantly disrupted by APV, and those that are
      normally similar to gonadectomized rats were rescued by intracortical APV
      infusion. There were, however, no residual effects of APV on retention testing
      conducted 24h later. Together these findings suggest that hormone regulation of
      NMDAR-mediated activity specifically within the PFC may be fundamental to the
      effects of gonadal steroids on spatial cognition in males. Our findings further
      identify NMDAR antagonists as potentially novel, non-steroidal means of
      attenuating the cognitive deficits that can accompany gonadal hormone decline in 
      human males in aging, clinical cases of hypogonadalism and in certain neurologic 
      and psychiatric illnesses. Accordingly, it may be important to obtain in males
      the kind of detailed knowledge concerning hormone effects on, for example, the
      channel and electrophysiological properties of NMDAR that currently exists for
      the female brain.

AB  - The gene Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) has been indicated as a determinant
      of psychopathology, including affective disorders, and shown to influence
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus functioning, regions of major interest
      for affective disorders. We aimed to investigate whether DISC1 differentially
      modulates brain function during executive and memory processing, and morphology
      in regions relevant for depression and anxiety disorders (affective disorders).
      128 participants, with (n = 103) and without (controls; n = 25) affective
      disorders underwent genotyping for Ser704Cys (with Cys-allele considered as
      risk-allele) and structural and functional (f) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
      during visuospatial planning and emotional episodic memory tasks. For both
      voxel-based morphometry and fMRI analyses, we investigated the effect of genotype
      in controls and explored genotypeXdiagnosis interactions. Results are reported at
      p < 0.05 FWE small volume corrected. In controls, Cys-carriers showed smaller
      bilateral (para)hippocampal volumes compared with Ser-homozygotes, and lower
      activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral PFC during
      visuospatial planning. In anxiety patients, Cys-carriers showed larger
      (para)hippocampal volumes and more ACC activation during visuospatial planning.
      In depressive patients, no effect of genotype was observed and overall, no effect
      of genotype on episodic memory processing was detected. We demonstrated that
      Ser704Cys-genotype influences (para)hippocampal structure and functioning the
      dorsal PFC during executive planning, most prominently in unaffected controls.
      Results suggest that presence of psychopathology moderates Ser704Cys effects.

TI  - Incongruent reduction of serotonin transporter associated with suicide attempts
      in patients with major depressive disorder: a positron emission tomography study 
      with 4-[18F]-ADAM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Much evidence supports the role of the serotonin transporter (SERT)
      in the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of major depressive disorder (MDD) and
      suicidal behaviors. METHODS: In this study, we recruited 17 antidepressant-naive 
      patients with MDD and 17 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. SERT
      availability was measured in vivo with
      N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-[(18)F]fluorophenylthio)benzylamine (4-[(18)F]-ADAM)
      positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The 21-item Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation were used to assess the
      severity of depression and the intent of suicide ideation prior to PET imaging.
      All subjects with MDD were in a current state of depression with HDRS scores
      >==18. Subjects who attempted suicide within two weeks of the study onset were
      recruited in the depressed suicidal group (n = 8). Subjects with MDD who denied
      any prior suicide attempt were recruited into the depressed non-suicidal group (n
      = 9). RESULTS: A significant reduction of SERT availability in the midbrain,
      thalamus, and striatum was noted in the MDD group relative to the control group
      (Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.05). Moreover, this effect was more pronounced
      in the depressed suicidal group compared to the control group
      (Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.01). Relative to both the depressed non-suicidal
      and control groups, the depressed suicidal group showed an increased prefrontal
      cortex (PFC)/midbrain SERT binding ratio (Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.01).
      CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an incongruent reduction of PFC SERT binding
      relative to the midbrain might discriminate between depressed suicide attempters 
      and non-attempters in patients with MDD and may be involved in the
      pathophysiology of suicide behaviors.

AB  - Inductive reasoning is an everyday process that allows us to make sense of the
      world by creating rules from a series of instances. Consistent with accounts of
      process-based fractionations of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) along the left-right 
      axis, inductive reasoning has been reliably localized to left PFC. However, these
      results may be confounded by the task domain, which is typically verbal. Indeed, 
      some studies show that right PFC activation is seen with spatial tasks. This
      study used fMRI to examine the effects of process and domain on the brain regions
      recruited during a novel pattern discovery task. Twenty healthy young adult
      participants were asked to discover the rule underlying the presentation of a
      series of letters in varied spatial locations. The rules were either verbal
      (pertaining to a single semantic category) or spatial (geometric figures).
      Bilateral ventrolateral PFC activations were seen for the spatial domain, while
      the verbal domain showed only left ventrolateral PFC. A conjunction analysis
      revealed that the two domains recruited a common region of left ventrolateral
      PFC. The data support a central role of left PFC in inductive reasoning.
      Importantly, they also suggest that both process and domain shape the
      localization of reasoning in the brain.

AB  - Flexibly applying abstract rules is a hallmark feature of executive functioning
      represented by prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons. Prefrontal networks are regulated
      by the neuromodulator dopamine, but how dopamine modulates high-level executive
      functions remains elusive. In monkeys performing a rule-based decision task, we
      report that both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors facilitated rule coding of PFC
      neurons, albeit by distinct physiological mechanisms. Dopamine D1 receptor
      stimulation suppressed neuronal firing while increasing responses to the
      preferred rule, thereby enhancing neuronal rule coding. D2 receptor stimulation, 
      instead, excited neuronal firing while suppressing responses to the nonpreferred 
      rule, thus also enhancing neuronal rule coding. These findings highlight
      complementary modulatory contributions of dopamine receptors to the neuronal
      circuitry mediating executive functioning and goal-directed behavior.

AB  - Sleep and sleep disorders are complex and highly variable phenotypes regulated by
      many genes and environment. The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is an
      interesting candidate, being one of the major mammalian enzymes involved in the
      catabolism of catecholamines. The activity of COMT enzyme is genetically
      polymorphic due to a guanine-to-adenine transition at codon 158, resulting in a
      valine (Val) to methionine (Met) substitution. Individuals homozygous for the Val
      allele show higher COMT activity, and lower dopaminergic signaling in prefrontal 
      cortex (PFC) than subjects homozygous for the Met allele. Since COMT has a
      crucial role in metabolising dopamine, it was suggested that the common
      functional polymorphism in the COMT gene impacts on cognitive function related to
      PFC, sleep-wake regulation, and potentially on sleep pathologies. The COMT
      Val158Met polymorphism may predict inter-individual differences in brain
      electroencephalography (EEG) alpha oscillations and recovery processes resulting 
      from partial sleep loss in healthy individuals. The Val158Met polymorphism also
      exerts a sexual dimorphism and has a strong effect on objective daytime
      sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy. Since the COMT enzyme
      inactivates catecholamines, it was hypothesized that the response to stimulant
      drugs differs between COMT genotypes. Modafinil maintained executive functioning 
      performance and vigilant attention throughout sleep deprivation in subjects with 
      Val/Val genotype, but less in those with Met/Met genotype. Also, homozygous
      Met/Met patients with narcolepsy responded to lower doses of modafinil compared
      to Val/Val carriers. We review here the critical role of the common functional
      COMT gene polymorphism, COMT enzyme activity, and the prefrontal dopamine levels 
      in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness in normal subjects, in narcolepsy and 
      other sleep-related disorders, and its impact on the response to
      psychostimulants.

AB  - Poor-quality maternal diet during pregnancy, and subsequent gestational growth
      disturbances in the offspring, have been implicated in the etiology of multiple
      neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD, schizophrenia, and autism. These
      disorders are characterized, in part, by abnormalities in responses to reward and
      errors of executive function. Here, we demonstrate dissociable deficits in reward
      processing and executive function in male and female mice, solely due to maternal
      malnutrition via high-fat or low-protein diets. Gestational exposure to a
      high-fat diet delayed acquisition of a fixed ratio response, and decreased
      motivation as assessed by progressive ratio. In contrast, offspring of a
      low-protein diet displayed no deficits in operant learning, but were more prone
      to assign salience to a cue that predicts reward (sign-tracking) in a
      Pavlovian-conditioned approach task. In the 5-choice serial reaction time task
      (5-CSRTT), gestational exposure to a high-fat diet promoted impulsivity, whereas 
      exposure to a low-protein diet led to marked inattention. These dissociable
      executive function deficits are known to be mediated by the medial prefrontal
      cortex (PFC), which displays markers of epigenetic dysregulation in
      neurodevelopmental disorders. Following behavioral characterization, we assayed
      PFC gene expression using a targeted PCR array and found that both maternal diets
      increased overall transcription in PFC. Cluster analysis of the relationships
      between individual transcripts and behavioral outcomes revealed a cluster of
      primarily epigenetic modulators, whose overexpression was linked to executive
      function deficits. The overexpression of four genes, DNA methyltransferase 1
      (DNMT1), delta-opioid receptor (OPRD1), cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1), and
      catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT), was strongly associated with overall poor
      performance. All 5-CSRTT deficits were associated with DNMT1 upregulation,
      whereas impulsive behavior could be dissociated from inattention by
      overexpression of OPRD1 or COMT, respectively, as well as a distinct cluster of
      epigenetic regulators. These data provide molecular support for dissociable
      domains of executive function.

AB  - Globally, over 25% of all children under the age of 5 years experience
      malnutrition leading to cognitive and emotional impairments that can persist into
      adulthood and beyond. We use a rodent model to determine the impact of prenatal
      protein malnutrition on executive functions in an attentional set-shifting task
      and metabolic activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) subregions critical to these
      behaviors. Long-Evans dams were provided with a low (6% casein) or adequate (25% 
      casein) protein diet 5 weeks before mating and during pregnancy. At birth, the
      litters were culled to 8 pups and fostered to control dams on the 25% casein
      diet. At postnatal day 90, prenatally malnourished rats were less able to shift
      attentional set and reverse reward contingencies than controls, demonstrating
      cognitive rigidity. Naive same-sexed littermates were assessed for regional brain
      activity using the metabolic marker (14)C-2-deoxyglucose (2DG). The prenatally
      malnourished rats had lower metabolic activity than controls in prelimbic,
      infralimbic, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortices, but had comparable
      activity in the nearby piriform cortex and superior colliculus. This study
      demonstrates that prenatal protein malnutrition in a well-described animal model 
      produces cognitive deficits in tests of attentional set shifting and reversal
      learning, similar to findings of cognitive inflexibility reported in humans
      exposed to early childhood malnutrition.

AB  - Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has been used to investigate 
      intrinsic brain connectivity in healthy subjects and patients with chronic pain. 
      Sex-related differences in the frequency power distribution within the human
      insula (INS), a brain region involved in the integration of interoceptive,
      affective, and cognitive influences, have been reported. Here we aimed to test
      sex and disease-related alterations in the intrinsic functional connectivity of
      the dorsal anterior INS. The anterior INS is engaged during goal-directed tasks
      and modulates the default mode and executive control networks. By comparing
      functional connectivity of the dorsal anterior INS in age-matched female and male
      healthy subjects and patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common
      chronic abdominal pain condition, we show evidence for sex and disease-related
      alterations in the functional connectivity of this region: (1) male patients
      compared with female patients had increased positive connectivity of the dorsal
      anterior INS bilaterally with the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsal
      posterior INS; (2) female patients compared with male patients had greater
      negative connectivity of the left dorsal anterior INS with the left precuneus;
      (3) disease-related differences in the connectivity between the bilateral dorsal 
      anterior INS and the dorsal medial PFC were observed in female subjects; and (4) 
      clinical characteristics were significantly correlated to the insular
      connectivity with the dorsal medial PFC in male IBS subjects and with the
      precuneus in female IBS subjects. These findings are consistent with the INS
      playing an important role in modulating the intrinsic functional connectivity of 
      major networks in the resting brain and show that this role is influenced by sex 
      and diagnosis.

AB  - The attention system functionally modulates brain activity to exert control over 
      thoughts, feelings and actions. Three distinct but mutually interacting
      components of attention have been hypothesized: alerting, which mediates the
      maintenance of a state of vigilance toward an upcoming stimulus; orienting, which
      supports the selection of sensory information, and executive control that is
      involved in detecting and resolving cognitive conflicts. The performance of tasks
      probing these components engages fronto-parietal and thalamic regions. Also,
      general attention has been associated with the activity of resting-state networks
      (RSNs), which are sets of brain regions with synchronous temporal fluctuations.
      Importantly, the association between the intrinsic brain activity of RSNs and the
      efficiency and integration of the specific attentional components remains largely
      unexplored. For this aim, we recruited twenty healthy volunteers who performed
      the Attention Network Test-Revised (ANT-R), assessing the alerting, orienting and
      executive control components as well as their interactions, and underwent
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. For each participant RSNs
      were estimated using double regression. The RSNs spanning across areas previously
      implicated in attentional processing were correlated with ANT-R scores using
      multiple regressions. Significant brain behavior correlations emerged between
      ANT-R scores and RSNs comprising the regions relevant for attentional processing,
      i.e., left and right prefronto-parietal (PFC-PC), dorsal attentional (DAN),
      salience (SN), and default mode (DMN) networks. The activity of PFC-PC networks
      was correlated with alerting in parietal and frontal regions, and with location
      conflict in the frontal regions. The DAN connectivity was correlated with
      flanker, location conflict, and their interaction in parietal regions. SN was
      associated with flanker by location and flanker by orienting interactions in the 
      inferior frontal regions. Finally, the activity of the DMN was associated with
      flanker conflict in midline structures such as precuneus and anterior cingulate
      cortex and also in right angular gyrus. These results suggest that the brain is
      endowed with an intrinsic functional organization to support attention, not only 
      in its global function, but also in its distinct components.

AB  - The present article promotes a formal executive model of frontal functions
      underlying speech production, bringing together hierarchical theories of adaptive
      behavior in the (pre-)frontal cortex (pFC) and psycho- and neurolinguistic
      approaches to spoken language within an information-theoretic framework. Its
      biological plausibility is revealed through two Activation Likelihood Estimation 
      meta-analyses carried out on a total of 41 hemodynamic studies of overt word and 
      continuous speech production respectively. Their principal findings, considered
      in light of neuropsychological evidence and earlier models of speech-related
      frontal functions, support the engagement of a caudal-to-rostral gradient of pFC 
      activity operationalized by the nature and quantity of speech-related information
      conveyed by task-related external cues (i.e., cue codability) on the one hand,
      and the total informational content of generated utterances on the other. In
      particular, overt reading or repetition and picture naming recruit primarily
      caudal motor-premotor regions involved in the sensorimotor and phonological
      aspects of speech; word and sentence generation engage mid- ventro- and
      dorsolateral areas supporting its basic predicative and syntactic functions;
      finally, rostral- and fronto-polar cortices subsume domain-general strategic
      processes of discourse generation for creative speech. These different levels
      interact in a top-down fashion, ranging representationally and temporally from
      the most general and extended to the most specific and immediate. The end-result 
      is an integrative theory of pFC as the main executive component of the language
      cortical network, which supports the existence of areas specialized for speech
      communication and articulation and regions subsuming internal reasoning and
      planning. Prospective avenues of research pertaining to this model's principal
      predictions are discussed.

AB  - Recent actions can benefit or disrupt our current actions and the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) is thought to play a major role in the regulation of these actions
      before they occur. The left PFC has been associated with overcoming interference 
      from past events in the context of language production and working memory. The
      right PFC, and especially the right IFG, has been associated with preparatory
      inhibition processes. But damage to the right PFC has also been associated with
      impairment in sustaining actions in motor intentional disorders. Moreover,
      bilateral dorsolateral PFC has been associated with the ability to maintain
      task-sets, and improve the performance of current actions based on previous
      experience. However, potential hemispheric asymmetries in anticipatory regulation
      of action have not yet been delineated. In the present study, patients with left 
      (n=7) vs. right (n=6) PFC damage due to stroke and 14 aged- and education-matched
      controls performed a picture naming and a verbal Simon task (participants had to 
      say "right" or "left" depending on the color of the picture while ignoring its
      position). In both tasks, performance depended on the nature of the preceding
      trial, but in different ways. In the naming task, performance decreased if
      previous pictures were from the same rather than from different semantic
      categories (i.e., semantic interference effect). In the Simon task, performance
      was better for both compatible (i.e., response matching the position of the
      stimulus) and incompatible trials when preceded by a trial of the same
      compatibility (i.e. Gratton effect) relative to sequential trials of different
      compatibility. Left PFC patients were selectively impaired in picture naming;
      they had an increased semantic interference effect compared to both right PFC
      patients and aged-matched controls. Conversely, right PFC patients were
      selectively impaired in the Simon task compared to controls or left PFC patients;
      they showed no benefit when sequential trials were compatible (cC vs. iC trials) 
      or a decreased Gratton effect. These results provide evidence for a double
      dissociation between left and right PFC in the anticipatory regulation of action.
      Our results are in agreement with a preponderant role of the left PFC in
      overcoming proactive interference from competing memory representations and
      provide evidence that the right PFC, plays a role in sustaining goal-directed
      actions consistent with clinical data in right PFC patients with motor
      intentional disorders.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a brain region responsible for executive functions
      including working memory, impulse control and decision making. The loss of these 
      functions may ultimately lead to addiction. Using histological analysis combined 
      with stereological technique, we demonstrated that the PFC is more vulnerable to 
      chronic alcohol-induced oxidative stress and neuronal cell death than the
      hippocampus. This increased vulnerability is evidenced by elevated oxidative
      stress-induced DNA damage and enhanced expression of apoptotic markers in PFC
      neurons. We also found that one-carbon metabolism (OCM) impairment plays a
      significant role in alcohol toxicity to the PFC seen from the difference in the
      effects of acute and chronic alcohol exposure on DNA repair and from exaggeration
      of the damaging effects upon additional OCM impairment in mice deficient in a key
      OCM enzyme, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Given that damage to the
      PFC leads to loss of executive function and addiction, our study may shed light
      on the mechanism of alcohol addiction.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0102524 [doi]
AB  - Chronic cocaine exposure in both human addicts and in rodent models of addiction 
      reduces prefrontal cortical activity, which subsequently dysregulates reward
      processing and higher order executive function. The net effect of this impaired
      gating of behavior is enhanced vulnerability to relapse. Previously we have shown
      that cocaine-induced increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
      expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a neuroadaptive mechanism
      that blunts the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine. As BDNF is known to affect
      neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity, we tested the hypothesis that
      abstinence from cocaine self-administration would lead to alterations in neuronal
      morphology and synaptic density in the PFC. Using a novel technique, array
      tomography and Golgi staining, morphological changes in the rat PFC were analyzed
      following 14 days of cocaine self-administration and 7 days of forced abstinence.
      Our results indicate that overall dendritic branching and total synaptic density 
      are significantly reduced in the rat PFC. In contrast, the density of thin
      dendritic spines are significantly increased on layer V pyramidal neurons of the 
      PFC. These findings indicate that dynamic structural changes occur during cocaine
      abstinence that may contribute to the observed hypo-activity of the PFC in
      cocaine-addicted individuals.

TI  - Function of basal ganglia in bridging cognitive and motor modules to perform an
      action.
PG  - 187
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2014.00187 [doi]
AB  - The basal ganglia (BG) are thought to be involved in the integration of multiple 
      sources of information, and their dysfunction can lead to disorders such as
      Parkinson's disease (PD). PD patients show motor and cognitive dysfunction with
      specific impairments in the internal generation of motor actions and executive
      deficits, respectively. The role of the BG, then, would be to integrate
      information from several sources in order to make a decision on a resulting
      action adequate for the required task. Reanalyzing the data set from our previous
      study (Martinu et al., 2012), we investigated this hypothesis by applying a graph
      theory method to a series of fMRI data during the performance of self-initiated
      (SI) finger movement tasks obtained in healthy volunteers (HV) and early stage PD
      patients. Dorsally, connectivity strength between the medial prefrontal areas
      (mPFC) and cortical regions including the primary motor area (M1), the
      extrastriate visual cortex, and the associative cortex, was reduced in the PD
      patients. The connectivity strengths were positively correlated to activity in
      the striatum in both groups. Ventrally, all connectivity between the striatum,
      the thalamus, and the extrastriate visual cortex decreased in strength in the PD,
      as did the connectivity between the striatum and the ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC).
      Individual response time (RT) was negatively correlated to connectivity strength 
      between the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and the striatum and positively correlated
      to connectivity between the VLPFC and the striatum in the HV. These results
      indicate that the BG, with the mPFC and thalamus, are involved in integrating
      multiple sources of information from areas such as DLPFC, and VLPFC, connecting
      to M1, thereby determining a network that leads to the adequate decision and
      performance of the resulting action.

TI  - Exposure to mission relevant doses of 1 GeV/Nucleon (56)Fe particles leads to
      impairment of attentional set-shifting performance in socially mature rats.
PG  - 292-8
LID - 10.1667/RR3766.1 [doi]
AB  - Previous ground-based experiments have shown that cranial irradiation with
      mission relevant (20 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles leads to a
      significant impairment in Attentional Set Shifting (ATSET) performance, a measure
      of executive function, in juvenile Wistar rats. However, the use of head only
      radiation exposure and the biological age of the rats used in that study may not 
      be pertinent to determine the likelihood that ATSET will be impaired in
      Astronauts on deep space flights. In this study we have determined the impact
      that whole-body exposure to 10, 15 and 20 cGy of 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles
      had on the ability (at three months post exposure) of socially mature (retired
      breeder) Wistar rats to conduct the attentional set-shifting paradigm. The
      current study has established that whole-body exposures to 15 and 20 (but not 10)
      cGy of 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles results in the impairment of ATSET in both 
      juvenile and socially mature rats. However, the exact nature of the impaired
      ATSET performance varied depending upon the age of the rats, whether whole-body
      versus cranial irradiation was used and the dose of 1 GeV/u (56)Fe received.
      Exposure of juvenile rats to 20 cGy of 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles led to a
      decreased ability to perform intra-dimensional shifting (IDS) irrespective of
      whether the rats received head only or whole-body exposures. Juvenile rats that
      received whole-body exposure also had a reduced ability to habituate to the assay
      and to complete intra-dimensional shifting reversal (IDR), whereas juvenile rats 
      that received head only exposure had a reduced ability to complete compound
      discrimination reversal (CDR). Socially mature rats that received whole-body
      exposures to 10 cGy of 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles exhibited no obvious
      decline in set-shifting performance; however those exposed to 15 and 20 cGy had a
      reduced ability to perform simple discrimination (SD) and compound discrimination
      (CD). Exposure to 20 cGy of 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles also led to a
      decreased performance in IDR and to approximately 25% of rats failing to
      habituate to the task. Most of these rats started to dig for the food reward but 
      rapidly (within 15 s) gave up digging, suggesting that they had developed
      appropriate procedural memories about food retrieval, but had an inability to
      maintain attention on the task. Our preliminary data suggests that whole-body
      exposure to 20 cGy of 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles reduced the cholinergic (but
      not the GABAergic) readily releasable pool (RRP) in nerve terminals of the basal 
      forebrain from socially-mature rats. This perturbation of the cholinergic RRP
      could directly lead to the loss of CDR and IDR performance, and indirectly
      [through the metabolic changes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)] to the
      loss of SD and CD performance. These findings provide the first evidence that
      attentional set-shifting performance in socially mature rats is impaired after
      whole-body exposure to mission relevant doses (15 and 20 cGy) of 1 GeV/nucleon
      (56)Fe particles, and importantly that a dose reduction down to 10 cGy prevents
      that impairment. The ability to conduct Discrimination tasks (SD and CD) and
      reversal learning (CDR) is reduced after exposure to 15 and 20 cGy of 1
      GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles, but at 20 cGy there is an additional decrement,
      approximately 25% of rats are unable to maintain attention to task. These
      behavioral decrements are associated with a reduction in the cholinergic RRP
      within basal forebrain, which has been shown to play a major role in regulating
      the activity of the PFC.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most prevalent
      mental disorders in the elderly, but its functional neuroanatomy is not well
      understood. Given the role of emotion dysregulation in GAD, we sought to describe
      the neural bases of emotion regulation in late-life GAD by analyzing the
      functional connectivity (FC) in the Salience Network and the Executive Control
      Network during worry induction and worry reappraisal. METHODS: The study included
      28 elderly GAD and 31 non-anxious comparison participants. Twelve elderly GAD
      completed a 12-week pharmacotherapy trial. We used an in-scanner worry script
      that alternates blocks of worry induction and reappraisal. We assessed network
      FC, using the following seeds: anterior insula (AI), dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (dlPFC), the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), and the
      paraventricular nucleus (PVN). RESULTS: GAD participants exhibited greater FC
      during worry induction between the left AI and the right orbitofrontal cortex,
      and between the BNST and the subgenual cingulate. During worry reappraisal, the
      non-anxious participants had greater FC between the left dlPFC and the medial
      PFC, as well as between the left AI and the medial PFC, and elderly GAD patients 
      had greater FC between the PVN and the amygdala. Following 12 weeks of
      pharmacotherapy, GAD participants had greater connectivity between the dlPFC and 
      several prefrontal regions during worry reappraisal. CONCLUSION: FC during worry 
      induction and reappraisal points toward abnormalities in both worry generation
      and worry reappraisal. Following successful pharmacologic treatment, we observed 
      greater connectivity in the prefrontal nodes of the Executive Control Network
      during reappraisal of worry.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Suicide is highly-prevalent and the most serious outcome in
      schizophrenia, yet the disturbances in neural system functions that confer
      suicide risk remain obscure. Circuits operated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are
      altered in psychotic disorders, and various PFC changes are observed in
      post-mortem studies of completed suicide. We tested whether PFC activity during
      goal-representation (an important component of cognitive control) relates to
      long-term suicide risk in recent-onset schizophrenia. METHOD: 35 patients with
      recent-onset of DSM-IV-TR-defined schizophrenia (SZ) were evaluated for long-term
      suicide risk (using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale) and functional
      MRI during cognitive control task performance. Group-level regression models
      associating control-related brain activation with suicide risk controlled for
      depression, psychosis and impulsivity. RESULTS: Within this group, past suicidal 
      ideation was associated with lower activation with goal-representation demands in
      multiple PFC sectors. Among those with past suicidal ideation (n=18), reported
      suicidal behavior was associated with lower control-related activation in
      premotor cortex ipsilateral to the active primary motor cortex. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study provides unique evidence that suicide risk directly relates to PFC-based
      circuit dysfunction during goal-representation, in a major mental illness with
      significant suicide rates. Among those with suicidal ideation, the overt
      expression in suicidal behavior may stem from impairments in premotor cortex
      support of action-planning as an expression of control. Further work should
      address how PFC-based control function changes with risk over time, whether this 
      brain-behavior relationship is specific to schizophrenia, and address its
      potential utility as a biomarker for interventions to mitigate suicide risk.

AB  - Executive functions are an emerging propriety of neuronal processing in circuits 
      encompassing frontal cortex and other cortical and subcortical brain regions such
      as basal ganglia and thalamus. Glutamate serves as the major neurotrasmitter in
      these circuits where glutamate receptors of NMDA type play key role. Serotonin
      and dopamine afferents are in position to modulate intrinsic glutamate
      neurotransmission along these circuits and in turn to optimize circuit
      performance for specific aspects of executive control over behavior. In this
      review, we focus on the 5-choice serial reaction time task which is able to
      provide various measures of attention and executive control over performance in
      rodents and the ability of prefrontocortical and striatal serotonin 5-HT1A,
      5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C as well as dopamine D1- and D2-like receptors to modulate
      different aspects of executive and attention disturbances induced by NMDA
      receptor hypofunction in the prefrontal cortex. These behavioral studies are
      integrated with findings from microdialysis studies. These studies illustrate the
      control of attention selectivity by serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and
      dopamine D1- but not D2-like receptors and a distinct contribution of these
      cortical and striatal serotonin and dopamine receptors to the control of
      different aspects of executive control over performance such as impulsivity and
      compulsivity. An association between NMDA antagonist-induced increase in
      glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex and attention is suggested.
      Collectively, this review highlights the functional interaction of serotonin and 
      dopamine with NMDA dependent glutamate neurotransmission in the cortico-striatal 
      circuitry for specific cognitive demands and may shed some light on how
      dysregulation of neuronal processing in these circuits may be implicated in
      specific neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently we showed that unilateral peripheral neuropathic lesions
      impacted differentially on rat's emotional/cognitive behavior depending on its
      left/right location; importantly, this observation recapitulates clinical
      reports. The prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region morphofunctionally affected 
      in chronic pain conditions, is involved in the modulation of both emotion and
      executive function and displays functional lateralization. To test whether the
      PFC is involved in the lateralization bias associated with left/right pain, c-fos
      expression in medial and orbital areas was analyzed in rats with an unilateral
      spared nerve injury neuropathy installed in the left or in the right side after
      performing an attentional set-shifting, a strongly PFC-dependent task. RESULTS:
      SNI-R animals required more trials to successfully terminate the reversal steps
      of the attentional set-shifting task. A generalized increase of c-fos density in 
      medial and orbital PFC (mPFC/OFC), irrespectively of the hemisphere, was observed
      in both SNI-L and SNI-R. However, individual laterality indexes revealed that
      contrary to controls and SNI-L, SNI-R animals presented a leftward shift in c-fos
      density in the ventral OFC (VO). None of these effects were observed in the
      neighboring primary motor area. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that chronic
      neuropathic pain is associated with a bilateral mPFC and OFC hyperactivation. We 
      hypothesize that the impaired performance of SNI-R animals is associated with a
      left/right activity inversion in the VO, whose functional integrity is critical
      for reversal learning.

      for independent modulation of prefrontal functions by midbrain dopaminergic and
      noradrenergic neurons.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.3389/fncir.2014.00053 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive functions associated with prefrontal cortex (PFC), such as working
      memory and attention, are strongly influenced by catecholamine [dopamine (DA) and
      norepinephrine (NE)] release. Midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the ventral
      tegmental area and noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus are major sources
      of DA and NE to the PFC. It is traditionally believed that DA and NE neurons are 
      homogeneous with highly divergent axons innervating multiple terminal fields and 
      once released, DA and NE individually or complementarily modulate the prefrontal 
      functions and other brain regions. However, recent studies indicate that both DA 
      and NE neurons in the mammalian brain are heterogeneous with a great degree of
      diversity, including their developmental lineages, molecular phenotypes,
      projection targets, afferent inputs, synaptic connectivity, physiological
      properties, and behavioral functions. These diverse characteristics could
      potentially endow DA and NE neurons with distinct roles in executive function,
      and alterations in their responses to genetic and epigenetic risk factors during 
      development may contribute to distinct phenotypic and functional changes in
      disease states. In this review of recent literature, we discuss how these
      advances in DA and NE neurons change our thinking of catecholamine influences in 
      cognitive functions in the brain, especially functions related to PFC. We review 
      how the projection-target specific populations of neurons in these two systems
      execute their functions in both normal and abnormal conditions. Additionally, we 
      explore what open questions remain and suggest where future research needs to
      move in order to provide a novel insight into the cause of neuropsychiatric
      disorders related to DA and NE systems.

TI  - Adolescent alcohol exposure reduces behavioral flexibility, promotes
      disinhibition, and increases resistance to extinction of ethanol
      self-administration in adulthood.
PG  - 2570-83
LID - 10.1038/npp.2014.109 [doi]
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a brain region that is critically involved in
      cognitive function and inhibitory control of behavior, and adolescence represents
      an important period of continued PFC development that parallels the maturation of
      these functions. Evidence suggests that this period of continued development of
      the PFC may render it especially vulnerable to environmental insults that impact 
      PFC function in adulthood. Experimentation with alcohol typically begins during
      adolescence when binge-like consumption of large quantities is common. In the
      present study, we investigated the effects of repeated cycles of adolescent
      intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure (postnatal days 28-42) by vapor inhalation on
      different aspects of executive functioning in the adult rat. In an operant
      set-shifting task, AIE-exposed rats exhibited deficits in their ability to shift 
      their response strategy when the rules of the task changed, indicating reduced
      behavioral flexibility. There were no differences in progressive ratio response
      for the reinforcer suggesting that AIE did not alter reinforcer motivation.
      Examination of performance on the elevated plus maze under conditions designed to
      minimize stress revealed that AIE exposure enhanced the number of entries into
      the open arms, which may reflect either reduced anxiety and/or disinhibition of
      exploratory-like behavior. In rats that trained to self-administer ethanol in an 
      operant paradigm, AIE increased resistance to extinction of ethanol-seeking
      behavior. This resistance to extinction was reversed by positive allosteric
      modulation of mGluR5 during extinction training, an effect that is thought to
      reflect promotion of extinction learning mechanisms within the medial PFC.
      Consistent with this, CDPPB was also observed to reverse the deficits in
      behavioral flexibility. Finally, diffusion tensor imaging with multivariate
      analysis of 32 brain areas revealed that while there were no differences in the
      total brain volume, the volume of a subgroup of regions (hippocampus, thalamus,
      dorsal striatum, neocortex, and hypothalamus) were significantly different in
      AIE-exposed adults compared with litter-matched Control rats. Taken together,
      these findings demonstrate that binge-like exposure to alcohol during early to
      middle adolescence results in deficits in PFC-mediated behavioral control in
      adulthood.

TI  - Neural Substrates of Dopamine D2 Receptor Modulated Executive Functions in the
      Monkey Prefrontal Cortex.
PG  - 2980-7
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhu096 [doi]
AB  - Dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) play a major role in cognition, mood and motor
      movements. Their blockade by antipsychotic drugs reduces hallucinatory and
      delusional behaviors in schizophrenia, but often fails to alleviate affective and
      cognitive dysfunctions. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) expresses D2R and is altered 
      in schizophrenia. We investigated how D2R modulate behavior and PFC function in
      monkeys. Two monkeys learned new and performed highly familiar visuomotor
      associations, where each cue was associated with a saccade to a right or left
      target. We recorded neural spikes and local field potentials from multiple
      electrodes while injecting the D2R antagonist eticlopride in the lateral PFC.
      Blocking prefrontal D2R impaired associative learning and cognitive flexibility, 
      reduced motivation, but left the performance of familiar associations intact.
      Eticlopride reduced saccade-direction selectivity of prefrontal neurons, leading 
      to a decrease in neural information about the associations, and an increase in
      alpha oscillations. These results, together with our recent study using a D1R
      antagonist, suggest that D1R and D2R in the primate lateral PFC cooperate to
      modulate several executive functions. Our findings help to gain insight into why 
      antipsychotic drugs, with strong antagonistic actions on D2R, fail to ameliorate 
      cognitive and emotional deficits in schizophrenia.

TI  - The subthalamic nucleus contributes to post-error slowing.
PG  - 2637-44
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00659 [doi]
AB  - pFC is proposed to implement cognitive control via directed "top-down" influence 
      over behavior. But how is this feat achieved? The virtue of such a descriptive
      model is contingent on a mechanistic understanding of how motor execution is
      altered in specific circumstances. In this report, we provide evidence that the
      well-known phenomenon of slowed RTs following mistakes (post-error slowing) is
      directly influenced by the degree of subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity. The STN 
      is proposed to act as a brake on motor execution following conflict or errors,
      buying time so a more cautious response can be made on the next trial. STN local 
      field potentials from nine Parkinson disease patients undergoing deep brain
      stimulation surgery were recorded while they performed a response conflict task. 
      In a 2.5- to 5-Hz frequency range previously associated with conflict and error
      processing, the degree phase consistency preceding the response was associated
      with increasingly slower RTs specifically following errors. These findings
      provide compelling evidence that post-error slowing is in part mediated by a
      corticosubthalamic "hyperdirect" pathway for increased response caution.

TI  - Aging affects the interaction between attentional control and source memory: an
      fMRI study.
PG  - 2653-69
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00663 [doi]
AB  - Age-related source memory impairments may be due, at least in part, to deficits
      in executive processes mediated by the PFC at both study and test. Behavioral
      work suggests that providing environmental support at encoding, such as directing
      attention toward item-source associations, may improve source memory and reduce
      age-related deficits in the recruitment of these executive processes. The present
      fMRI study investigated the effects of directed attention and aging on source
      memory encoding and retrieval. At study, participants were shown pictures of
      objects. They were either asked to attend to the objects and their color (source)
      or to their size. At test, participants determined if objects were seen before,
      and if so, whether they were the same color as previously. Behavioral results
      showed that direction of attention improved source memory for both groups;
      however, age-related deficits persisted. fMRI results revealed that, across
      groups, direction of attention facilitated medial temporal lobe-mediated
      contextual binding processes during study and attenuated right PFC postretrieval 
      monitoring effects at test. However, persistent age-related source memory
      deficits may be related to increased recruitment of medial anterior PFC during
      encoding, indicative of self-referential processing, as well as underrecruitment 
      of lateral anterior PFC-mediated relational processes. Taken together, this study
      suggests that, even when supported, older adults may fail to selectively encode
      goal-relevant contextual details supporting source memory performance.

TI  - Stability of executive function and predictions to adaptive behavior from middle 
      childhood to pre-adolescence.
PG  - 331
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00331 [doi]
AB  - The shift from childhood to adolescence is characterized by rapid remodeling of
      the brain and increased risk-taking behaviors. Current theories hypothesize that 
      developmental enhancements in sensitivity to affective environmental cues in
      adolescence may undermine executive function (EF) and increase the likelihood of 
      problematic behaviors. In the current study, we examined the extent to which EF
      in childhood predicts EF in early adolescence. We also tested whether individual 
      differences in neural responses to affective cues (rewards/punishments) in
      childhood serve as a biological marker for EF, sensation-seeking, academic
      performance, and social skills in early adolescence. At age 8, 84 children
      completed a gambling task while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. We
      examined the extent to which selections resulting in rewards or losses in this
      task elicited (i) the P300, a post-stimulus waveform reflecting the allocation of
      attentional resources toward a stimulus, and (ii) the SPN, a pre-stimulus
      anticipatory waveform reflecting a neural representation of a "hunch" about an
      outcome that originates in insula and ventromedial PFC. Children also completed a
      Dimensional Change Card-Sort (DCCS) and Flanker task to measure EF. At age 12, 78
      children repeated the DCCS and Flanker and completed a battery of questionnaires.
      Flanker and DCCS accuracy at age 8 predicted Flanker and DCCS performance at age 
      12, respectively. Individual differences in the magnitude of P300 (to losses vs. 
      rewards) and SPN (preceding outcomes with a high probability of punishment) at
      age 8 predicted self-reported sensation seeking (lower) and teacher-rated
      academic performance (higher) at age 12. We suggest there is stability in EF from
      age 8 to 12, and that childhood neural sensitivity to reward and punishment
      predicts individual differences in sensation seeking and adaptive behaviors in
      children entering adolescence.

AB  - The dorsal and ventral aspects of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are the two regions
      most consistently recruited in divergent thinking tasks. Given that frontal tasks
      have been shown to be vulnerable to sleep loss, we explored the impact of a
      single night of sleep deprivation on fluency (i.e., number of generated
      responses) and PFC function during divergent thinking. Participants underwent
      functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning twice while engaged in the
      Alternate Uses Task (AUT) - once following a single night of sleep deprivation
      and once following a night of normal sleep. They also wore wrist activity
      monitors, which enabled us to quantify daily sleep and model cognitive
      effectiveness. The intervention was effective, producing greater levels of
      fatigue and sleepiness. Modeled cognitive effectiveness and fluency were impaired
      following sleep deprivation, and sleep deprivation was associated with greater
      activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during AUT. The results
      suggest that an intervention known to temporarily compromise frontal function can
      impair fluency, and that this effect is instantiated in the form of an increased 
      hemodynamic response in the left IFG.

AB  - We use a biologically grounded neural network model to investigate the brain
      mechanisms underlying individual differences specific to the selection and
      instantiation of representations that exert cognitive control in task switching. 
      Existing computational models of task switching do not focus on individual
      differences and so cannot explain why task switching abilities are separable from
      other executive function (EF) abilities (such as response inhibition). We explore
      hypotheses regarding neural mechanisms underlying the "Shifting-Specific" and
      "Common EF" components of EF proposed in the Unity/Diversity model (Miyake &
      Friedman, 2012) and similar components in related theoretical frameworks. We do
      so by adapting a well-developed neural network model of working memory
      (Prefrontal cortex, Basal ganglia Working Memory or PBWM; Hazy, Frank, &
      O'Reilly, 2007) to task switching and the Stroop task, and comparing its behavior
      on those tasks under a variety of individual difference manipulations. Results
      are consistent with the hypotheses that variation specific to task switching
      (i.e., Shifting-Specific) may be related to uncontrolled, automatic persistence
      of goal representations, whereas variation general to multiple EFs (i.e., Common 
      EF) may be related to the strength of PFC representations and their effect on
      processing in the remainder of the cognitive system. Moreover, increasing signal 
      to noise ratio in PFC, theoretically tied to levels of tonic dopamine and a
      genetic polymorphism in the COMT gene, reduced Stroop interference but increased 
      switch costs. This stability-flexibility tradeoff provides an explanation for why
      these two EF components sometimes show opposing correlations with other variables
      such as attention problems and self-restraint.

PG  - 876-83

AB  - A dominant view of prefrontal cortex (PFC) function is that it stores
      task-relevant information in working memory. To examine this and determine how it
      applies when multiple pieces of information must be stored, we trained two
      subjects to perform a multi-item color change detection task and recorded
      activity of neurons in PFC. Few neurons encoded the color of the items. Instead, 
      the predominant encoding was spatial: a static signal reflecting the item's
      position and a dynamic signal reflecting the subject's covert attention. These
      findings challenge the notion that PFC stores task-relevant information. Instead,
      we suggest that the contribution of PFC is in controlling the allocation of
      resources to support working memory. In support of this, we found that increased 
      power in the alpha and theta bands of PFC local field potentials, which are
      thought to reflect long-range communication with other brain areas, was
      correlated with more precise color representations.

TI  - Individual differences in the balance of GABA to glutamate in pFC predict the
      ability to select among competing options.

AB  - Individuals vary greatly in their ability to select one item or response when
      presented with a multitude of options. Here we investigate the neural
      underpinnings of these individual differences. Using magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy, we found that the balance of inhibitory versus excitatory
      neurotransmitters in pFC predicts the ability to select among task-relevant
      options in two language production tasks. The greater an individual's
      concentration of GABA relative to glutamate in the lateral pFC, the more quickly 
      he or she could select a relevant word from among competing options. This outcome
      is consistent with our computational modeling of this task [Snyder, H. R.,
      Hutchison, N., Nyhus, E., Curran, T., Banich, M. T., O'Reilly, R. C., et al.
      Neural inhibition enables selection during language processing. Proceedings of
      the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 107, 16483-16488, 2010], which predicts
      that greater net inhibition in pFC increases the efficiency of resolving
      competition among task-relevant options. Moreover, the association with the
      GABA/glutamate ratio was specific to selection and was not observed for executive
      function ability in general. These findings are the first to link the balance of 
      excitatory and inhibitory neural transmission in pFC to specific aspects of
      executive function.

AB  - Problem-solving is an executive function subserved by a network of neural
      structures of which the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is central.
      Whereas several studies have evaluated the role of the DLPFC in problem-solving, 
      few standardized tasks have been developed specifically for use with functional
      neuroimaging. The current study adapted a measure with established validity for
      the assessment of problem-solving abilities to design a test more suitable for
      functional neuroimaging protocols. The Scarborough adaptation of the Tower of
      London (S-TOL) was administered to 38 healthy adults while hemodynamic
      oxygenation of the PFC was measured using 16-channel continuous-wave functional
      near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Compared to a baseline condition, problems
      that required two or three steps to achieve a goal configuration were associated 
      with higher activation in the left DLPFC and deactivation in the medial PFC.
      Individuals scoring higher in trait deliberation showed consistently higher
      activation in the left DLPFC regardless of task difficulty, whereas individuals
      lower in this trait displayed less activation when solving simple problems. Based
      on these results, the S-TOL may serve as a standardized task to evaluate
      problem-solving abilities in functional neuroimaging studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysthymic disorder (DD) is a depressive disorder characterised by
      persistent low and/or irritable mood and has been identified as a major risk
      factor for developing major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD and DD have been
      associated with executive function difficulties of working memory and attention. 
      Little is known about how executive function networks in the brain are affected
      in children and adolescents with MDD and even less in DD. This study used fMRI
      and two spatial working memory paradigms to investigate associated brain function
      in young people with DD and an age-, gender- and IQ- matched typically developing
      group. METHODS: Nineteen male patients with DD (mean age 11.2+/-1.5 years)
      diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria and 16 typically developing boys (mean age
      10.5+/-1.1 years) performed a mental rotation and a delay-match to sample (DMTS) 
      task while undergoing fMRI. All participants were medication-naive at the time of
      testing. RESULTS: Compared to typically developing young people, the DD group
      showed less activation in left frontal regions including left ventro- and
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (PFC) during mental rotation. Medial frontal
      regions including dorsomedial PFC, anterior cingulate cortex and frontal pole
      also showed relatively reduced activation. During the DMTS task patients showed
      significantly more activation in the right precuneus and posterior cingulate
      cortex. LIMITATIONS: This was a cross-sectional study with a small sample
      limiting the generalizability of the results. CONCLUSIONS: The results complement
      previous findings in adults with MDD that have shown differential activation of
      left PFC regions during working memory tasks. Additionally, altered function of
      cortical midline structures in young patients with DD was identified. This
      supports findings in children, adolescents and adults with MDD suggesting that
      the pathophysiology of depressive disorders extends to DD as a risk factor for
      MDD and exhibits continuity over the lifespan.

AB  - Motor performance deficits of older adults are due to dysfunction at multiple
      levels. Age-related differences have been documented on executive functions;
      motor control becomes more reliant on cognitive control mechanisms, including the
      engagement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), possibly compensating for age-related 
      sensorimotor declines. Since at functional level the PFC showed the largest
      age-related differences during discriminative response task, we wonder whether
      those effects are mainly due to the cognitive difficulty in stimulus
      discrimination or they could be also detected in a much easier task. In the
      present study, we measured the association of physical exercise with the PFC
      activation and response times (RTs) using a simple response task (SRT), in which 
      the participants were asked to respond as quickly as possible by manual key-press
      to visual stimuli. Simultaneous behavioral (RTs) and electroencephalographic
      (EEG) recordings were performed on 84 healthy participants aged 19-86 years. The 
      whole sample was divided into three cohorts (young, middle-aged, and older); each
      cohort was further divided into two equal sub-cohorts (exercise and not-exercise)
      based on a self-report questionnaire measuring physical exercise. The EEG signal 
      was segmented in epochs starting 1100 prior to stimulus onset and lasting 2 s.
      Behavioral results showed age effects, indicating a slowing of RTs with
      increasing age. The EEG results showed a significant interaction between age and 
      exercise on the activities recorded on the PFC. The results indicates that: (a)
      the brain of older adults needs the PFC engagement also to perform elementary
      task, such as the SRT, while this activity is not necessary in younger adults,
      (b) physical exercise could reduce this age-related reliance on extra cognitive
      control also during the performance of a SRT, and (c) the activity of the PFC is 
      a sensitive index of the benefits of physical exercise on sensorimotor decline.

AB  - Cognitive conflict detection and resolution develops with age across childhood
      and likely supports age-related increases in other aspects of cognitive and
      emotional development. Little is known about the neural correlates of conflict
      detection and resolution in early childhood. In the current study, we
      investigated age-related change in neural recruitment during a blocked
      spatial-incompatibility task (Simon task) in children ages 5-10 years using fMRI.
      Cortical thickness was measured using structural MRI. Across all children, there 
      was greater activation in right prefrontal and bilateral parietal cortices for
      incompatible than compatible conditions. In older children, compared with younger
      children, there was decreased activation and decreased gray matter thickness in
      the medial PFC. Thickness and activation changes across age were associated
      within participants, such that thinner cortex was associated with less activation
      in the rostral ACC. These findings suggest that developmental change in medial
      PFC activation supports performance on cognitive control tasks in early
      childhood.

AB  - Human memory is dynamic and flexible but is also susceptible to distortions
      arising from adaptive as well as pathological processes. Both accurate and false 
      memory formation require executive control that is critically mediated by the
      left prefrontal cortex (PFC). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      enables noninvasive modulation of cortical activity and associated behavior. The 
      present study reports that tDCS applied to the left dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC)
      shaped accuracy of episodic memory via polaritiy-specific modulation of false
      recognition. When applied during encoding of pictures, anodal tDCS increased
      whereas cathodal stimulation reduced the number of false alarms to lure pictures 
      in subsequent recognition memory testing. These data suggest that the enhancement
      of excitability in the dlPFC by anodal tDCS can be associated with blurred detail
      memory. In contrast, activity-reducing cathodal tDCS apparently acted as a noise 
      filter inhibiting the development of imprecise memory traces and reducing the
      false memory rate. Consistently, the largest effect was found in the most active 
      condition (i.e., for stimuli cued to be remembered). This first evidence for a
      polarity-specific, activity-dependent effect of tDCS on false memory opens new
      vistas for the understanding and potential treatment of disturbed memory control.

TI  - Effects of focal prefrontal cortex lesions on electrophysiological indices of
      executive attention and action control.
PG  - 233-43
LID - 10.1111/sjop.12106 [doi]
AB  - The human capacity to maintain an overarching control over mental states and
      behavior relies on multiple, distributed and dynamically interacting brain
      networks, in which prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role. PFC exerts
      top-down executive control over subcortical and posterior cortical areas via
      extensive reciprocal connections. The orbital, lateral, and medial PFC
      subdivisions are associated with distinct executive functions, but their precise 
      roles in large-scale neural networks remain to be determined. The main objective 
      of our research program is to specify cognitive and neural mechanisms that govern
      executive control functions. We study effects of focal PFC lesions on behavioral 
      and electrophysiological correlates of attention and action control utilizing
      experiments that relate to real-life requirements for executive control. We
      provide a selective review of studies on the impact of lesions to PFC subregions 
      on novelty processing, anticipatory attention, and action preparation and motor
      inhibition. The studies provide evidence for the contribution of both lateral,
      dorsomedial and orbital PFC in novelty processing and dynamic contextual
      updating. We also report evidence for a role of lateral PFC in motor preparation 
      and anticipatory attention. In contrast to the common view that orbitofrontal
      cortex plays a general role in inhibitory control, we report findings indicating 
      an involvement in action outcome monitoring rather than in behavioral inhibition 
      as such. We argue that improved understanding of how basic aspects of attentional
      control and inhibition is regulated in the brain, will shed light on the complex 
      behavioral, cognitive and emotional problems experienced by patients with
      executive dysfunction.

      the medial prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 3706-18
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0623-13.2014 [doi]
AB  - Dopamine (DA) receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) exert powerful
      effects on cognition by modulating the balance between excitatory and inhibitory 
      neurotransmission. The present study examined the impact of chronic intermittent 
      ethanol (CIE) exposure on cognitive function and DA receptor-mediated
      neurotransmission in the rat mPFC. Consistent with alterations in executive
      function in alcoholics, CIE-exposed rats exhibited deficits in behavioral
      flexibility in an operant set-shifting task. Since alterations in dopaminergic
      neurotransmission in the mPFC have been implicated in a number of behavioral
      disorders including addiction, studies were then performed in the adult acute
      slice preparation to examine changes in DA receptor function in the mPFC
      following CIE exposure. In slices obtained from control rats, DA receptor
      stimulation was observed to exert complex actions on neuronal firing and synaptic
      neurotransmission that were not only dependent upon the particular receptor
      subtype but also whether it was a pyramidal cell or a fast-spiking interneuron.
      In contrast to slices from control rats, there was a near complete loss of the
      modulatory actions of D2/D4 receptors on cell firing and neurotransmission in
      slices obtained immediately, 1 and 4 weeks after the last day of CIE exposure.
      This loss did not appear to be associated with changes in receptor expression. In
      contrast, CIE exposure did not alter D1 receptor function or mGluR1 modulation of
      firing. These studies are consistent with the suggestion that chronic alcohol
      exposure disrupts cognitive function at least in part through disruption of D2
      and D4 receptor signaling in mPFC.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) provides executive control of the brain in humans and
      rodents, coordinating cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to
      threatening stimuli and subsequent feedback inhibition of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The endocannabinoid system has emerged
      as a fundamental regulator of HPA axis feedback inhibition and an important
      modulator of emotional behavior. However, the precise role of endocannabinoid
      signaling within the PFC with respect to stress coping and emotionality has only 
      recently been investigated. This review discusses the current state of knowledge 
      regarding the localization and function of the endocannabinoid system in the PFC,
      its sensitivity to stress and its role in modulating the neuroendocrine and
      behavioral responses to aversive stimuli. We propose a model whereby steady-state
      endocannabinoid signaling in the medial PFC indirectly regulates the outflow of
      pyramidal neurons by fine-tuning GABAergic inhibition. Local activation of this
      population of CB1 receptors increases the downstream targets of medial PFC
      activation, which include inhibitory interneurons in the basolateral amygdala,
      inhibitory relay neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and monoamine
      cell bodies such as the dorsal raphe nucleus. This ultimately produces beneficial
      effects on emotionality (active coping responses to stress and reduced anxiety)
      and assists in constraining activation of the HPA axis. Under conditions of
      chronic stress, or in individuals suffering from mood disorders, this system may 
      be uniquely recruited to help maintain appropriate function in the face of
      adversity, while breakdown of the endocannabinoid system in the medial PFC may
      be, in and of itself, sufficient to produce neuropsychiatric illness. Thus, we
      suggest that endocannabinoid signaling in the medial PFC may represent an
      attractive target for the treatment of stress-related disorders.

AB  - Lesion studies link the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to executive functions. However, 
      the evidence from in vivo investigations in healthy people is mixed, and there
      are no quantitative estimates of the association strength. To examine the
      relationship between PFC volume and cortical thickness with executive cognition
      in healthy adults, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies that assessed
      executive functions and PFC volume (31 samples,) and PFC thickness (10 samples)
      in vivo, N=3272 participants. We found that larger PFC volume and greater PFC
      thickness were associated with better executive performance. Stronger
      associations between executive functions and PFC volume were linked to greater
      variance in the sample age but was unrelated to the mean age of a sample.
      Strength of association between cognitive and neuroanatomical indices depended on
      the executive task used in the study. PFC volume correlated stronger with
      Wisconsin Card Sorting Test than with digit backwards span, Trail Making Test and
      verbal fluency. Significant effect size was observed in lateral and medial but
      not orbital PFC. The results support the "bigger is better" hypothesis of
      brain-behavior relation in healthy adults and suggest different neural correlates
      across the neuropsychological tests used to assess executive functions.

TI  - The role of right prefrontal and medial cortex in response inhibition:
      interfering with action restraint and action cancellation using transcranial
      magnetic brain stimulation.
PG  - 1775-84
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00595 [doi]
AB  - The ability of inhibiting impulsive urges is paramount for human behavior. Such
      successful response inhibition has consistently been associated with activity in 
      pFC. The current study aims to unravel the differential involvement of different 
      areas within right pFC for successful action restraint versus action
      cancellation. These two conceptually different aspects of action inhibition were 
      measured with a go/no-go task (action restraint) and a stop signal task (action
      cancellation). Localization of relevant prefrontal activation was based on fMRI
      data. Significant task-related activation during successful action restraint was 
      localized for each participant individually in right anterior insula (rAI), right
      superior frontal gyrus, and pre-SMA. Activation during successful action
      cancellation was localized in rAI, right middle frontal gyrus, and pre-SMA.
      Subsequently, fMRI-guided continuous thetaburst stimulation was applied to these 
      regions. Results showed that the disruption of neural activity in rAI reduced
      both the ability to restrain (go/no-go) and cancel (stop signal) responses. In
      contrast, continuous thetaburst stimulation-induced disruption of the right
      superior frontal gyrus specifically impaired the ability to restrain from
      responding (go/no-go), while leaving the ability for action cancellation largely 
      intact. Stimulation applied to right middle frontal gyrus and pre-SMA did not
      affect inhibitory processing in neither of the two tasks. These findings provide 
      a more comprehensive perspective on the role of pFC in inhibition and cognitive
      control. The results emphasize the role of inferior frontal regions for global
      inhibition, whereas superior frontal regions seem to be specifically relevant for
      successful action restraint.

TI  - Individual differences in regional prefrontal gray matter morphometry and
      fractional anisotropy are associated with different constructs of executive
      function.

AB  - Although the relationship between structural differences within the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) and executive function (EF) has been widely explored in cognitively 
      impaired populations, little is known about this relationship in healthy young
      adults. Using optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM), surface-based morphometry 
      (SBM), and fractional anisotropy (FA) we determined the association between
      regional PFC grey matter (GM) morphometry and white matter tract diffusivity with
      performance on tasks that tap different aspects of EF as drawn from Miyake et
      al.'s three-factor model of EF. Reductions in both GM volume (VBM) and cortical
      folding (SBM) in the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC), and
      dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) predicted better common EF, shifting-specific, and
      updating-specific performance, respectively. Despite capturing different
      components of GM morphometry, voxel- and surface-based findings were highly
      related, exhibiting regionally overlapping relationships with EF. Increased white
      matter FA in fiber tracts that connect the vmPFC and vlPFC with posterior regions
      of the brain also predicted better common EF and shifting-specific performance,
      respectively. These results suggest that the neural mechanisms supporting
      distinct aspects of EF may differentially rely on distinct regions of the PFC,
      and at least in healthy young adults, are influenced by regional morphometry of
      the PFC and the FA of major white matter tracts that connect the PFC with
      posterior cortical and subcortical regions.

AB  - Although the cardinal features of Parkinson's disease (PD) are motor symptoms, PD
      also causes cognitive deficits including cognitive flexibility and working
      memory, which are strongly associated with prefrontal cortex (PFC) functions.
      Yet, early stage PD is not characterized by pathology in the PFC but by a loss of
      dopaminergic (DA) projections from the substantia nigra to the dorsal striatum.
      Moreover, the degree to which PD symptoms can be ascribed to the loss of DA alone
      or to the loss of DA neurons is unknown. We addressed these issues by comparing
      mouse models of either chronic DA depletion or loss of DA projections to the
      dorsal striatum. We achieved equal levels of striatal DA reduction in both models
      which ranged from mild (~25%) to moderate (~60%). Both models displayed DA
      concentration-dependent reductions of motor function as well as mild deficits of 
      cognitive flexibility and working memory. Interestingly, whereas both motor
      function and cognitive flexibility were more severely impaired after mild
      ablation of DA neurons as compared to mild loss of DA alone, both models had
      equal deficits after moderate loss of DA. Our results confirm contributions of
      nigro-striatal dopamine signaling to cognitive behaviors that are affected in
      early stage PD. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the phenotype after
      ablation of DA neurons accrues from factors beyond the mere loss of DA.

AB  - The gene Dyrk1a is the mammalian ortholog of Drosophila minibrain. Dyrk1a
      localizes in the Down syndrome (DS) critical region of chromosome 21q22.2 and is 
      a major candidate for the behavioral and neuronal abnormalities associated with
      DS. PFC malfunctions are a common denominator in several neuropsychiatric
      diseases, including DS, but the contribution of DYRK1A in PFC dysfunctions, in
      particular the synaptic basis for impairments of executive functions reported in 
      DS patients, remains obscure. We quantified synaptic plasticity, biochemical
      synaptic markers, and dendritic morphology of deep layer pyramidal PFC neurons in
      adult mBACtgDyrk1a transgenic mice that overexpress Dyrk1a under the control of
      its own regulatory sequences. We found that overexpression of Dyrk1a largely
      increased the number of spines on oblique dendrites of pyramidal neurons, as
      evidenced by augmented spine density, higher PSD95 protein levels, and larger
      miniature EPSCs. The dendritic alterations were associated with anomalous
      NMDAR-mediated long-term potentiation and accompanied by a marked reduction in
      the pCaMKII/CaMKII ratio in mBACtgDyrk1a mice. Retrograde
      endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (eCB-LTD) was ablated in
      mBACtgDyrk1a mice. Administration of green tea extracts containing
      epigallocatechin 3-gallate, a potent DYRK1A inhibitor, to adult mBACtgDyrk1a mice
      normalized long-term potentiation and spine anomalies but not eCB-LTD. However,
      inhibition of the eCB deactivating enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase normalized
      eCB-LTD in mBACtgDyrk1a mice. These data shed light on previously undisclosed
      participation of DYRK1A in adult PFC dendritic structures and synaptic
      plasticity. Furthermore, they suggest its involvement in DS-related
      endophenotypes and identify new potential therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Behavioral studies indicate that theory of mind and counterfactual reasoning are 
      strongly related cognitive processes. In a neuroimaging study, we explored the
      common and distinct regions underlying these inference processes. We directly
      compared false belief reasoning (inferring an agent's false belief about an
      object's location or content) and counterfactual reasoning (inferring what the
      object's location or content would be if an agent had acted differently), both in
      contrast with a baseline condition of conditional reasoning (inferring what the
      true location or content of an object is). Results indicate that these three
      types of reasoning about social scenarios are supported by activations in the
      mentalizing network (left temporo-parietal junction and precuneus) and the
      executive control network (bilateral prefrontal cortex [PFC] and right inferior
      parietal lobule). In addition, representing a false belief or counterfactual
      state (both not directly observable in the external world) recruits additional
      activity in the executive control network (left dorsolateral PFC and parietal
      lobe). The results further suggest that counterfactual reasoning is a more
      complex cognitive process than false belief reasoning, showing stronger
      activation of the dorsomedial, left dorsolateral PFC, cerebellum and left
      temporal cortex.

TI  - EEG theta/beta ratio as a potential biomarker for attentional control and
      resilience against deleterious effects of stress on attention.
PG  - 782-91

AB  - Anxious stress compromises cognitive executive performance. This occurs, for
      instance, in cognitive performance anxiety (CPA), in which anxiety about one's
      cognitive performance causes that performance to actually deteriorate (e.g., test
      anxiety). This is thought to result from a prefrontal cortically (PFC) mediated
      failure of top-down attentional control over stress-induced automatic processing 
      of threat-related information. In addition, stress-induced increased
      catecholamine influx into the PFC may directly compromise attentional function.
      Previous research has suggested that the ratio between resting state
      electroencephalographic (EEG) low- and high-frequency power (the theta/beta
      ratio) is related to trait attentional control, which might moderate these
      effects of stress on attentional function. The goals of the present study were to
      test the novel prediction that theta/beta ratio moderates the deleterious effects
      of CPA-like anxious stress on state attentional control and to replicate a
      previous finding that the theta/beta ratio is related to self-reported trait
      attentional control. After recording of baseline frontal EEG signals, 77
      participants performed a stress induction or a control procedure. Trait
      attentional control was assessed with the Attentional Control Scale, whereas
      stress-induced changes in attentional control and anxiety were measured with
      self-report visual analogue scales. The hypothesized moderating influence of
      theta/beta ratio on the effects of stress on state attentional control was
      confirmed. Theta/beta ratio explained 28% of the variance in stress-induced
      deterioration of self-reported attentional control. The negative relationship
      between theta/beta ratio and trait attentional control was replicated (r = -.33).
      The theta/beta ratio reflects, likely prefrontally mediated, attentional control,
      and should be a useful biomarker for the study of CPA and other anxiety-cognition
      interactions.

TI  - COMT and 5-HT1A-receptor genotypes potentially affect executive functions
      improvement after cognitive remediation in schizophrenia.
PG  - 509-516
AB  - Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) has been proved to improve cognitive deficits
      in schizophrenia and to enhance functional outcomes of classical rehabilitation. 
      However, CRT outcomes are heterogeneous and predictors of response are still
      unknown. Genetic variability, especially in the dopaminergic system, has been
      hypothesized to affect CRT. We previously reported that rs4680 of the
      catechol-O-methyltrasferase (COMT) influences improvements in executive functions
      in patients treated with CRT, but this result was not confirmed by other studies.
      Such inconsistent findings may depend, other than on clinical variables, also on 
      other genes involved in cognition. Recent studies proved that serotonin 1A
      receptor (5-HT1A-R) regulates dopamine in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and
      clinical works suggested a 5-HT1A-R role in cognition. We then analysed possible 
      effects of COMT rs4680 and 5-HT1A-R rs6295 on CRT outcomes, taking into account
      also clinical and demographic factors. Eighty-six clinically stabilized
      schizophrenia patients treated with three months CRT were assessed with the
      Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, as a measure of executive functions, at enrolment
      and after CRT treatment, and underwent COMT and 5-HT1A-R genotyping. We found a
      significant main effect of COMT genotype and an interaction with 5-HT1A-R on
      executive function improvement after CRT. The results suggest that these two
      polymorphisms may have an additive effect on individual capacity to recover from 
      cognitive deficit, probably through their role on PFC dopaminergic transmission
      modulation, known to be critical for modulating cognitive functions.

TI  - The neural bases of distracter-resistant working memory.
PG  - 90-105
LID - 10.3758/s13415-013-0226-y [doi]
AB  - A major difference between humans and other animals is our capacity to maintain
      information in working memory (WM) while performing secondary tasks, which
      enables sustained, complex cognition. A common assumption is that the lateral
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for WM performance in the presence of
      distracters, but direct evidence is scarce. We assessed the relationship between 
      fMRI activity and WM performance within subjects, with performance matched across
      distracter and no-distracter conditions. Activity in the ventrolateral PFC during
      WM encoding and maintenance positively predicted performance in both conditions, 
      whereas activity in the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) predicted
      performance only under distraction. Other parts of the dorsolateral and
      ventrolateral PFCs predicted performance only in the no-distracter condition.
      These findings challenge a lateral-PFC-centered view of distracter resistance,
      and suggest that the lateral PFC supports a type of WM representation that is
      efficient for dealing with task-irrelevant input but is, nonetheless, easily
      disrupted by dual-task demands.

TI  - Does the greater involvement of executive control in memory with age act as a
      compensatory mechanism?
PG  - 59-66
LID - 10.1037/cep0000005 [doi]
AB  - Recent behavioural and imaging data have shown that memory functioning seems to
      rely more on executive functions and on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in older than
      in young adults. Using a behavioural approach, our objective was to confirm the
      hypothesis that young and older adults present different patterns of correlation 
      between episodic memory performance and executive functioning. We report three
      studies comparing the correlations of young and older adults in a broad range of 
      episodic memory and executive function tasks. The results indicated that memory
      and executive performance were consistently and significantly correlated in older
      but not in younger adults. Regression analyses confirmed that age-related
      differences in episodic memory performance could be explained by individual
      differences in executive functioning. The results are consistent with the view
      that memory functioning in aging is accompanied by a shift from automatic to
      controlled forms of processing. They also generalise the executive hypothesis of 
      episodic memory aging and are in line with the idea that executive functions act 
      as a compensatory mechanism against age-related memory decline.

      neural mechanisms.

LID - 10.1002/hbm.22427 [doi]
AB  - Multitasking (MT) constitutes engaging in two or more cognitive activities at the
      same time. MT-training improves performance on untrained MT tasks and alters the 
      functional activity of the brain during MT. However, the effects of MT-training
      on neural mechanisms beyond MT-related functions are not known. We investigated
      the effects of 4 weeks of MT-training on regional gray matter volume (rGMV) and
      functional connectivity during rest (resting-FC) in young human adults.
      MT-training was associated with increased rGMV in three prefrontal cortical
      regions (left lateral rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), 
      and left inferior frontal junction), the left posterior parietal cortex, and the 
      left temporal and lateral occipital areas as well as decreased resting-FC between
      the right DLPFC and an anatomical cluster around the ventral anterior cingulate
      cortex (ACC). Our findings suggest that participation in MT-training is as a
      whole associated with task-irrelevant plasticity (i.e., neural changes are not
      limited to certain specific task conditions) in regions and the network that are 
      assumed to play roles in MT as well as diverse higher-order cognitive functions. 
      We could not dissociate the effects of each task component and the diverse
      cognitive processes involved in MT because of the nature of the study, and these 
      remain to be investigated.

      release in adult prefrontal cortex.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The experience of early stress contributes to the etiology of several
      psychiatric disorders and can lead to lasting deficits in working memory and
      attention. These executive functions require activation of the prefrontal cortex 
      (PFC) by muscarinic M1 acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. Such Galphaq-protein
      coupled receptors trigger the release of calcium (Ca(2+)) from internal stores
      and elicit prolonged neuronal excitation. METHODS: In brain slices of rat PFC, we
      employed multiphoton imaging simultaneously with whole-cell electrophysiological 
      recordings to examine potential interactions between ACh-induced Ca(2+) release
      and excitatory currents in adulthood, across postnatal development, and following
      the early stress of repeated maternal separation, a rodent model for depression. 
      We also investigated developmental changes in related genes in these groups.
      RESULTS: Acetylcholine-induced Ca(2+) release potentiates ACh-elicited excitatory
      currents. In the healthy PFC, this potentiation of muscarinic excitation emerges 
      in young adulthood, when executive function typically reaches maturity. However, 
      the developmental consolidation of muscarinic ACh signaling is abolished in
      adults with a history of early stress, where ACh responses retain an adolescent
      phenotype. In prefrontal cortex, these rats show a disruption in the expression
      of multiple developmentally regulated genes associated with Galphaq and Ca(2+)
      signaling. Pharmacologic and ionic manipulations reveal that the enhancement of
      muscarinic excitation in the healthy adult PFC arises via the electrogenic
      process of sodium/Ca(2+) exchange. CONCLUSIONS: This work illustrates a
      long-lasting disruption in ACh-mediated cortical excitation following early
      stress and raises the possibility that such cellular mechanisms may disrupt the
      maturation of executive function.

AB  - Attentional deficits and executive function impairments are common to many
      neurodevelopmental disorders of intellectual disability and autism, including
      Fragile X syndrome (FXS). In the knockout mouse model for FXS, significant
      changes in synaptic plasticity and connectivity are found in the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC)-a prominent region for attentional processing and executive control.
      Given these alterations in PFC synaptic function, we tested whether adult Fragile
      X knockout mice exhibited corresponding impairments in inhibitory control,
      perseveration, and sustained attention. Furthermore, we investigated individual
      performance during attentional rule acquisition. Using the 5-choice serial
      reaction time task, our results show no impairments in inhibitory control and
      sustained attention. Fragile X knockout mice exhibited enhanced levels of correct
      and incorrect responding, as well as perseveration of responding during initial
      phases of rule acquisition, that normalized with training. For both knockout and 
      wild type mice, pharmacological attenuation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 
      signaling did not affect response accuracy but reduced impulsive responses and
      increased omission errors. Upon rule reversal, Fragile X knockout mice made more 
      correct and incorrect responses, similar to the initial phases of rule
      acquisition. Analogous to heightened activity upon novel rule acquisition,
      Fragile X knockout mice were transiently hyperactive in both a novel open field
      (OF) arena and novel home cage. Hyperactivity ceased with familiarization to the 
      environment. Our findings demonstrate normal inhibitory control and sustained
      attention but heightened perseveration, responding, and hyperactivity during
      novel rule acquisition and during exposure to novel environments in Fragile X
      knockout mice. We therefore provide evidence for subtle but significant
      differences in the processing of novel stimuli in the mouse model for the FXS.

AB  - Repeated exposure to cocaine is known to produce persistent deficits in
      behavioral flexibility. Evidence suggests that these deficits are mediated in
      part by a circuit involving the medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices (PFC
      and OFC), nucleus accumbens (NAC), and basolateral amygdala (BLA). To assess the 
      effects of cocaine on this circuit, we treated rats with cocaine daily for 14 d, 
      followed by 4 weeks of abstinence. Animals were then tested on a cross-maze-based
      reversal learning and set-shifting task, after which they were anesthetized to
      allow for recording of spontaneous local field potential (LFP) activity
      simultaneously from all four regions, in addition to activity evoked from acute
      BLA stimulation. Cocaine-treated (COC) animals showed specific deficits in
      reversal learning; furthermore, spontaneous LFP oscillation power was reduced and
      BLA-induced oscillation power was increased in all regions compared with
      saline-treated (SAL) rats. Theta-burst stimulation of BLA potentiated BLA-evoked 
      responses in all regions and cocaine challenge reduced spontaneous oscillation
      power and evoked response amplitude, with no COC/SAL group differences. Notably, 
      cocaine challenge produced differential changes in coherence between OFC-BLA,
      BLA-NAC, and OFC-NAC in COC and SAL groups. These data indicate that repeated
      exposure to cocaine can produce changes in oscillatory LFP synchronization along 
      limbic cortico-striatal circuits that persist long into abstinence. Furthermore, 
      the regional specificity of these changes strongly correlates with the observed
      behavioral deficits. Aberrant synchronization within and between regions and
      consequent dysregulation of the neurocircuitry involved in executive control may 
      contribute to the long-lasting maladaptive decision making seen in cocaine
      abusers.

AB  - Small (lacunar) infarcts frequently arise in frontal and midline thalamic regions
      in the absence of major stroke. Damage to these areas often leads to impairment
      of executive function likely as a result of interrupting connections of the
      prefrontal cortex. Thus, patients experience frontal-like symptoms such as
      impaired ability to shift ongoing behavior and attention. In contrast, executive 
      dysfunction has not been demonstrated in rodent models of stroke, thereby
      limiting the development of potential therapies for human executive dysfunction. 
      Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=40) underwent either sham surgery or bilateral
      endothelin-1 injections in the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus or in the
      medial prefrontal cortex. Executive function was assessed using a rodent
      attention set shifting test that requires animals to shift attention to stimuli
      in different stimulus dimensions. Medial prefrontal cortex ischemia impaired
      attention shift performance between different stimulus dimensions while sparing
      stimulus discrimination and attention shifts within a stimulus dimension,
      indicating a selective attention set-shift deficit. Rats with mediodorsal
      thalamic lacunar damage did not exhibit a cognitive impairment relative to sham
      controls. The selective attention set shift impairment observed in this study is 
      consistent with clinical data demonstrating selective executive disorders
      following stroke within specific sub-regions of frontal cortex. These data
      contribute to the development and validation of a preclinical animal model of
      executive dysfunction, that can be employed to identify potential therapies for
      ameliorating cognitive deficits following stroke.

TI  - Executive control circuitry differentiates degree of success in weight loss
      following gastric-bypass surgery.
PG  - 2189-96
LID - 10.1002/oby.20575 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: While overall success rates of bariatric surgery are high,
      approximately 20% of patients either regain or never lose the expected amount of 
      weight. The purpose of this study was to determine whether, after gastric-bypass 
      surgery, the degree of weight loss can be differentiated based on the neural
      response to food cues. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this functional MRI study, 31
      post-surgical patients viewed food and neutral images in two counterbalanced runs
      during which they were either instructed to "crave" or to "resist" craving. The
      neural response to food cues was assessed within and between runs for all
      participants, and further analyzed between more successful (n = 24) and less
      successful (n = 7) groups. More successful was defined by meeting 50% excess
      weight loss. RESULTS: Overall, instructions to "crave" elicited significant
      activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) whereas "resist" elicited
      significant activity in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC). Between groups there was no
      brain difference when instructed to "crave." The more successful participants
      however had significantly more activity in the DLPFC when instructed to "resist."
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the ability to mobilize neural circuits 
      involved in executive control post-gastric-bypass surgery may be a unique
      component of successful outcome post-surgery.

      schizophrenia: a developmental perspective from schizotaxia to schizophrenia.
PG  - 604-35
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32170 [doi]
AB  - In an effort to identify the developing abnormalities preceding psychosis, Dr.
      Ming T. Tsuang and colleagues at Harvard expanded Meehl's concept of
      "schizotaxia," and examined brain structure and function in families affected by 
      schizophrenia (SZ). Here, we systematically review genetic (familial) high-risk
      (HR) studies of SZ using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), examine how findings
      inform models of SZ etiology, and suggest directions for future research.
      Neuroimaging studies of youth at HR for SZ through the age of 30 were identified 
      through a MEDLINE (PubMed) search. There is substantial evidence of gray matter
      volume abnormalities in youth at HR compared to controls, with an accelerated
      volume reduction over time in association with symptoms and cognitive deficits.
      In structural neuroimaging studies, prefrontal cortex (PFC) alterations were the 
      most consistently reported finding in HR. There was also consistent evidence of
      smaller hippocampal volume. In functional studies, hyperactivity of the right PFC
      during performance of diverse tasks with common executive demands was
      consistently reported. The only longitudinal fMRI study to date revealed
      increasing left middle temporal activity in association with the emergence of
      psychotic symptoms. There was preliminary evidence of cerebellar and default mode
      network alterations in association with symptoms. Brain abnormalities in
      structure, function and neurochemistry are observed in the premorbid period in
      youth at HR for SZ. Future research should focus on the genetic and environmental
      contributions to these alterations, determine how early they emerge, and
      determine whether they can be partially or fully remediated by innovative
      treatments.

AB  - One of the key brain regions in cognitive processing and executive function is
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which receives cholinergic input from basal
      forebrain cholinergic neurons. We evaluated the contribution of synaptically
      released acetylcholine (ACh) to executive function by genetically targeting the
      vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) in the mouse forebrain. Executive
      function was assessed using a pairwise visual discrimination paradigm and the
      5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRT). In the pairwise test,
      VAChT-deficient mice were able to learn, but were impaired in reversal learning, 
      suggesting that these mice present cognitive inflexibility. Interestingly,
      VAChT-targeted mice took longer to reach criteria in the 5-CSRT. Although their
      performance was indistinguishable from that of control mice during low
      attentional demand, increased attentional demand revealed striking deficits in
      VAChT-deleted mice. Galantamine, a cholinesterase inhibitor used in Alzheimer's
      disease, significantly improved the performance of control mice, but not of
      VAChT-deficient mice on the 5-CSRT. In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      showed altered levels of two neurochemical markers of neuronal function, taurine 
      and lactate, suggesting altered PFC metabolism in VAChT-deficient mice. The PFC
      of these mice displayed a drastic reduction in the splicing factor heterogeneous 
      nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNPA2/B1), whose cholinergic-mediated
      reduction was previously demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease. Consequently,
      several key hnRNPA2/B1 target transcripts involved in neuronal function present
      changes in alternative splicing in VAChT-deficient mice, including pyruvate
      kinase M, a key enzyme involved in lactate metabolism. We propose that
      VAChT-targeted mice can be used to model and to dissect the neurochemical basis
      of executive abnormalities.

      executive memory function.
PG  - 13583-99
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2427-12.2013 [doi]
AB  - In many cortical neurons, HCN1 channels are the major contributors to Ih, the
      hyperpolarization-activated current, which regulates the intrinsic properties of 
      neurons and shapes their integration of synaptic inputs, paces rhythmic activity,
      and regulates synaptic plasticity. Here, we examine the physiological role of Ih 
      in deep layer pyramidal neurons in mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), focusing on
      persistent activity, a form of sustained firing thought to be important for the
      behavioral function of the PFC during working memory tasks. We find that HCN1
      contributes to the intrinsic persistent firing that is induced by a brief
      depolarizing current stimulus in the presence of muscarinic agonists. Deletion of
      HCN1 or acute pharmacological blockade of Ih decreases the fraction of neurons
      capable of generating persistent firing. The reduction in persistent firing is
      caused by the membrane hyperpolarization that results from the deletion of HCN1
      or Ih blockade, rather than a specific role of the hyperpolarization-activated
      current in generating persistent activity. In vivo recordings show that deletion 
      of HCN1 has no effect on up states, periods of enhanced synaptic network
      activity. Parallel behavioral studies demonstrate that HCN1 contributes to the
      PFC-dependent resolution of proactive interference during working memory. These
      results thus provide genetic evidence demonstrating the importance of HCN1 to
      intrinsic persistent firing and the behavioral output of the PFC. The causal role
      of intrinsic persistent firing in PFC-mediated behavior remains an open question.

TI  - Chronic alcohol produces neuroadaptations to prime dorsal striatal learning.
PG  - 14783-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1308198110 [doi]
AB  - Drug addictions including alcoholism are characterized by degradation of
      executive control over behavior and increased compulsive drug seeking. These
      profound behavioral changes are hypothesized to involve a shift in the regulation
      of behavior from prefrontal cortex to dorsal striatum (DLS). Studies in rodents
      have shown that ethanol disrupts cognitive processes mediated by the prefrontal
      cortex, but the potential effects of chronic ethanol on DLS-mediated cognition
      and learning are much less well understood. Here, we first examined the effects
      of chronic EtOH on DLS neuronal morphology, synaptic plasticity, and
      endocannabinoid-CB1R signaling. We next tested for ethanol-induced changes in
      striatal-related learning and DLS in vivo single-unit activity during learning.
      Mice exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exhibited expansion of
      dendritic material in DLS neurons. Following CIE, DLS endocannabinoid CB1
      receptor signaling was down-regulated, and CB1 receptor-dependent long-term
      depression at DLS synapses was absent. CIE mice showed facilitation of
      DLS-dependent pairwise visual discrimination and reversal learning, relative to
      air-exposed controls. CIE mice were also quicker to extinguish a stimulus-reward 
      instrumental response and faster to reduce Pavlovian approach behavior under an
      omission schedule. In vivo single-unit recording during learning revealed that
      CIE mice had augmented DLS neuronal activity during correct responses.
      Collectively, these findings support a model in which chronic ethanol causes
      neuroadaptations in the DLS that prime for greater DLS control over learning. The
      shift to striatal dominance over behavior may be a critical step in the
      progression of alcoholism.

TI  - What does the mediodorsal thalamus do?
PG  - 37
LID - 10.3389/fnsys.2013.00037 [doi]
AB  - Dense amnesia can result from damage to the medial diencephalon in humans and in 
      animals. In humans this damage is diffuse and can include the mediodorsal nuclei 
      of the thalamus. In animal models, lesion studies have confirmed the mediodorsal 
      thalamus (MD) has a role in memory and other cognitive tasks, although the extent
      of deficits is mixed. Anatomical tracing studies confirm at least three different
      subgroupings of the MD: medial, central, and lateral, each differentially
      interconnected to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Moreover, these subgroupings of
      the MD also receive differing inputs from other brain structures, including the
      basal ganglia thus the MD subgroupings form key nodes in interconnected
      frontal-striatal-thalamic neural circuits, integrating critical information
      within the PFC. We will provide a review of data collected from non-human
      primates and rodents after selective brain injury to the whole of the MD as well 
      as these subgroupings to highlight the extent of deficits in various cognitive
      tasks. This research highlights the neural basis of memory and cognitive deficits
      associated with the subgroupings of the MD and their interconnected neural
      networks. The evidence shows that the MD plays a critical role in many varied
      cognitive processes. In addition, the MD is actively processing information and
      integrating it across these neural circuits for successful cognition. Having
      established that the MD is critical for memory and cognition, further research is
      required to understand how the MD specifically influences these cognitive
      processing carried out by the brain.

TI  - The shape of the ACC contributes to cognitive control efficiency in preschoolers.
PG  - 96-106
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00459 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive success at school and later in life is supported by executive functions
      including cognitive control (CC). The pFC plays a major role in CC, particularly 
      the dorsal part of ACC or midcingulate cortex. Genes, environment (including
      school curricula), and neuroplasticity affect CC. However, no study to date has
      investigated whether ACC sulcal pattern, a stable brain feature primarily
      determined in utero, influences CC efficiency in the early stages of cognitive
      and neural development. Using anatomical MRI and three-dimensional reconstruction
      of cortical folds, we investigated the effect that ACC sulcal pattern may have on
      the Stroop score, a classical behavioral index of CC efficiency, in 5-year-old
      preschoolers. We found higher CC efficiency, that is, lower Stroop interference
      scores for both RTs and error rates, in children with asymmetrical ACC sulcal
      pattern (i.e., different pattern in each hemisphere) compared with children with 
      symmetrical pattern (i.e., same pattern in both hemispheres). Critically, ACC
      sulcal pattern had no effect on performance in the forward and backward digit
      span tasks suggesting that ACC sulcal pattern contributes to the executive
      ability to resolve conflicts but not to the ability to maintain and manipulate
      information in working memory. This finding provides the first evidence that
      preschoolers' CC efficiency is likely associated with ACC sulcal pattern, thereby
      suggesting that the brain shape could result in early constraints on human
      executive ability.

      first-person content reports.
PG  - 412
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2013.00412 [doi]
AB  - Isolated reports have long suggested a similarity in content and thought
      processes across mind wandering (MW) during waking, and dream mentation during
      sleep. This overlap has encouraged speculation that both "daydreaming" and
      dreaming may engage similar brain mechanisms. To explore this possibility, we
      systematically examined published first-person experiential reports of MW and
      dreaming and found many similarities: in both states, content is largely
      audiovisual and emotional, follows loose narratives tinged with fantasy, is
      strongly related to current concerns, draws on long-term memory, and simulates
      social interactions. Both states are also characterized by a relative lack of
      meta-awareness. To relate first-person reports to neural evidence, we compared
      meta-analytic data from numerous functional neuroimaging (PET, fMRI) studies of
      the default mode network (DMN, with high chances of MW) and rapid eye movement
      (REM) sleep (with high chances of dreaming). Our findings show large overlaps in 
      activation patterns of cortical regions: similar to MW/DMN activity, dreaming and
      REM sleep activate regions implicated in self-referential thought and memory,
      including medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), medial temporal lobe structures, and
      posterior cingulate. Conversely, in REM sleep numerous PFC executive regions are 
      deactivated, even beyond levels seen during waking MW. We argue that dreaming can
      be understood as an "intensified" version of waking MW: though the two share many
      similarities, dreams tend to be longer, more visual and immersive, and to more
      strongly recruit numerous key hubs of the DMN. Further, whereas MW recruits fewer
      PFC regions than goal-directed thought, dreaming appears to be characterized by
      an even deeper quiescence of PFC regions involved in cognitive control and
      metacognition, with a corresponding lack of insight and meta-awareness. We
      suggest, then, that dreaming amplifies the same features that distinguish MW from
      goal-directed waking thought.

AB  - Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to reduce acute
      substance craving in drug addicts, and improve cognition in neuropsychiatric
      patients. Here we aimed to explore further tDCS induced behavioral and
      neurophysiological modulation including assessment of relapse rate over a
      prolonged time course in alcoholism. We examined the effects of repeated anodal
      tDCS (2mA, 35 cm(2), 20min) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 
      on relapse to the use of alcohol in alcoholics from outpatient services, who
      received additional routine clinical treatment. Furthermore, event related
      potentials (ERPs), cognitive and frontal executive processes, craving, depressive
      and anxiety symptoms were obtained before and after treatment. From thirteen
      alcoholic subjects, seven were randomized to sham-tDCS and six to real tDCS
      treatment (once a week for five consecutive weeks). Depressive symptoms and
      craving were reduced to a larger extent in the tDCS group compared to the sham
      group (p=0.005 and p=0.015, respectively). On the other hand, active tDCS was
      able to block the increase in neural activation triggered by alcohol related and 
      neutral cues in prefrontal cortex (PFC) as indexed by ERP as seen in the
      sham-tDCS group. Finally, there was a trend for increased change in executive
      function in the tDCS group compared to the sham-tDCS group (p=0.082), and,
      similarly, a trend for more relapses in the tDCS group compared to sham tDCS
      (four alcoholic subjects (66.7%) vs. one (14.3%), p=0.053).These results confirm 
      the previous findings of tDCS effects on craving in alcoholism and also extend
      these findings as we showed also tDCS-related mood improvement. However,
      potential increase in relapse is possible; thus the clinical value of an increase
      in craving and improvement in depression and executive function needs to be
      carefully assessed in further studies; including investigation of optimal
      parameters of stimulation.

TI  - Probing the frontostriatal loops involved in executive and limbic processing via 
      interleaved TMS and functional MRI at two prefrontal locations: a pilot study.
PG  - e67917
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0067917 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is an anatomically and functionally
      heterogeneous area which influences cognitive and limbic processing through
      connectivity to subcortical targets. As proposed by Alexander et al. (1986) the
      lateral and medial aspects of the PFC project to distinct areas of the striatum
      in parallel but functionally distinct circuits. The purpose of this preliminary
      study was to determine if we could differentially and consistently activate these
      lateral and medial cortical-subcortical circuits involved in executive and limbic
      processing though interleaved transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the MR
      environment. METHODS: Seventeen healthy individuals received interleaved TMS-BOLD
      imaging with the coil positioned over the dorsolateral (EEG: F3) and ventromedial
      PFC (EEG: FP1). BOLD signal change was calculated in the areas directly
      stimulated by the coil and in subcortical regions with afferent and efferent
      connectivity to the TMS target areas. Additionally, five individuals were tested 
      on two occasions to determine test-retest reliability. RESULTS: Region of
      interest analysis revealed that TMS at both prefrontal sites led to significant
      BOLD signal increases in the cortex under the coil, in the striatum, and the
      thalamus, but not in the visual cortex (negative control region). There was a
      significantly larger BOLD signal change in the caudate following medial PFC TMS, 
      relative to lateral TMS. The hippocampus in contrast was significantly more
      activated by lateral TMS. Post-hoc voxel-based analysis revealed that within the 
      caudate the location of peak activity was in the ventral caudate following medial
      TMS and the dorsal caudate following lateral TMS. Test-retest reliability data
      revealed consistent BOLD responses to TMS within each individual but a large
      variation between individuals. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that, through
      an optimized TMS/BOLD sequence over two unique prefrontal targets, it is possible
      to selectively interrogate the patency of these established cortical-subcortical 
      networks in healthy individuals, and potentially patient populations.

AB  - Adolescence is characterized behaviorally by increased impulsivity and
      risk-taking that declines in parallel with maturation of the prefrontal cortex
      and executive function. In the brain, the receptor for advanced glycation end
      products (RAGE) is critically involved in neurodevelopment and neuropathology. In
      humans, the risk of alcoholism is greatly increased in those who begin drinking
      between 13 and 15years of age, and adolescents binge drink more than any other
      age group. We have previously found that alcoholism is associated with increased 
      expression of neuroimmune genes. This manuscript tested the hypothesis that
      adolescent binge drinking upregulates RAGE and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 as well
      as their endogenous agonist, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1).
      Immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and mRNA analyses found that RAGE expression 
      was increased in the human post-mortem alcoholic orbitofrontal cortex (OFC).
      Further, an earlier age of drinking onset correlated with increased expression of
      RAGE, TLR4, and HMGB1. To determine if alcohol contributed to these changes, we
      used an adolescent binge ethanol model in rats (5.0g/kg, i.g., 2-day on/2-day off
      from postnatal day [P] 25 to P55) and assessed neuroimmune gene expression. We
      found an age-associated decline of RAGE expression from late adolescence (P56) to
      young adulthood (P80). Adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure did not alter
      RAGE expression at P56, but increased RAGE in the young adult PFC (P80).
      Adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure also increased TLR4 and HMGB1 expression
      at P56 that persisted into young adulthood (P80). Assessment of young adult
      frontal cortex mRNA (RT-PCR) found increased expression of proinflammatory
      cytokines, oxidases, and neuroimmune agonists at P80, 25days after ethanol
      treatment. Together, these human and animal data support the hypothesis that an
      early age of drinking onset upregulates RAGE/TLR4-HMGB1 and other neuroimmune
      genes that persist into young adulthood and could contribute to risk of
      alcoholism or other brain diseases associated with neuroinflammation.

AB  - Semantic cognition requires a combination of semantic representations and
      executive control processes to direct activation in a task- and time-appropriate 
      fashion [Jefferies, E., & Lambon Ralph, M. A. Semantic impairment in stroke
      aphasia versus semantic dementia: A case-series comparison. Brain, 129,
      2132-2147, 2006]. We undertook a formal meta-analysis to investigate which
      regions within the large-scale semantic network are specifically associated with 
      the executive component of semantic cognition. Previous studies have described in
      detail the role of left ventral pFC in semantic regulation. We examined 53
      studies that contrasted semantic tasks with high > low executive requirements to 
      determine whether cortical regions beyond the left pFC show the same response
      profile to executive semantic demands. Our findings revealed that right pFC,
      posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) and dorsal angular gyrus (bordering
      intraparietal sulcus) were also consistently recruited by executively demanding
      semantic tasks, demonstrating patterns of activation that were highly similar to 
      the left ventral pFC. These regions overlap with the lesions in aphasic patients 
      who exhibit multimodal semantic impairment because of impaired regulatory control
      (semantic aphasia)-providing important convergence between functional
      neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies of semantic cognition. Activation in 
      dorsal angular gyrus and left ventral pFC was consistent across all types of
      executive semantic manipulation, regardless of whether the task was receptive or 
      expressive, whereas pMTG activation was only observed for manipulation of control
      demands within receptive tasks. Second, we contrasted executively demanding tasks
      tapping semantics and phonology. Our findings revealed substantial overlap
      between the two sets of contrasts within left ventral pFC, suggesting this region
      underpins domain-general control mechanisms. In contrast, we observed relative
      specialization for semantic control within pMTG as well as the most ventral
      aspects of left pFC (BA 47), consistent with our proposal of a distributed
      network underpinning semantic control.

AB  - In many circumstances alternative courses of action and thoughts have to be
      inhibited to allow the emergence of goal-directed behavior. However, this has not
      been the accepted view in the past and only recently has inhibition earned its
      own place in the neurosciences as a fundamental cognitive function. In this
      review we first introduce the concept of inhibition from early psychological
      speculations based on philosophical theories of the human mind. The broad
      construct of inhibition is then reduced to its most readily observable component 
      which necessarily is its behavioral manifestation. The study of 'response
      inhibition' has the advantage of dealing with a relatively simple and
      straightforward process, the overriding of a planned or already initiated action.
      Deficient inhibitory processes profoundly affect everyday life, causing impulsive
      conduct which is generally detrimental for the individual. Impulsivity has been
      consistently linked to several types of addiction, attention
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mania and other psychiatric conditions. Our
      discussion of the behavioral assessment of impulsivity will focus on objective
      laboratory tasks of response inhibition that have been implemented in parallel
      for humans and other species with relatively few qualitative differences. The
      translational potential of these measures has greatly improved our knowledge of
      the neurobiological basis of behavioral inhibition and impulsivity. We will then 
      review the current models of behavioral inhibition along with their expression
      via underlying brain regions, including those involved in the activation of the
      brain's emergency 'brake' operation, those engaged in more controlled and
      sustained inhibitory processes and other ancillary executive functions.

AB  - The proverb interpretation task (PIT) is often used in clinical settings to
      evaluate frontal "executive" dysfunction. However, only a relatively small number
      of studies have investigated the relationship between frontal lobe lesions and
      performance on the PIT. We compared 52 patients with unselected focal frontal
      lobe lesions with 52 closely matched healthy controls on a proverb interpretation
      task. Participants also completed a battery of neuropsychological tests,
      including a fluid intelligence task (Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices).
      Lesions were firstly analysed according to a standard left/right sub-division.
      Secondly, a finer-grained analysis compared the performance of patients with
      medial, left lateral and right lateral lesions with healthy controls. Thirdly, a 
      contrast of specific frontal subgroups compared the performance of patients with 
      medial lesions with patients with lateral frontal lesions. The results showed
      that patients with left frontal lesions were significantly impaired on the PIT,
      while in patients with right frontal lesions the impairments approached
      significance. Medial frontal patients were the only frontal subgroup impaired on 
      the PIT, relative to healthy controls and lateral frontal patients.
      Interestingly, an error analysis indicated that a significantly higher number of 
      concrete responses were found in the left lateral subgroup compared to healthy
      controls. We found no correlation between scores on the PIT and on the fluid
      intelligence task. Overall our results suggest that specific regions of the
      frontal lobes contribute to the performance on the PIT.

TI  - Benefits of physical exercise on the aging brain: the role of the prefrontal
      cortex.
PG  - 1337-41
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glt094 [doi]
AB  - Motor planning in older adults likely relies on the overengagement of the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) and is associated with slowness of movement and
      responses. Does a physically active lifestyle counteract the overrecruitment of
      the PFC during action preparation? This study used high-resolution
      electroencephalography to measure the effect of physical exercise on the
      executive functions of the PFC preceding a visuomotor discriminative task. A
      total of 130 participants aged 15-86 were divided into two groups based on
      physical exercise participation. The response times and accuracy and the premotor
      activity of the PFC were separately correlated with age for the two groups. The
      data were first fit with a linear function and then a higher order polynomial
      function. We observed that after 35-40 years of age, physically active
      individuals have faster response times than their less active peers and showed no
      signs of PFC hyperactivity during motor planning. The present findings show that 
      physical exercise could speed up the response of older people and reveal that
      also in middle-aged people, moderate-to-high levels of physical exercise benefits
      the planning/execution of a response and the executive functions mediated by the 
      PFC, counteracting the neural overactivity often observed in the elderly adults.

LID - 10.3892/mmr.2013.1564 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive performance in healthy individuals is associated with gender
      differences in specific tests; a female advantage has been demonstrated in
      language tests, whereas a male advantage has been demonstrated in spatial
      relation examinations. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediates important cognitive
      domains and is influenced by dopamine (DA) activity. The single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) rs4680 in the catecholOmethyltransferase (COMT) gene results
      in an amino acid substitution from valine (Val) to methionine (Met). The Met
      allele has been demonstrated to decrease COMT enzyme activity and improve PFC
      cognitive function. COMT regulates DA activity in the PFC and exhibits gender
      effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the genderspecific
      effects of the COMT genotype on cognition in healthy young adults. Seventysix
      healthy subjects were genotyped for COMT rs4680 and submitted to an extensive
      range of neuropsychological tests assessing aspects of PFC function. The COMT Met
      allele influenced the performance of executive function. The results revealed
      gender effects of the COMT rs4680 Met allele on verbal fluency, with positive
      effects in males and negative effects in females. This suggested that DA activity
      affects cognitive function in different ways, according to gender.

TI  - Executive functioning in schizophrenia.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00035 [doi]
AB  - The executive function (EF) is a set of abilities, which allows us to invoke
      voluntary control of our behavioral responses. These functions enable human
      beings to develop and carry out plans, make up analogies, obey social rules,
      solve problems, adapt to unexpected circumstances, do many tasks simultaneously, 
      and locate episodes in time and place. EF includes divided attention and
      sustained attention, working memory (WM), set-shifting, flexibility, planning,
      and the regulation of goal directed behavior and can be defined as a brain
      function underlying the human faculty to act or think not only in reaction to
      external events but also in relation with internal goals and states. EF is mostly
      associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Besides EF, PFC is involved
      in self-regulation of behavior, i.e., the ability to regulate behavior according 
      to internal goals and constraints, particularly in less structured situations.
      Self-regulation of behavior is subtended by ventral medial/orbital PFC.
      Impairment of EF is one of the most commonly observed deficits in schizophrenia
      through the various disease stages. Impairment in tasks measuring
      conceptualization, planning, cognitive flexibility, verbal fluency, ability to
      solve complex problems, and WM occur in schizophrenia. Disorders detected by
      executive tests are consistent with evidence from functional neuroimaging, which 
      have shown PFC dysfunction in patients while performing these kinds of tasks.
      Schizophrenics also exhibit deficit in odor identifying, decision-making, and
      self-regulation of behavior suggesting dysfunction of the orbital PFC. However,
      impairment in executive tests is explained by dysfunction of
      prefronto-striato-thalamic, prefronto-parietal, and prefronto-temporal neural
      networks mainly. Disorders in EFs may be considered central facts with respect to
      schizophrenia and it has been suggested that negative symptoms may be explained
      by that executive dysfunction.

TI  - Heroin abuse accelerates biological aging: a novel insight from telomerase and
      brain imaging interaction.
PG  - e260
LID - 10.1038/tp.2013.36 [doi]
AB  - Heroin abuse and natural aging exert common influences on immunological cell
      functioning. This observation led to a recent and untested idea that aging may be
      accelerated in abusers of heroin. We examined this claim by testing whether
      heroin use is associated with premature aging at both cellular and brain system
      levels. A group of abstinent heroin users (n=33) and matched healthy controls
      (n=30) were recruited and measured on various biological indicators of aging.
      These measures included peripheral blood telomerase activity, which reflects
      cellular aging, and both structural and functional measures of brain magnetic
      resonance imaging. We found that heroin users were characterized by significantly
      low telomerase activity (0.21 vs 1.78; 88% reduction; t(61)=6.96, P<0.001; 95%
      confidence interval=1.12-2.02), which interacted with heroin use to affect the
      structural integrity of gray and white matter of the prefrontal cortex (PFC;
      AlphaSim corrected P<0.05), a key brain region implicated in aging. Using the PFC
      location identified from the structural analyses as a 'seed' region, it was
      further revealed that telomerase activity interacted with heroin use to impact
      age-sensitive brain functional networks (AlphaSim corrected P<0.05), which
      correlated with behavioral performance on executive functioning, memory and
      attentional control (Pearson correlation, all P<0.05). To our knowledge, this
      study is the first to attempt a direct integration of peripheral molecular, brain
      system and behavioral measures in the context of substance abuse. The present
      finding that heroin abuse is associated with accelerated aging at both cellular
      and brain system levels is novel and forms a unique contribution to our knowledge
      in how the biological processes of drug abusers may be disrupted.

      stimuli.
PG  - 917-23
LID - 10.1093/scan/nst070 [doi]
AB  - Besides food restriction, hyperactivity is considered a key behavioral trait of
      anorexia nervosa (AN), playing a major role in the pathogenesis and progression
      of the disorder. However, the underlying neurophysiology remains poorly
      understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging during two affective
      go/no-go tasks to probe inhibitory control in response to stimuli depicting
      physical activity vs inactivity and food vs non-food in AN patients compared with
      26 healthy athlete and non-athlete controls. We hypothesized that neural
      correlates of behavioral inhibition are biased by the emotional information of
      the stimuli in AN patients, leading to a differential neural inhibitory pattern
      during the two tasks. Indeed, we found reduced response inhibition for food and
      non-food images in the putamen, while stimuli depicting physical activity
      resulted in an exaggerated response of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and cerebellum
      in AN patients. However, both AN patients and athletes revealed an increased
      response in the somatosensory cortex to physical activity stimuli. These results 
      suggest that physical activity stimuli might place an increased demand on the
      inhibitory control system in AN patients. The resulting hyperactivity of the PFC 
      and cerebellum may lead to altered executive function and motor control,
      sustaining increased physical activity in AN patients.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is responsible for integrating cortical and
      subcortical inputs to execute essential cognitive functions such as attention,
      working memory planning and decision-making. The importance of this brain region 
      in regulating complex cognitive processes is underscored by a decline in
      PFC-mediated ability observed in aging and disease. The cholinergic system plays 
      a vital role in cognitive function and treatments (e.g., cholinesterase
      inhibitors) to improve cholinergic neurotransmission provide the standard-of-care
      for diseases such as Alzheimer's. Nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) are a primary site
      of action for acetylcholine (ACh), and the resulting pro-cognitive effects
      observed by stimulating nAChRs with nicotine has long been appreciated by tobacco
      users, prompting investigation of therapeutic development for diseases (e.g.,
      schizophrenia, Alzheimer or attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder) by
      targeting the neuronal nAChR system. Noteworthy, improvements in attention,
      working memory and executive processes mediated by the PFC have been reported
      following nicotinic agonist exposure. Relevance of these ligand gated channels in
      higher brain function is further supported by the association of cognitive
      deficits reported in humans with mutations in CHRNB2 or CHRNA7 the genes encoding
      for the nicotinic receptor beta2 and alpha7 subunits, respectively. In this work 
      we review, in light of the latest findings, how nicotinic agonists may be acting 
      in the PFC to influence cognitive function.

      toward a family of functions.

AB  - Studies on prefrontal cortex (PFC) dopamine (DA) function have revealed its
      essential role in mediating a variety of cognitive and executive functions. A
      general principle that has emerged (primarily from studies on working memory) is 
      that PFC DA, acting on D1 receptors, regulates cognition in accordance to an
      "inverted-U" shaped function, so that too little or too much activity has
      detrimental effects on performance. However, contemporary studies have indicated 
      that the receptor mechanisms through which mesocortical DA regulates different
      aspects of behavioral flexibility can vary considerably across different DA
      receptors and cognitive operations. This article will review
      psychopharmacological and neurochemical data comparing and contrasting the
      cognitive effects of antagonism and stimulation of different DA receptors in the 
      medial PFC. Thus, set-shifting is dependent on a co-operative interaction between
      PFC D1 and D2 receptors, yet, supranormal stimulation of these receptors does not
      appear to have detrimental effects on this function. On the other hand,
      modification of cost/benefit decision biases in situations involving reward
      uncertainty is regulated in complex and sometimes opposing ways by PFC D1 vs. D2 
      receptors. When viewed collectively, these findings suggest that the "inverted-U"
      shaped dose-response curve underlying D1 receptor modulation of working memory is
      not a one-size-fits-all function. Rather, it appears that mesocortical DA exerts 
      its effects via a family of functions, wherein reduced or excessive DA activity
      can have a variety of effects across different cognitive domains.

PG  - 2430-5
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bht095 [doi]
AB  - The capacity to inhibit inappropriate responses is crucial for goal-directed
      behavior. Inhibiting such responses seems to come more easily to some of us than 
      others, however. From where do these individual differences originate? Here, we
      measured 263 participants' neural baseline activation using resting
      electroencephalogram. Then, we used this stable neural marker to predict a
      reliable electrophysiological index of response inhibition capacity in the cued
      Continuous Performance Test, the NoGo-Anteriorization (NGA). Using a
      source-localization technique, we found that resting delta, theta, and alpha1
      activity in the left middle frontal gyrus and resting alpha1 activity in the
      right inferior frontal gyrus were negatively correlated with the NGA. As a larger
      NGA is thought to represent better response inhibition capacity, our findings
      demonstrate that lower levels of resting slow-wave oscillations in the lateral
      prefrontal cortex, bilaterally, are associated with a better response inhibition 
      capacity.

      the prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 123
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2013.00123 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms and neural circuits that drive emotion and cognition are
      inextricably linked. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
      as a result of stress or other causes of arousal initiates a flood of hormone and
      neurotransmitter release throughout the brain, affecting the way we think,
      decide, and behave. This review will focus on factors that influence the function
      of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region that governs higher-level
      cognitive processes and executive function. The PFC becomes markedly impaired by 
      stress, producing measurable deficits in working memory. These deficits arise
      from the interaction of multiple neuromodulators, including glucocorticoids,
      catecholamines, and gonadal hormones; here we will discuss the non-human primate 
      and rodent literature that has furthered our understanding of the circuitry,
      receptors, and signaling cascades responsible for stress-induced prefrontal
      dysfunction.

TI  - Diffusion weighted imaging of prefrontal cortex in prodromal Huntington's
      disease.
PG  - 1562-73
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22273 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with no
      effective disease-modifying treatments. There is considerable interest in finding
      reliable indicators of disease progression to judge the efficacy of novel
      treatments that slow or stop disease onset before debilitating signs appear.
      Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) may provide a reliable marker of disease
      progression by characterizing diffusivity changes in white matter (WM) in
      individuals with prodromal HD. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) may play a role in HD 
      progression due to its prominent striatal connections and documented role in
      executive function. This study uses DWI to characterize diffusivity in specific
      regions of PFC WM defined by FreeSurfer in 53 prodromal HD participants and 34
      controls. Prodromal HD individuals were separated into three CAG-Age Product
      (CAP) groups (16 low, 22 medium, 15 high) that indexed baseline progression.
      Statistically significant increases in mean diffusivity (MD) and radial
      diffusivity (RD) among CAP groups relative to controls were seen in inferior and 
      lateral PFC regions. For MD and RD, differences among controls and HD
      participants tracked with baseline disease progression. The smallest difference
      was for the low group and the largest for the high group. Significant
      correlations between Trail Making Test B (TMTB) and mean fractional anisotropy
      (FA) and/or RD paralleled group differences in mean MD and/or RD in several right
      hemisphere regions. The gradient of effects that tracked with CAP group suggests 
      DWI may provide markers of disease progression in future longitudinal studies as 
      increasing diffusivity abnormalities in the lateral PFC of prodromal HD
      individuals.

TI  - Prefrontal cortex organization: dissociating effects of temporal abstraction,
      relational abstraction, and integration with FMRI.

AB  - The functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) underlie higher-level cognition.
      Varying proposals suggest that the PFC is organized along a rostral-caudal
      gradient of abstraction with more abstract representations/processes associated
      with more rostral areas. However, the operational definition of abstraction is
      unclear. Here, we contrasted 2 prominent theories of abstraction--temporal and
      relational--using fMRI. We further examined whether integrating abstract rules--a
      function common to each theory--recruited the PFC independently of other
      abstraction effects. While robust effects of relational abstraction were present 
      in the PFC, temporal abstraction effects were absent. Instead, we found
      activations specific to the integration of relational rules in areas previously
      shown to be associated with temporal abstraction. We suggest that previous
      effects of temporal abstraction were due to confounds with integration demands.
      We propose an integration framework to understand the functions of the PFC that
      resolves discrepancies in prior data.

LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00391 [doi]
AB  - Previous research has highlighted brain regions associated with socioemotional
      processes in persuasive message encoding, whereas cognitive models of persuasion 
      suggest that executive brain areas may also be important. The current study aimed
      to identify lateral prefrontal brain areas associated with persuasive message
      viewing and understand how activity in these executive regions might interact
      with activity in the amygdala and medial pFC. Seventy adolescents were scanned
      using fMRI while they watched 10 strongly convincing antidrug public service
      announcements (PSAs), 10 weakly convincing antidrug PSAs, and 10 advertisements
      (ads) unrelated to drugs. Antidrug PSAs compared with nondrug ads more strongly
      elicited arousal-related activity in the amygdala and medial pFC. Within antidrug
      PSAs, those that were prerated as strongly persuasive versus weakly persuasive
      showed significant differences in arousal-related activity in executive
      processing areas of the lateral pFC. In support of the notion that persuasiveness
      involves both affective and executive processes, functional connectivity analyses
      showed greater coactivation between the lateral pFC and amygdala during PSAs
      known to be strongly (vs. weakly) convincing. These findings demonstrate that
      persuasive messages elicit activation in brain regions responsible for both
      emotional arousal and executive control and represent a crucial step toward a
      better understanding of the neural processes responsible for persuasion and
      subsequent behavior change.

TI  - The roles of reward, default, and executive control networks in set-shifting
      impairments in schizophrenia.
PG  - e57257
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0057257 [doi]
AB  - Patients with schizophrenia (SZ) show deficits on tasks of rapid reinforcement
      learning, like probabilistic reversal learning (PRL), but the neural bases for
      those impairments are not known. Recent evidence of relatively intact sensitivity
      to negative outcomes in the ventral striatum (VS) in many SZ patients suggests
      that PRL deficits may be largely attributable to processes downstream from
      feedback processing, involving both the activation of executive control task
      regions and deactivation of default mode network (DMN) components. We analyzed
      data from 29 chronic SZ patients and 21 matched normal controls (NCs) performing 
      a PRL task in an MRI scanner. Subjects were presented with eight pairs of fractal
      stimuli, for 50 trials each. For each pair, subjects learned to choose the more
      frequently-rewarded (better) stimulus. Each time a criterion was reached, the
      better stimulus became the worse one, and the worse became the better. Responses 
      to feedback events were assessed through whole-brain and regions-of-interest
      (ROI) analyses in DMN. We also assessed correlations between BOLD signal
      contrasts and clinical measures in SZs. Relative to NCs, SZ patients showed
      comparable deactivation of VS in response to negative feedback, but reduced
      deactivation of DMN components including medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The
      magnitudes of patients' punishment-evoked deactivations in VS and ventromedial
      PFC correlated significantly with clinical ratings for avolition/anhedonia. These
      findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to
      deactivate components of default mode networks, following the presentation of
      informative feedback and that motivational deficits in SZ relate closely to
      feedback-evoked activity in reward circuit components. These results also confirm
      a role for ventrolateral and dorsomedial PFC in the execution of response-set
      shifts.

AB  - Cognitive impairment is one of the major symptoms of schizophrenia, and is
      considered largely due to dysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
      Lurasidone, a novel atypical antipsychotic agent with high binding affinity for
      dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT7, 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors has been reported to
      have superior efficacy in rodents' models of cognitive impairment. However, the
      beneficial effect of lurasidone on cognitive impairment has not been evaluated in
      non-human primates. In this study, we investigated the effect of lurasidone on
      executive function, which is one of the cognitive domains, in common marmosets
      and compared the results to those of other antipsychotics. The effects of
      lurasidone, haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and clozapine on
      executive function were evaluated in naive marmosets using the object retrieval
      with detours (ORD) task. Before drug treatment, marmosets' success rates in the
      easy trial of the test were almost 90%. However, maximum success in the difficult
      trial of the task reached only 50% after 8 days of training. Haloperidol,
      olanzapine and risperidone decreased correct performance even in the easy trial
      of the task. All drugs, except lurasidone, impaired success rate in the difficult
      trial. On the other hand, lurasidone dose-dependently increased marmosets'
      success rates in the difficult trial with significant effect at 10mg/kg. In
      conclusion, we have shown in this study that lurasidone, unlike conventional
      antipsychotics, improves cognition associated with executive function in common
      marmosets. These findings suggest that lurasidone would be more useful for
      treatment of schizophrenia cognitive impairment than other antipsychotics.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) is considered to be an important neurotransmitter in the control of
      impulsive behavior, however, its underlying mechanisms have not been fully
      elucidated. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a key enzyme in the catabolism
      of DA within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and has been suggested to play a role in
      the mediation of impulsive behavior. The COMT single nucleotide polymorphism
      (SNP) rs4680 (Val158Met) Met allele has been shown to decrease COMT enzyme
      activity and is associated with improved PFC cognitive function (intelligence and
      executive functions). Studies have associated the rs4680 genotype with
      impulsivity as a symptom in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and
      substance abuse. However, only a few studies have assessed the effects of rs4680 
      on impulsiveness in healthy subjects, the results of which remain controversial. 
      The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) was applied to 82 healthy volunteers
      (including 42 females) who were genotyped for COMT rs4680. Subjects carrying the 
      Met/Met genotype scored higher for the BIS-11 second-order factor Non-planning
      than carriers of the Val/Val genotype. No interaction between gender genotype was
      detected. Age, gender and education had no effect on the results. The COMT rs4680
      Met/Met genotype was associated with higher impulsivity on the BIS-11
      second-order factor Non-planning. These results suggest that COMT enzyme activity
      may be important in the regulation of impulsiveness among young adults. Further
      studies involving larger samples should be conducted to confirm the results of
      the present study.

AB  - Failure of executive function (EF) is a core symptom of
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, various results have
      been reported and sufficient evidence is lacking. In the present study, we
      evaluated the characteristics of children with ADHD using the Stroop task (ST)
      and reverse Stroop task (RST) that reflects the inhibition function of EF. We
      compared children with ADHD, typically developing children (TDC), and children
      with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is more difficult to discriminate from
      ADHD. A total of 10 children diagnosed with ADHD, 15 TDC, and 11 children
      diagnosed with ASD, all matched by age, sex, language ability, and intelligence
      quotient, participated in this study. While each subject performed computer-based
      ST and RST with a touch panel, changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) were
      measured in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to
      correlate test performance with neural activity. Behavioral performance
      significantly differed among 3 groups during RST but not during ST. The ADHD
      group showed greater color interference than the TDC group. In addition, there
      was a negative correlation between right lateral PFC (LPFC) activity and the
      severity of attention deficit. Children with ADHD exhibit several problems
      associated with inhibition of color, and this symptom is affected by low
      activities of the right LPFC. In addition, it is suggested that low hemodynamic
      activities in this area are correlated with ADHD.

AB  - While the hippocampal formation and the prefrontal cortex each have a
      well-established role in cognitive and mnemonic processes, the extent and manner 
      in which these structures interact to achieve these functions has not been fully 
      delineated. Recent research in rodents compellingly supports the idea that the
      projection of neurons extending from the CA1 region of the hippocampus and from
      the subiculum to the prefrontal cortex, referred to here as the H-PFC pathway, is
      critically involved in aspects of cognition related to executive function and to 
      emotional regulation. Concurrently, it is becoming evident that persons suffering
      from schizophrenia, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder display
      structural anomalies and aberrant functional coupling within the
      hippocampal-prefrontal circuit. Considering that these disorders involve varying 
      degrees of cognitive impairment and emotional dysregulation, dysfunction in the
      H-PFC pathway might therefore be the common element of their pathophysiology.
      This overlap might also be intertwined with the pathway's evident susceptibility 
      to stress and with its relationship to the amygdala. In consequence, the H-PFC
      pathway is a potentially crucial element of the pathophysiology of several
      psychiatric diseases, and it offers a specific target for therapeutic
      intervention, which is consistent with the recent emphasis on reframing
      psychiatric diseases in terms of brain circuits.

      younger and older adults.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/1471-2202-14-10 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine task-related changes in
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity during a dual-task in both healthy young and
      older adults and compare patterns of activation between the age groups. We also
      sought to determine whether brain activation during a dual-task relates to
      executive/attentional function and how measured factors associated with both of
      these functions vary between older and younger adults. RESULTS: Thirty-five
      healthy volunteers (20 young and 15 elderly) participated in this study.
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was employed to measure PFC activation during a
      single-task (performing calculations or stepping) and dual-task (performing both 
      single-tasks at once). Cognitive function was assessed in the older patients with
      the Trail-making test part B (TMT-B). Major outcomes were task performance, brain
      activation during task (oxygenated haemoglobin: Oxy-Hb) measured by NIRS, and
      TMT-B score. Mixed ANOVAs were used to compare task factors and age groups in
      task performance. Mixed ANOVAs also compared task factors, age group and time
      factors in task-induced changes in measured Oxy-Hb. Among the older participants,
      correlations between the TMT-B score and Oxy-Hb values measured in each
      single-task and in the dual-task were examined using a Pearson correlation
      coefficient.Oxy-Hb values were significantly increased in both the calculation
      task and the dual-task within patients in both age groups. However, the Oxy-Hb
      values associated with there were higher in the older group during the post-task 
      period for the dual-task. Also, there were significant negative correlations
      between both task-performance accuracy and Oxy-Hb values during the dual-task and
      participant TMT-B scores. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults demonstrated age-specific PFC
      activation in response to dual-task challenge. There was also a significant
      negative correlation between PFC activation during dual-task and
      executive/attentional function. These findings suggest that the high cognitive
      load induced by dual-task activity generates increased PFC activity in older
      adults. However, this relationship appeared to be strongest in participants with 
      better baseline attention and executive functions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation has shed new light on the central role of the 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). We explored this 
      structure from a functional perspective, synchronizing neuroimaging and cognitive
      measures. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This case-control cross-sectional study compared 
      15 OCD patients without comorbidities and not currently on serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors or cognitive behavioural therapy with 15 healthy controls (matched for
      age, sex and education level) on resting-state (18)FDG-PET scans and a
      neuropsychological battery assessing executive functions. We looked for
      correlations between metabolic modifications and impaired neuropsychological
      scores. Modifications in glucose metabolism were found in frontal regions
      (orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral cortices), the cingulate gyrus, insula and
      parietal gyrus. Neuropsychological differences between patients and controls,
      which were subtle, were correlated with the metabolism of the prefrontal,
      parietal, and temporal cortices. CONCLUSION: As expected, we confirmed previous
      reports of a PFC dysfunction in OCD patients, and established a correlation with 
      cognitive deficits. Other regions outside the prefrontal cortex, including the
      dorsoparietal cortex and the insula, also appeared to be implicated in the
      pathophysiology of OCD, providing fresh insights on the complexity of OCD
      syndromes.

TI  - Altered cerebral response during cognitive control: a potential indicator of
      genetic liability for schizophrenia.
PG  - 846-53
LID - 10.1038/npp.2012.250 [doi]
AB  - Aberrant activity in brain regions underlying various aspects of executive
      cognition has been reported in patients with schizophrenia and in their healthy
      relatives, suggesting an association with genetic liability. The aim of this
      study was to investigate brain responses to selective aspects of cognitive
      control in unaffected siblings who are at increased genetic risk of
      schizophrenia. Altogether, 65 non-affected siblings, 70 patients with
      schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and 235 normal controls participated in this
      study. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging was
      conducted while participants performed a cognitive control task ('flanker task') 
      to identify brain activity and connectivity associated with response inhibition
      and conflict monitoring, and suppression. Behaviorally, similar to patients with 
      schizophrenia, siblings were less accurate when inhibiting prepotent responses
      relative to normal controls. During response inhibition, again similar to
      patients with schizophrenia, siblings showed decreased activity in the anterior
      cingulate (ACC), along with increased functional coupling with the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) when compared to normal controls. Our findings show
      altered ACC activity and PFC connectivity in unaffected siblings and patients
      with schizophrenia during response inhibition. These results suggest that such
      changes in the neural activity underlying aspects of cognitive control may
      represent a potential intermediate phenotype for the investigation of the genetic
      basis of schizophrenia.

TI  - Selective presynaptic enhancement of the prefrontal cortex to nucleus accumbens
      pathway by cocaine.
PG  - 713-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1206287110 [doi]
AB  - The nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulates motivated behavior by, in part, processing 
      excitatory synaptic projections from several brain regions. Among these regions, 
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and basolateral amygdala, convey executive control
      and affective states, respectively. Whereas glutamatergic synaptic transmission
      within the NAc has been recognized as a primary cellular target for cocaine and
      other drugs of abuse to induce addiction-related pathophysiological motivational 
      states, the understanding has been thus far limited to drug-induced postsynaptic 
      alterations. It remains elusive whether exposure to cocaine or other drugs of
      abuse influences presynaptic functions of these excitatory projections, and if
      so, in which projection pathways. Using optogenetic methods combined with
      biophysical assays, we demonstrate that the presynaptic release probability (Pr) 
      of the PFC-to-NAc synapses was enhanced after short-term withdrawal (1 d) and
      long-term (45 d) withdrawal from either noncontingent (i.p. injection) or
      contingent (self-administration) exposure to cocaine. After long-term withdrawal 
      of contingent drug exposure, the Pr was higher compared with i.p. injected rats. 
      In contrast, within the basolateral amygdala afferents, presynaptic Pr was not
      significantly altered in any of these experimental conditions. Thus,
      cocaine-induced procedure- and pathway-specific presynaptic enhancement of
      excitatory synaptic transmission in the NAc. These results, together with
      previous findings of cocaine-induced postsynaptic enhancement, suggest an
      increased PFC-to-NAc shell glutamatergic synaptic transmission after withdrawal
      from exposure to cocaine. This presynaptic alteration may interact with other
      cocaine-induced cellular adaptations to shift the functional output of NAc
      neurons, contributing to the addictive emotional and motivational state.

TI  - 'Roid rage in rats? Testosterone effects on aggressive motivation, impulsivity
      and tyrosine hydroxylase.
PG  - 6-12
LID - 10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.12.005 [doi]
LID - S0031-9384(12)00411-8 [pii]
AB  - In humans and animals, anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) increase aggression,
      but the underlying behavioral mechanisms are unclear. AAS may increase the
      motivation to fight. Alternatively, AAS may increase impulsive behavior,
      consistent with the popular image of 'roid rage. To test this, adolescent male
      rats were treated chronically with testosterone (7.5mg/kg) or vehicle and tested 
      for aggressive motivation and impulsivity. Rats were trained to respond on a
      nose-poke on a 10 min fixed-interval schedule for the opportunity to fight in
      their home cage with an unfamiliar rat. Although testosterone increased
      aggression (6.3+/-1.3 fights/5 min vs 2.4+/-0.8 for controls, p<0.05), there was 
      no difference in operant responding (28.4+/-1.6 nose-pokes/10 min for
      testosterone, 32.4+/-7.0 for vehicle). This suggests that testosterone does not
      enhance motivation for aggression. To test for impulsivity, rats were trained to 
      respond for food in a delay-discounting procedure. In an operant chamber, one
      lever delivered one food pellet immediately, the other lever gave 4 pellets after
      a delay (0, 15, 30 or 45 s). In testosterone- and vehicle-treated rats, body
      weights and food intake did not differ. However, testosterone-treated rats chose 
      the larger, delayed reward more often (4.5+/-0.7 times in 10 trials with 45 s
      delay) than vehicle controls (2.5+/-0.5 times, p<0.05), consistent with a
      reduction in impulsive choice. Thus, although chronic high-dose testosterone
      enhances aggression, this does not include an increase in impulsive behavior or
      motivation to fight. This is further supported by measurement of tyrosine
      hydroxylase (TH) by Western immunoblot analysis in brain regions important for
      motivation (nucleus accumbens, Acb) and executive function (medial prefrontal
      cortex, PFC). There were no differences in TH between testosterone- and
      vehicle-treated rats in Acb or PFC. However, testosterone significantly reduced
      TH (to 76.9+/-3.1% of controls, p<0.05) in the caudate-putamen, a brain area
      important for behavioral inhibition, motor control and habit learning.

AB  - The pFC has a crucial role in cognitive control, executive function, and sensory 
      processing. Functional imaging, neurophysiological, and animal studies provide
      evidence for a functional connectivity between the dorsolateral pFC (DLPFC) and
      the primary motor cortex (M1) during free choice but not instructed choice
      selection tasks. In this study, twin coil, neuronavigated TMS was used to examine
      the precise timing of the functional interaction between human left DLPFC and
      ipsilateral M1 during the execution of a free/specified choice selection task
      involving the digits of the right hand. In a thumb muscle that was not involved
      in the task, a conditioning pulse to the left DLPFC enhanced the excitability of 
      the ipsilateral M1 during free selection more than specified selection 100 msec
      after presentation of the cue; the opposite effect was seen at 75 msec. However, 
      the difference between free and externally specified conditions disappeared when 
      a task-specific muscle was investigated. In this case, the influence from DLPFC
      was dominated by task involvement rather than mode of selection, suggesting that 
      other processes related to movement execution were also operating. Finally, we
      show that the effects were spatially specific because they were absent when an
      adjacent area of DLPFC was stimulated. These results reveal temporally and
      spatially selective interactions between BA 46 and M1 that are both task and
      muscle specific.

TI  - Inhibition of dopamine transporter activity impairs synaptic depression in rat
      prefrontal cortex through over-stimulation of D1 receptors.
PG  - 945-55
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhs376 [doi]
AB  - In rat prefrontal cortex (PFC), long-term depression induced by low-frequency
      single stimuli has never been studied. Combined with the well-documented
      involvement of dopamine transporters (DATs) in the regulation of PFC-dependent
      cognitive processes, it is important to test whether this form of plasticity can 
      be modulated by DAT activity in the PFC. Here, we show first that prolonged 3-Hz 
      stimuli successfully induced synaptic depression in rat PFC slices whose
      induction depended on endogenous stimulation of D1-like and D2-like receptors and
      the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). This
      depression was found to be significantly impaired by selective inhibition of the 
      DAT by GBR12909 (1-200 nM) or GBR12935 (100 nM). The excess amount of
      extracellular dopamine caused by DAT inhibition acted critically on D1-like
      receptors to impair depression. Furthermore, this impairment by GBR12 909 was
      cancelled by the allosteric-positive mGluR5 modulator CDPPB, the drug known to
      reverse hyperdopaminergia-induced abnormal PFC activity, and the associated
      cognitive disturbances. Finally, these induction, impairment, and restoration of 
      synaptic depression were correlated by an inverted-U shape manner with the
      phosphorylation level of ERK1/2. We suggest that abnormal increases of the
      extracellular dopamine level by DAT inhibition impair synaptic depression in the 
      PFC through over-stimulation of D1-like receptors.

AB  - Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) modulates dopamine in the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) and influences PFC dopamine-dependent cognitive task performance. A human
      COMT polymorphism (Val(158)Met) alters enzyme activity and is associated with
      both the activation and functional connectivity of the PFC during task
      performance, particularly working memory. Here, we used functional magnetic
      resonance imaging and a data-driven, independent components analysis (ICA)
      approach to compare resting state functional connectivity within the executive
      control network (ECN) between young, male COMT Val(158) (n=27) and Met(158)
      (n=28) homozygotes. COMT genotype effects on grey matter were assessed using
      voxel-based morphometry. COMT genotype significantly modulated functional
      connectivity within the ECN, which included the head of the caudate, and anterior
      cingulate and frontal cortical regions. Val(158) homozygotes showed greater
      functional connectivity between a cluster within the left ventrolateral PFC and
      the rest of the ECN (using a threshold of Z>2.3 and a family-wise error cluster
      significance level of p<0.05). This difference occurred in the absence of any
      alterations in grey matter. Our data show that COMT Val(158)Met affects the
      functional connectivity of the PFC at rest, complementing its prominent role in
      the activation and functional connectivity of this region during cognitive task
      performance. The results suggest that genotype-related differences in prefrontal 
      dopaminergic tone result in neuroadaptive changes in basal functional
      connectivity, potentially including subtle COMT genotype-dependent differences in
      the relative coupling of task-positive and task-negative regions, which could in 
      turn contribute to its effects on brain activation, connectivity, and behaviour.

AB  - Frontal subcortical cognitive defects are predominant in Parkinson's disease
      (PD). Temporal lobe dysfunction seems more relevant for progression to dementia. 
      We aimed to study the relative importance of temporal lobe defects versus
      executive impairment in the progression to dementia in PD by using proton
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). The (1)H-MRS features of PD patients 
      with intact cognition (PD-CgInt; n = 16), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 15)
      and dementia (PDD; n = 15) were compared, to delineate the metabolic alterations 
      correlating with cognitive status. Metabolite concentrations were acquired from
      voxels localized to the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC). 
      Cognitive status was established following the Movement Disorder Society PDD
      criteria, administering the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale and Mattis Dementia
      Rating Scale. The Parkinson's Disease Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS) was used to
      correlate (1)H-MRS with neuropsychology. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentrations
      in the right DL-PFC were decreased in PD-MCI compared with PD-CgInt patients (p =
      0.002), and correlated with frontal subcortical tasks. Decreased NAA
      concentrations in the left hippocampus in PDD compared to PD-MCI (p = 0.03)
      correlated with confrontation naming. The present findings support that executive
      impairment is related to dorsolateral prefrontal dysfunction from the early
      stages, while progression to dementia is linked to the additional impairment of
      temporal lobe structures. The PD-CRS was able to capture the differential
      impairment of prefrontal versus temporal cortical areas.

AB  - Executive function encompasses a range of control processes supporting flexible, 
      goal-directed behaviour. Attentional set-shifting, updating of information in
      working memory, and inhibitory control have been proposed as key components of
      executive function, but debate continues as to the validity of this conceptual
      framework, and the neural substrates of these putative components. Here we
      examined prefrontal structure-function relationships for each of these component 
      processes in a large cohort of patients with focal prefrontal damage. Forty-five 
      patients with focal damage to various sectors of prefrontal cortex (PFC), and 50 
      demographically matched healthy control subjects performed an attention shifting 
      task, the Stroop colour naming task, and a spatial search task. Voxel-based
      lesion-symptom mapping revealed that damage to left ventrolateral PFC led to
      impaired performance on both the Stroop and attention shifting tasks. In
      contrast, performance of the spatial search task depended on several regions
      within PFC, but notably not left ventrolateral PFC. These observations were
      confirmed with direct comparison of performance between patients grouped
      according to lesion location. This dissociation partly supports the component
      process view of executive function, distinguishing the goal-directed regulation
      of attention (perhaps specifically in the verbal domain) from the requirements of
      the spatial search task, including the updating of information in spatial working
      memory. These findings are easier to reconcile with modular, material-specific
      accounts than with more unitary models of executive function.

PG  - 88
LID - 10.3389/fncir.2012.00088 [doi]
AB  - Prefrontal cortical (PFC) activity in the primate brain emerging from
      minicolumnar microcircuits plays a critical role in cognitive processes dealing
      with executive control of behavior. However, the specific operations of columnar 
      laminar processing in prefrontal cortex (PFC) are not completely understood. Here
      we show via implementation of unique microanatomical recording and stimulating
      arrays, that minicolumns in PFC are involved in the executive control of behavior
      in rhesus macaque nonhuman primates (NHPs) performing a delayed-match-to-sample
      (DMS) task. PFC neurons demonstrate functional interactions between pairs of
      putative pyramidal cells within specified cortical layers via anatomically
      oriented minicolumns. Results reveal target-specific, spatially tuned firing
      between inter-laminar (layer 2/3 and layer 5) pairs of neurons participating in
      the gating of information during the decision making phase of the task with
      differential correlations between activity in layer 2/3 and layer 5 in the
      integration of spatial vs. object-specific information for correct task
      performance. Such inter-laminar processing was exploited by the interfacing of an
      online model which delivered stimulation to layer 5 locations in a pattern
      associated with successful performance thereby closing the columnar loop
      externally in a manner that mimicked normal processing in the same task. These
      unique technologies demonstrate that PFC neurons encode and process information
      via minicolumns which provides a closed loop form of "executive function," hence 
      disruption of such inter-laminar processing could form the bases for cognitive
      dysfunction in primate brain.

PG  - 668-78
LID - 10.1111/ejn.12062 [doi]
AB  - It has been suggested that working memory (WM) for novel information requires the
      medial temporal lobes (MTL), but is not necessary for WM for familiar stimuli. In
      previous studies that directly compared WM for novel and familiar stimuli, only
      the novel stimuli were trial-unique. Here, 16 young human subjects performed a
      Sternberg WM task with visual scenes while in a functional magnetic resonance
      imaging scanner. All task stimuli were trial-unique, but were either new (Novel
      condition) or previously learned (Familiar condition). This design allowed
      investigation of whether MTL and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity is related
      specifically to the novelty/familiarity of the stimuli or to their trial-unique
      status during WM. We observed greater hippocampal and parahippocampal activity
      during encoding and maintenance for novel than for familiar stimuli. In contrast,
      right mid-dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) activity was greater during encoding of
      familiar than novel stimuli. The mid-dlPFC was not recruited during maintenance
      or for retrieval when the Familiar condition was contrasted with the Novel
      condition. However, left mid-dlPFC activity was present at retrieval when correct
      Match trials (i.e. hits) were contrasted with correct Non-match trials (i.e.
      correct rejections) for the Novel condition. The results support the hypothesis
      that MTL regions are required for the encoding and maintenance of novel stimuli
      during WM, demonstrating that the observed MTL activity is not related to the
      trial-uniqueness of the stimuli per se. Furthermore, the observed activation
      pattern in mid-dlPFC suggests a role for the mid-dlPFC in executive
      control-associated processes related to monitoring of scene familiarity at
      encoding and retrieval during WM.

PG  - 374-87
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00331 [doi]
AB  - Discordant development of brain regions responsible for cognitive control and
      reward processing may render adolescents susceptible to risk taking. Identifying 
      ways to reduce this neural imbalance during adolescence can have important
      implications for risk taking and associated health outcomes. Accordingly, we
      sought to examine how a key family relationship-family obligation-can reduce this
      vulnerability. Forty-eight adolescents underwent an fMRI scan during which they
      completed a risk-taking and cognitive control task. Results suggest that
      adolescents with greater family obligation values show decreased activation in
      the ventral striatum when receiving monetary rewards and increased dorsolateral
      PFC activation during behavioral inhibition. Reduced ventral striatum activation 
      correlated with less real-life risk-taking behavior and enhanced dorsolateral PFC
      activation correlated with better decision-making skills. Thus, family obligation
      may decrease reward sensitivity and enhance cognitive control, thereby reducing
      risk-taking behaviors.

AB  - Despite considerable recent interest, the biological basis and clinical diagnosis
      of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) pose unresolved problems. 
      Mentalising (the cognitive capacity to interpret the behaviour of oneself and
      others in terms of mental states) is impaired as a prominent feature of bvFTD,
      consistent with involvement of brain regions including ventro-medial prefrontal
      cortex (PFC), orbitofrontal cortex and anterior temporal lobes. Here, we
      investigated mentalising ability in a cohort of patients with bvFTD using a novel
      modality: music. We constructed a novel neuropsychological battery requiring
      attribution of affective mental or non-mental associations to musical stimuli.
      Mentalising performance of patients with bvFTD (n = 20) was assessed in relation 
      to matched healthy control subjects (n = 20); patients also had a comprehensive
      assessment of behaviour and general neuropsychological functions. Neuroanatomical
      correlates of performance on the experimental tasks were investigated using
      voxel-based morphometry of patients' brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      scans. Compared to healthy control subjects, patients showed impaired ability to 
      attribute mental states but not non-mental characteristics to music, and this
      deficit correlated with performance on a standard test of social inference and
      with carer ratings of patients' empathic capacity, but not with other potentially
      relevant measures of general neuropsychological function. Mentalising performance
      in the bvFTD group was associated with grey matter changes in anterior temporal
      lobe and ventro-medial PFC. These findings suggest that music can represent
      surrogate mental states and the ability to construct such mental representations 
      is impaired in bvFTD, with potential implications for our understanding of the
      biology of bvFTD and human social cognition more broadly.

      prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 772-80
LID - 10.1037/a0030493 [doi]
AB  - The prefrontal cortex has been identified as essential for executive function, as
      well as for aspects of rule learning and recognition memory. As part of our
      studies to assess prefrontal cortical function in the monkey, we evaluated the
      effects of damage to the dorsal prefrontal cortex (DPFC) on the Category Set
      Shifting Task (CSST), a test of abstraction and set-shifting, and on the Delayed 
      Nonmatching to Sample (DNMS) task, a benchmark test of rule learning and
      recognition memory. The DPFC lesions in this study included dorsolateral and
      dorsomedial aspects of the PFC. In a previous report, we published evidence of an
      impairment on the CSST as a consequence of DPFC lesions (Moore, Schettler,
      Killiany, Rosene, & Moss, 2009). Here we report that monkeys with lesions of the 
      DPFC were also markedly impaired relative to controls on both the acquisition
      (rule learning) and performance (recognition memory) conditions of trial-unique
      DNMS. The presence and extent of the deficits that we observed were of some
      surprise and support the possibility that the dorsal prefrontal cortex plays a
      more direct role in learning and recognition memory than had been previously
      thought.

      predicts cognitive impairment and excessive alcohol drinking.
PG  - 18156-61
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1116523109 [doi]
AB  - Chronic intermittent access to alcohol leads to the escalation of alcohol intake,
      similar to binge drinking in humans. Converging lines of evidence suggest that
      impairment of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) cognitive function and
      overactivation of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) are key factors that 
      lead to excessive drinking in dependence. However, the role of the mPFC and CeA
      in the escalation of alcohol intake in rats with a history of binge drinking
      without dependence is currently unknown. To address this issue, we examined FBJ
      murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Fos) expression in the mPFC, CeA,
      hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens and evaluated working memory and anxiety-like 
      behavior in rats given continuous (24 h/d for 7 d/wk) or intermittent (3 d/wk)
      access to alcohol (20% vol/vol) using a two-bottle choice paradigm. The results
      showed that abstinence from alcohol in rats with a history of escalation of
      alcohol intake specifically recruited GABA and corticotropin-releasing factor
      (CRF) neurons in the mPFC and produced working memory impairments associated with
      excessive alcohol drinking during acute (24-72 h) but not protracted (16 -68 d)
      abstinence. Moreover, abstinence from alcohol was associated with a functional
      disconnection of the mPFC and CeA but not mPFC and nucleus accumbens. These
      results show that recruitment of a subset of GABA and CRF neurons in the mPFC
      during withdrawal and disconnection of the PFC-CeA pathway may be critical for
      impaired executive control over motivated behavior, suggesting that dysregulation
      of mPFC interneurons may be an early index of neuroadaptation in alcohol
      dependence.

AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) is reduced in patients who suffer from panic
      disorder (PD). Reduced HRV is related to hypoactivity in the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC), which negatively affects executive functioning. The present study assessed
      the relationships between vagally mediated HRV at baseline and measures of
      executive functioning in 36 patients with PD. Associations between these
      physiological and cognitive measures and panic-related variables were also
      investigated. HRV was measured using HF-power (ms(2)), and executive functions
      were assessed with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the Color-Word
      Interference Test (CWIT) from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System
      (D-KEFS). Panic-related variables comprised panic frequency, panic-related
      distress, and duration of PD. Performance on the neuropsychological measures
      correlated significantly with HRV. Both panic-related distress and duration of PD
      were inversely related with measures of HRV and cognitive inhibition. The current
      findings support the purported relationship between HRV and executive functions
      involving the PFC.

TI  - Response inhibition impairment in high functioning autism and attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder: evidence from near-infrared spectroscopy data.
PG  - e46569
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0046569 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Response inhibition, an important domain of executive function (EF), 
      involves the ability to suppress irrelevant or interfering information and
      impulses. Previous studies have shown impairment of response inhibition in high
      functioning autism (HFA) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but
      more recent findings have been inconsistent. To date, almost no studies have been
      conducted using functional imaging techniques to directly compare inhibitory
      control between children with HFA and those with ADHD. METHOD: Nineteen children 
      with HFA, 16 age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched children with ADHD, and 
      16 typically developing (TD) children were imaged using functional near-infrared 
      spectroscopy (NIRS) while performing Go/No-go and Stroop tasks. RESULTS: Compared
      with the TD group, children in both the HFA and ADHD groups took more time to
      respond during the No-go blocks, with reaction time longest for HFA and shortest 
      for TD. Children in the HFA and ADHD groups also made a greater number of
      reaction errors in the No-go blocks than those in the TD group. During the Stroop
      task, there were no significant differences between these three groups in
      reaction time and omission errors. Both the HFA and ADHD groups showed a higher
      level of inactivation in the right prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the No-go
      blocks, relative to the TD group. However, no significant differences were found 
      between groups in the levels of oxyhemoglobin concentration in the PFC during the
      Stroop task. CONCLUSION: Functional brain imaging using NIRS showed reduced
      activation in the right PFC in children with HFA or ADHD during an inhibition
      task, indicating that inhibitory dysfunction is a shared feature of both HFA and 
      ADHD.

TI  - Lateralization in intrinsic functional connectivity of the temporoparietal
      junction with salience- and attention-related brain networks.
PG  - 3382-92
LID - 10.1152/jn.00674.2012 [doi]
AB  - Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the right temporoparietal junction
      (TPJ) is activated during detection of salient stimuli, including pain, in the
      sensory environment. Right TPJ damage more often produces spatial neglect than
      left TPJ damage. We recently reported a right lateralized system of white matter 
      connectivity of the TPJ. However, lateralization in intrinsic TPJ functional
      connectivity during a task/stimuli-independent state has not been fully
      characterized. Here we used resting-state functional MRI in healthy humans to
      compare the functional connectivity of right and left TPJ with salience- and
      attention-related brain networks. Independent components analysis revealed that
      both right and left TPJ were functionally connected with a network that included 
      the anterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and mid-cingulate
      cortex, considered to be the salience/ventral attention network. Dual regression 
      revealed this network was more strongly connected with right TPJ than left TPJ.
      Seed-based functional connectivity analysis showed 1) negative connectivity the
      TPJ bilaterally with the "default mode network"; 2) positive connectivity of TPJ 
      bilaterally with the salience/ventral attention network; 3) stronger connectivity
      between right TPJ compared with left TPJ with regions within the salience/ventral
      attention network and mid-insula, S2, and temporal/parietal opercula (implicated 
      in pain); and 4) stronger connectivity of left TPJ compared with right TPJ with
      the "executive control network," including the dorsomedial/medial PFC, inferior
      frontal gyrus, and cerebellum (crus I/II). Our findings build on classic lesion
      and neuroimaging studies, demonstrating a complex spatial network organization of
      lateralization in TPJ functional connectivity in the absence of an overt
      stimulus.

TI  - Columnar processing in primate pFC: evidence for executive control microcircuits.
PG  - 2334-47
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00307 [doi]
AB  - A common denominator for many cognitive disorders of human brain is the
      disruption of neural activity within pFC, whose structural basis is primarily
      interlaminar (columnar) microcircuits or "minicolumns." The importance of this
      brain region for executive decision-making has been well documented; however,
      because of technological constraints, the minicolumnar basis is not well
      understood. Here, via implementation of a unique conformal multielectrode
      recording array, the role of interlaminar pFC minicolumns in the executive
      control of task-related target selection is demonstrated in nonhuman primates
      performing a visuomotor DMS task. The results reveal target-specific,
      interlaminar correlated firing during the decision phase of the trial between
      multielectrode recording array-isolated minicolumnar pairs of neurons located in 
      parallel in layers 2/3 and layer 5 of pFC. The functional significance of
      individual pFC minicolumns (separated by 40 mum) was shown by reduced correlated 
      firing between cell pairs within single minicolumns on error trials with
      inappropriate target selection. To further demonstrate dependence on performance,
      a task-disrupting drug (cocaine) was administered in the middle of the session,
      which also reduced interlaminar firing in minicolumns that fired appropriately in
      the early (nondrug) portion of the session. The results provide a direct
      demonstration of task-specific, real-time columnar processing in pFC indicating
      the role of this type of microcircuit in executive control of decision-making in 
      primate brain.

AB  - Executive functions supported by prefrontal cortical (PFC) systems provide
      essential control and planning mechanisms to guide goal-directed behavior. As
      such, age-related alterations in executive functions can mediate profound and
      widespread deficits on a diverse array of neurocognitive processes. Many of the
      critical neuroanatomical and functional characteristics of prefrontal cortex are 
      preserved in rodents, allowing for meaningful cross species comparisons relevant 
      to the study of cognitive aging. In particular, as rodents lend themselves to
      genetic, cellular and biochemical approaches, rodent models of executive function
      stand to significantly contribute to our understanding of the critical
      neurobiological mechanisms that mediate decline of executive processes across the
      lifespan. Moreover, rodent analogs of executive functions that decline in human
      aging represent an essential component of a targeted, rational approach for
      developing and testing effective treatment and prevention therapies for
      age-related cognitive decline. This paper reviews behavioral approaches used to
      study executive function in rodents, with a focus on those assays that share a
      foundation in the psychological and neuroanatomical constructs important for
      human aging. A particular emphasis is placed on behavioral approaches used to
      assess working memory and cognitive flexibility, which are sensitive to decline
      with age across species and for which strong rodent models currently exist. In
      addition, other approaches in rodent behavior that have potential for providing
      analogs to functions that reliably decline to human aging (e.g., information
      processing speed) are discussed.

AB  - More than 70% of adolescents report to have smoked a cigarette at least once. At 
      the adolescent stage the brain has not completed its maturation. The prefrontal
      cortex (PFC), the brain area responsible for executive functions and attention
      performance, is one of the last brain areas to mature and is still developing
      during adolescence. Smoking during adolescence increases the risk of developing
      psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment in later life. In addition,
      adolescent smokers suffer from attention deficits, which aggravate with the years
      of smoking. Recent studies in rodents reveal the molecular changes induced by
      adolescent nicotine exposure that alter the functioning of synapses in the PFC
      and that underlie the lasting effects on cognitive function. Here we provide an
      overview of these recent findings.

PG  - 624795
LID - 10.1155/2012/624795 [doi]
AB  - Age-related cognitive impairments often include difficulty retrieving memories,
      particularly those that rely on executive control. In this paper we discuss the
      influence of the prefrontal cortex on memory retrieval, and the specific memory
      processes associated with the prefrontal cortex that decline in late adulthood.
      We conclude that preretrieval processes associated with preparation to make a
      memory judgment are impaired, leading to greater reliance on postretrieval
      processes. This is consistent with the view that impairments in executive control
      significantly contribute to deficits in controlled retrieval. Finally, we discuss
      age-related changes in sleep as a potential mechanism that contributes to
      deficiencies in executive control that are important for efficient retrieval. The
      sleep literature points to the importance of slow-wave sleep in restoration of
      prefrontal cortex function. Given that slow-wave sleep significantly declines
      with age, we hypothesize that age-related changes in slow-wave sleep could
      mediate age-related decline in executive control, manifesting a robust deficit in
      controlled memory retrieval processes. Interventions, like physical activity,
      that improve sleep could be effective methods to enhance controlled memory
      processes in late life.

AB  - Stimulant dependence is associated with neuropsychological impairments. Here, we

      substrates of neuropsychological (dys)function in stimulant dependence, including
      cocaine, (meth-)amphetamine, ecstasy and nicotine dependence, and excessive
      caffeine use, comparing stimulant abusers (SAs) to nondrug using healthy controls
      (HCs). Despite some inconsistencies, most studies indicated altered brain
      activation in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and insula in response to reward and
      punishment, and higher limbic and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)/PFC activation 
      during craving and attentional bias paradigms in SAs compared with HCs.
      Impulsivity in SAs was associated with lower ACC and presupplementary motor area 
      activity compared with HCs, and related to both ventral (amygdala, ventrolateral 
      PFC, insula) and dorsal (dorsolateral PFC, dorsal ACC, posterior parietal cortex)
      systems. Decision making in SAs was associated with low dorsolateral PFC activity
      and high orbitofrontal activity. Finally, executive function in SAs was
      associated with lower activation in frontotemporal regions and higher activation 
      in premotor cortex compared with HCs. It is concluded that the lower activations 
      compared with HCs are likely to reflect the neural substrate of impaired
      neurocognitive functions, whereas higher activations in SAs compared with HCs are
      likely to reflect compensatory cognitive control mechanisms to keep behavioral
      task performance to a similar level as in HCs. However, before final conclusions 
      can be drawn, additional research is needed using neuroimaging in SAs and HCs
      using larger and more homogeneous samples as well as more comparable task
      paradigms, study designs, and statistical analyses.

AB  - Whereas neuroimaging studies of healthy subjects have demonstrated an association
      between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and cognitive control functions,
      including response monitoring and error detection, lesion studies are sparse and 
      have produced mixed results. Due to largely normal behavioral test results in two
      patients with medial prefrontal lesions, a hypothesis has been advanced claiming 
      that the ACC is not involved in cognitive operations. In the current study, two
      comparably rare patients with unilateral lesions to dorsal medial prefrontal
      cortex (MPFC) encompassing the ACC were assessed with neuropsychological tests as
      well as Event-Related Potentials in two experimental paradigms known to engage
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). These included an auditory Novelty Oddball task and a
      visual Stop-signal task. Both patients performed normally on the Stroop test but 
      showed reduced performance on tests of learning and memory. Moreover, altered
      attentional control was reflected in a diminished Novelty P3, whereas the
      posterior P3b to target stimuli was present in both patients. The error-related
      negativity, which has been hypothesized to be generated in the ACC, was present
      in both patients, but alterations of inhibitory behavior were observed. Although 
      interpretative caution is generally called for in single case studies, and the
      fact that the lesions extended outside the ACC, the findings nevertheless suggest
      a role for MPFC in cognitive control that is not restricted to error monitoring.

AB  - Early life adverse events can lead to structural and functional impairments in
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we investigated whether maternal deprivation
      (MD) alters PFC-dependent executive functions, neurons and astrocytes number and 
      synaptic plasticity in adult male Long-Evans rats. The deprivation protocol
      consisted of a daily separation of newborn Long-Evans pups from their mothers and
      littermates 3h/day postnatal day 1-14. Cognitive performances were assessed in
      adulthood using the temporal order memory task (TMT) and the attentional
      set-shifting task (ASST) that principally implicates the PFC and the Morris water
      maze task (WMT) that does not essentially rely on the PFC. The neurons and
      astrocytes of the prelimbic (PrL) area of the medial PFC (mPFC) were
      immunolabelled respectively with anti-NeuN and anti-GFAP antibodies and
      quantified by stereology. The field potentials evoked by electrical stimulation
      of ventral hippocampus (ventral HPC) were recorded in vivo in the PrL area. In
      adulthood, MD produced cognitive deficits in two PFC-dependent tasks, the TMT and
      ASST, but not in the WMT. In parallel, MD induced in the prelimbic area of the
      medial PFC an upregulation of long-term potentiation (LTP), without any change in
      the number of neurons and astrocytes. We provide evidence that MD leads in adults
      to an alteration of the cognitive abilities dependent on the PFC, and to an
      exaggerated synaptic plasticity in this region. We suggest that this latter
      phenomenon may contribute to the impairments in the cognitive tasks.

AB  - A considerable body of previous research on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has
      helped characterize the regional specificity of various cognitive functions, such
      as cognitive control and decision making. Here we provide definitive findings on 
      this topic, using a neuropsychological approach that takes advantage of a unique 
      dataset accrued over several decades. We applied voxel-based lesion-symptom
      mapping in 344 individuals with focal lesions (165 involving the PFC) who had
      been tested on a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tasks. Two distinct 
      functional-anatomical networks were revealed within the PFC: one associated with 
      cognitive control (response inhibition, conflict monitoring, and switching),
      which included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex
      and a second associated with value-based decision-making, which included the
      orbitofrontal, ventromedial, and frontopolar cortex. Furthermore, cognitive
      control tasks shared a common performance factor related to set shifting that was
      linked to the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. By contrast, regions in the
      ventral PFC were required for decision-making. These findings provide detailed
      causal evidence for a remarkable functional-anatomical specificity in the human
      PFC.

      trauma on brain development and learning.
PG  - S23-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2012.04.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Youth who experience traumatic stress and develop post-traumatic
      symptoms secrete higher levels of the glucocorticoid cortisol than youth with no 
      trauma history. Animal research suggests that excess corticosterone secretion can
      lead to neurotoxicity in areas of the brain rich in glucocorticoid receptors such
      as the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These two areas of the brain 
      are involved in memory processing and executive function, both critical functions
      of learning. METHODS: In this article, we summarize findings presented at the
      National Summit for Stress and the Brain conducted at Johns Hopkins University's 
      Department of Public Health in April 2011. The presentation highlighted
      structural and functional imaging findings in the hippocampus and PFC of youth
      with post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). RESULTS: Youth with PTSS have higher 
      levels of cortisol. Prebedtime cortisol levels predict decreases in hippocampal
      volume longitudinally. Cortisol levels are negatively correlated with volume in
      the PFC. Functional imaging studies demonstrate reduced hippocampal and PFC
      activities on tasks of memory and executive function in youth with PTSS when
      compared with control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Effective interventions for youth
      with PTSS should target improved function of frontolimbic networks. Treatment
      outcome research using these potential markers can help develop more focused
      interventions that target the impaired learning of vulnerable youth experiencing 
      traumatic stress.

PG  - 2146-58
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhs194 [doi]
AB  - Recent theories propose that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is organized in a
      hierarchical fashion with more abstract, higher level information represented in 
      anterior regions and more concrete, lower level information represented in
      posterior regions. This hierarchical organization affords flexible adjustments of
      action plans based on the context. Computational models suggest that such
      hierarchical organization in the PFC is achieved through interactions with the
      basal ganglia (BG) wherein the BG gate relevant contexts into the PFC. Here, we
      tested this proposal using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
      Participants were scanned while updating working memory (WM) with 2 levels of
      hierarchical contexts. Consistent with PFC abstraction proposals, higher level
      context updates involved anterior portions of the PFC (BA 46), whereas lower
      level context updates involved posterior portions of the PFC (BA 6).
      Computational models were only partially supported as the BG were sensitive to
      higher, but not lower level context updates. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) 
      showed the opposite pattern. Analyses examining changes in functional
      connectivity confirmed dissociable roles of the anterior PFC-BG during higher
      level context updates and posterior PFC-PPC during lower level context updates.
      These results suggest that hierarchical contexts are organized by distinct
      frontal-striatal and frontal-parietal networks.

AB  - A large number of studies in both humans and experimental animals have
      demonstrated nicotine-induced improvements in various aspects of cognitive
      function, including attention and memory. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought 
      to be critically involved in the modulation of executive function and these
      attentional processes are enhanced by nicotine acting at nicotinic acetylcholine 
      receptors. The involvement of nicotinic processes on cognitive flexibility in
      particular has not been specifically investigated. The effects of nicotine on
      attentional flexibility were therefore evaluated using the rodent attentional set
      shifting task in rats. Nicotine injected both acutely and following repeated
      pre-exposure significantly improved both intradimensional and extradimensional
      set shifting performance in the task. Further investigation of the acute effects 
      of nicotine demonstrated this improvement in attentional flexibility to be
      dose-dependent. These results implicate the nicotinic receptor system in the
      mediation of processes underlying cognitive flexibility and suggest that nicotine
      improves attentional flexibility in rats, both within and between perceptual
      dimensions of a compound stimulus. Nicotine-induced alterations in prefrontal

TI  - Recall deficits in stroke patients with thalamic lesions covary with damage to
      the parvocellular mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus.

AB  - The functional role of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) and its cortical
      network in memory processes is discussed controversially. While Aggleton and
      Brown (1999) suggested a role for recognition and not recall, Van der Werf et al.
      (2003) suggested that this nucleus is functionally related to executive function 
      and strategic retrieval, based on its connections to the prefrontal cortices
      (PFC). The present study used a lesion approach including patients with focal
      thalamic lesions to examine the functions of the MD, the intralaminar nuclei and 
      the midline nuclei in memory processing. A newly designed pair association task
      was used, which allowed the assessment of recognition and cued recall
      performance. Volume loss in thalamic nuclei was estimated as a predictor for
      alterations in memory performance. Patients performed poorer than healthy
      controls on recognition accuracy and cued recall. Furthermore, patients responded
      slower than controls specifically on recognition trials followed by successful
      cued recall of the paired associate. Reduced recall of picture pairs and
      increased response times during recognition followed by cued recall covaried with
      the volume loss in the parvocellular MD. This pattern suggests a role of this
      thalamic region in recall and thus recollection, which does not fit the framework
      proposed by Aggleton and Brown (1999). The functional specialization of the
      parvocellular MD accords with its connectivity to the dorsolateral PFC,
      highlighting the role of this thalamocortical network in explicit memory (Van der
      Werf et al., 2003).

TI  - Dynamic goal states: adjusting cognitive control without conflict monitoring.
PG  - 126-36
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.06.021 [doi]
AB  - A central topic in the cognitive sciences is how cognitive control is adjusted
      flexibly to changing environmental demands at different time scales to produce
      goal-oriented behavior. According to an influential account, the
      context-sensitive recruitment of cognitive control is mediated by a specialized
      conflict monitoring process that registers current conflict and signals the
      demand for enhanced control in subsequent trials. This view has been immensely
      successful not least due to supporting evidence from neuroimaging studies
      suggesting that the conflict monitoring function is localized within the anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC) which, in turn, signals the demand for enhanced control to
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this article, we propose an alternative model of 
      the adaptive regulation of cognitive control based on multistable goal attractor 
      network dynamics and adjustments of cognitive control within a conflict trial.
      Without incorporation of an explicit conflict monitoring module, the model
      mirrors behavior in conflict tasks accounting for effects of response congruency,
      sequential conflict adaptation, and proportion of incongruent trials.
      Importantly, the model also mirrors frequency tagged EEG data indicating
      continuous conflict adaptation and suggests a reinterpretation of the correlation
      between ACC and the PFC BOLD data reported in previous imaging studies. Together,
      our simulation data propose an alternative interpretation of both behavioral data
      as well as imaging data that have previously been interpreted in favor of a
      specialized conflict monitoring process in the ACC.

TI  - COMT polymorphisms as predictors of cognitive dysfunction during manic and mixed 
      episodes in bipolar I disorder.
PG  - 554-64
LID - 10.1111/j.1399-5618.2012.01030.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The dopaminergic system plays an important role in the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) and is believed to mediate cognitive dysfunction (CD) in bipolar
      disorder (BD). The enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is involved in the 
      catabolism of dopamine in the PFC, and an association between COMT single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and BD has been reported. COMT SNPs have also
      been associated with executive and working memory performance in healthy
      subjects, patients with schizophrenia, and euthymic BD patients. The objective of
      this study was to investigate the association between COMT SNPs and acute CD
      during BD mood episodes. METHODS: Seventy-two symptomatic, medication-free
      subjects with bipolar I disorder (BD-I) and 76 healthy controls were evaluated
      using neuropsychological tests, and genotyped for COMT SNPs rs4680 and rs165599. 
      RESULTS: Patients undergoing mania and mixed episodes carrying the COMT allele G 
      had better performance on executive function, memory, verbal fluency, and
      intelligence tests. Moreover, an interaction was detected between the COMT allele
      G and the Young Mania Rating Scale in BD CD. CONCLUSIONS: Allele G from COMT SNPs
      rs4680 and rs165599 may represent reliable state-dependent predictors of global
      CD during manic and mixed episodes in BD. Further studies in larger samples are
      necessary to confirm these findings.

PG  - 7917-25
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0307-12.2012 [doi]
AB  - A large corpus of research indicates that exposure to stress impairs cognitive
      abilities, specifically executive functioning dependent on the prefrontal cortex 
      (PFC). We collected structural MRI scans (n = 61), well-validated assessments of 
      executive functioning, and detailed interviews assessing stress exposure in
      humans to examine whether cumulative life stress affected brain morphometry and
      one type of executive functioning, spatial working memory, during adolescence-a
      critical time of brain development and reorganization. Analysis of variations in 
      brain structure revealed that cumulative life stress and spatial working memory
      were related to smaller volumes in the PFC, specifically prefrontal gray and
      white matter between the anterior cingulate and the frontal poles. Mediation
      analyses revealed that individual differences in prefrontal volumes accounted for
      the association between cumulative life stress and spatial working memory. These 
      results suggest that structural changes in the PFC may serve as a mediating
      mechanism through which greater cumulative life stress engenders decrements in
      cognitive functioning.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in a variety of cognitive and executive
      operations. However, this region is not a single functional unit; rather, it is
      composed of several functionally and anatomically distinct networks, including
      anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and
      orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). These prefrontal subregions serve dissociable
      behavioral functions, and are unique in their afferent and efferent connections. 
      Each of these subregions is innervated by ascending cholinergic and noradrenergic
      systems, each of which likewise has a distinct role in cognitive function; yet
      the distribution and projection patterns of cells in the source nuclei for these 
      pathways have not been examined in great detail. In this study, fluorescent
      retrograde tracers were injected into ACC, mPFC, and OFC, and labeled cells were 
      identified in the cholinergic nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) and noradrenergic 
      nucleus locus coeruleus (LC). Injections into all three cortical regions
      consistently labeled cells primarily ipsilateral to the injection site with a
      minimal contralateral component. In NBM, retrogradely labeled neurons were
      scattered throughout the rostral half of the nucleus, whereas those in LC tended 
      to cluster in the core of the nucleus, and were rarely localized within the
      rostral or caudal poles. In NBM, more than half of all retrogradely labeled cells
      possessed axon collaterals projecting two or more PFC subregions. In LC, however,
      only 4.3% of retrogradely labeled neurons possessed collaterals targeting any two
      prefrontal subregions simultaneously, and no cells were identified that projected
      to all three regions. Of all labeled LC neurons, 49.3% projected only to mPFC,
      28.5% projected only to OFC, and 18.0% projected only to ACC. These findings
      suggest that subsets of LC neurons may be capable of modulating neuronal activity
      in individual prefrontal subregions independently, whereas assemblies of NBM
      cells may exert a more unified influence on the three areas, simultaneously. This
      work emphasizes unique aspects of the cholinergic and noradrenergic projections
      to functionally and anatomically distinct subregions of PFC and provides insights
      regarding global versus segregated regulation of prefrontal operations by these
      neuromodulatory pathways.

AB  - The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) is the G-protein coupled receptor responsible
      for the majority of the endocannabinoid signaling in the human brain. It is
      widely distributed in the limbic system, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, which are
      areas responsible for cognition, memory, and motor control. Because of this
      widespread distribution, it is not surprising that drugs that activate CB1R have 
      expected behavioral outcomes consistent with dysregulated signaling from these
      areas (e.g., memory loss, cognitive deficits, etc). In the context of this
      review, we present evidence for the role of CB1R signaling in the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC), an area involved in executive functions, with emphasis on the
      developmental regulation of CB1R signaling in the acquisition of mature PFC
      function. We further hypothesize how alterations in CB1R signaling specifically
      during adolescent maturation might confer liability to psychiatric disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Kana Pick-out Test (KPT), which uses Kana or Japanese symbols
      that represent syllables, requires parallel processing of discrete (pick-out) and
      continuous (reading) dual tasks. As a dual task, the KPT is thought to test
      working memory and executive function, particularly in the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC), and is widely used in Japan as a clinical screen for dementia.
      Nevertheless, there has been little neurological investigation into PFC activity 
      during this test. METHODS: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      to evaluate changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in
      young healthy adults during performance of a computerized KPT dual task
      (comprised of reading comprehension and picking out vowels) and compared it to
      its single task components (reading or vowel pick-out alone). RESULTS: Behavioral
      performance of the KPT degraded compared to its single task components.
      Performance of the KPT markedly increased BOLD signal intensity in the PFC, and
      also activated sensorimotor, parietal association, and visual cortex areas. In
      conjunction analyses, bilateral BOLD signal in the dorsolateral PFC (Brodmann's
      areas 45, 46) was present only in the KPT. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the
      central bottleneck theory and suggest that the dorsolateral PFC is an important
      mediator of neural activity for both short-term storage and executive processes. 
      Quantitative evaluation of the KPT with fMRI in healthy adults is the first step 
      towards understanding the effects of aging or cognitive impairment on KPT
      performance.

TI  - Self-organizing high-order cognitive functions in artificial agents: implications
      for possible prefrontal cortex mechanisms.
PG  - 76-87
LID - 10.1016/j.neunet.2012.04.005 [doi]
AB  - In our daily life, we often adapt plans and behaviors according to dynamically
      changing world circumstances, selecting activities that make us feel more
      confident about the future. In this adaptation, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is
      believed to have an important role, applying executive control on other cognitive
      processes to achieve context switching and confidence monitoring; however, many
      questions remain open regarding the nature of neural processes supporting
      executive control. The current work explores possible mechanisms of this
      high-order cognitive function, transferring executing control in the domain of
      artificial cognitive systems. In particular, we study the self-organization of
      artificial neural networks accomplishing a robotic rule-switching task analogous 
      to the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The obtained results show that behavioral
      rules may be encoded in neuro-dynamic attractors, with their geometric
      arrangements in phase space affecting the shaping of confidence. Analysis of the 
      emergent dynamical structures suggests possible explanations of the interactions 
      of high-level and low-level processes in the real brain.

AB  - Switching flexibly between behavioral goals is a hallmark of executive control
      and requires integration of external and internal information. We recorded
      single-neuron correlates of different numerical representations (sensory-,
      working memory-, and rule-related activity) in the dorsal premotor area (PMd),
      the cingulate motor areas (CMA), and the ventral intraparietal sulcus (VIP) and
      compared them to previous recordings in the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Two 
      monkeys were trained to encode and memorize numerosities and flexibly switch
      between two abstract quantitative rules based on rule cues. Almost 20% of
      randomly selected PFC and PMd neurons significantly represented the numerical
      rule in a behaviorally relevant manner, approximately twice as many as in the CMA
      and VIP. Rule selectivity was significantly better for PMd neurons than for PFC
      cells. Seemingly at the expense of rule selectivity, however, sensory- and
      memory-related numerosity activity was greatly diminished compared with previous 
      delayed match-to-numerosity studies. These findings suggest the involvement of
      the frontal premotor areas in strategic planning such as rule following.
      Moreover, the results emphasize that the coding capacities of neurons in
      association cortical areas are far more dynamic depending on task demands than
      previously thought.

TI  - Choline supplementation and DNA methylation in the hippocampus and prefrontal
      cortex of rats exposed to alcohol during development.
PG  - 1701-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2012.01784.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some of the most frequent deficits seen in children with fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and in animal models of FASD are spatial memory
      impairments and impaired executive functioning, which are likely related to
      alcohol-induced alterations of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC),
      respectively. Choline, a nutrient supplement, has been shown in a rat model to
      ameliorate some of alcohol's teratogenic effects, and this effect may be mediated
      through choline's effects on DNA methylation. METHODS: Alcohol was given by
      intragastric intubation to rat pups during the neonatal period (postnatal days 2 
      to 10) (ET group), which is equivalent to the third trimester in humans and a
      period of heightened vulnerability of the brain to alcohol exposure. Control
      groups included an intubated control group given the intubation procedure without
      alcohol (IC) and a nontreated control group (NC). Choline or saline was
      administered subcutaneously to each subject from postnatal days 2 to 20. On
      postnatal day 21, the brains of the subjects were removed and assayed for global 
      DNA methylation patterning as measured by chemiluminescence using the cpGlobal
      assay in both the hippocampal region and PFC. RESULTS: Alcohol exposure caused
      hypermethylation in the hippocampus and PFC, which was significantly reduced
      after choline supplementation. In contrast, control animals showed increases in
      DNA methylation in both regions after choline supplementation, suggesting that
      choline supplementation has different effects depending upon the initial state of
      the brain. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to show changes in global DNA
      methylation of the hippocampal region and PFC after neonatal alcohol exposure.
      Choline supplementation impacts global DNA methylation in these 2 brain regions
      in alcohol-exposed and control animals in a differential manner. The current
      findings suggest that both alcohol and choline have substantial impact on the
      epigenome in the PFC and hippocampus, and future studies will be needed to
      describe which gene families are impacted in such a way that function of the
      nervous system is changed.

TI  - Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation during emotional anticipation and
      neuropsychological performance in posttraumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 360-71
LID - 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.1539 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with executive 
      or attentional dysfunction and problems in emotion processing. However, it is
      unclear whether these two domains of dysfunction are related to common or
      distinct neurophysiological substrates. OBJECTIVE: To examine the hypothesis that
      greater neuropsychological impairment in PTSD relates to greater disruption in
      prefrontal-subcortical networks during emotional anticipation. DESIGN:
      Case-control, cross-sectional study. SETTING: General community and hospital and 
      community psychiatric clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer sample of 37 women with
      PTSD related to intimate partner violence and 34 age-comparable healthy control
      women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) to examine neural responses during anticipation of negative and positive
      emotional images. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale was used to characterize 
      PTSD symptom severity. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition,
      Digit Symbol Test, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Color-Word Interference
      Test, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test were used to characterize
      neuropsychological performance. RESULTS: Women with PTSD performed worse on
      complex visuomotor processing speed (Digit Symbol Test) and executive function
      (Color-Word Interference Inhibition/Switching subtest) measures compared with
      control subjects. Posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with greater
      anterior insula and attenuated lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation during 
      emotional anticipation. Greater dorsolateral PFC activation (anticipation of
      negative images minus anticipation of positive images) was associated with lower 
      PTSD symptom severity and better visuomotor processing speed and executive
      functioning. Greater medial PFC and amygdala activation related to slower
      visuomotor processing speed. CONCLUSIONS: During emotional anticipation, women
      with PTSD show exaggerated activation in the anterior insula, a region important 
      for monitoring internal bodily state. Greater dorsolateral PFC response in PTSD
      patients during emotional anticipation may reflect engagement of cognitive
      control networks that are beneficial for emotional and cognitive functioning.
      Novel treatments could be aimed at strengthening the balance between cognitive
      control (dorsolateral PFC) and affective processing (medial PFC and amygdala)
      networks to improve overall functioning for PTSD patients.

AB  - Executive functions are processes that act in harmony to control behaviors
      necessary for maintaining focus and achieving outcomes. Executive dysfunction in 
      neuropsychiatric disorders is attributed to structural or functional pathology of
      brain networks involving prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its connections with other
      brain regions. The PFC receives innervations from different neurons associated
      with a number of neurotransmitters, especially dopamine (DA). Here we review
      findings on the contribution of PFC DA to higher-order cognitive and emotional
      behaviors. We suggest that examination of multifactorial interactions of an
      individual's genetic history, along with environmental risk factors, can assist
      in the characterization of executive functioning for that individual. Based upon 
      the results of genetic studies, we also propose genetic mapping as a probable
      diagnostic tool serving as a therapeutic adjunct for augmenting executive
      functioning capabilities. We conclude that preservation of the neurological
      underpinnings of executive functions requires the integrity of complex neural
      systems including the influence of specific genes and associated polymorphisms to
      provide adequate neurotransmission.

TI  - Multiple sclerosis: effects of cognitive rehabilitation on structural and
      functional MR imaging measures--an explorative study.
PG  - 932-40
LID - 10.1148/radiol.11111299 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate brain changes after cognitive rehabilitation in patients
      with clinically stable relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS) by using 
      neuropsychologic assessment and structural and functional magnetic resonance (MR)
      imaging techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted with approval 
      of the involved institutional review boards. Written informed consent was
      obtained from each participant. Twenty patients with RR MS and cognitive deficits
      at baseline were randomly assigned to undergo treatment (n = 10), which entailed 
      computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation of attention and information
      processing and executive functions, or to serve as a control subjects (n = 10)
      without cognitive rehabilitation. All patients underwent a standardized
      neuropsychologic assessment and MR imaging at baseline and after 12 weeks.
      Changes in gray matter (GM) volumes on three-dimensional T1-weighted images and
      changes in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) architecture on
      diffusion-weighted images were assessed. Changes in functional activity at
      functional MR imaging during the Stroop task and at rest were also investigated
      by using linear models. RESULTS: As compared with their performance at baseline, 
      the patients in the treatment group improved at tests of attention and
      information processing and executive functions. Neither structural modifications 
      to GM volume nor modifications to NAWM architecture were detected at follow-up in
      both groups. Functional MR imaging demonstrated modifications of the activity of 
      the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) during the Stroop task, as well as modifications of the activity of the
      anterior cingulum, PCC and/or precuneus, left dorsolateral PFC, and right
      inferior parietal lobule at rest in the treatment group compared with the control
      group. In the treatment group, functional MR imaging changes were correlated with
      cognitive improvement (P < .0001 to .01). CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation of attention
      and information processing and executive functions in RR MS may be effected
      through enhanced recruitment of brain networks subserving the trained functions.

TI  - The human ventromedial prefrontal cortex is critical for transitive inference.
PG  - 1191-204
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00203 [doi]
AB  - We hypothesized that the ventromedial pFC (vmPFC) is critical for making
      transitive inferences (e.g., the logical operation that if A > B and B > C, then 
      A > C). To test this, participants with focal vmPFC damage, brain-damaged
      comparison participants, and neurologically normal participants completed a
      transitive inference task consisting an ordered set of arbitrary patterns.
      Participants first learned through trial-and-error the relationships of the
      patterns (e.g., Pattern A > Pattern B, Pattern B > Pattern C). After initial
      learning, participants were presented with novel pairings, some of which required
      transitive inference (e.g., Pattern A > Pattern C from the relationship above).
      We observed that vmPFC damage led to a specific deficit in transitive inference, 
      suggesting that an intact vmPFC is necessary for making normal transitive
      inferences. Given the usefulness of transitivity in inferring social
      relationships, this deficit may be one of the basic features of social conduct
      problems associated with vmPFC damage.

TI  - Prefrontal neuromodulation by nicotinic receptors for cognitive processes.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1007/s00213-011-2596-6 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: The prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediates executive functions, a set of
      control processes that optimize performance on cognitive tasks. It enables
      appropriate decision-making and mediates adapted behaviors, all processes
      impaired in psychiatric or degenerative disorders. Key players of normal
      functioning of the PFC are neurotransmitter (NT) systems arising from subcortical
      nuclei and targeting PFC subareas and, also, neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine
      receptors (nAChRs). These ion channels, located on multiple cell compartments in 
      all brain areas, mediate direct cholinergic transmission and modulate the release
      of NTs that cross onto PFC neurons or interneurons. OBJECTIVE: We compiled
      current knowledge concerning the role of nAChRs in NT release, focusing on the
      PFC. We point out plausible mechanisms of interaction among PFC circuits
      implicated in executive functions and emphasized the role of beta2-containing
      nAChRs, the high-affinity receptors for acetylcholine (ACh). These receptors are 
      more directly implicated in behavioral flexibility either when located on PFC
      neurons or in the monoaminergic or cholinergic systems targeting the PFC.
      RESULTS: We shed light on potentially crucial roles played by nAChRs in complex
      interactions between local and afferent NTs. We show how they could act on
      cognition via PFC networks. CONCLUSIONS: nAChRs are crucial for decision-making, 
      during integration of emotional and motivational features, both mediated by
      different NT pathways in the PFC. We review the knowledge recently gained on
      cognitive functions in mice and our current understanding of PFC NT modulation.
      The combination of these data is expected to provide new hypotheses concerning
      the role of AChRs in cognitive processes.

TI  - The differential contributions of pFC and temporo-parietal cortex to multimodal
      semantic control: exploring refractory effects in semantic aphasia.
PG  - 778-93
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00184 [doi]
AB  - Aphasic patients with multimodal semantic impairment following pFC or
      temporo-parietal (TP) cortex damage (semantic aphasia [SA]) have deficits
      characterized by poor control of semantic activation/retrieval, as opposed to
      loss of semantic knowledge per se. In line with this, SA patients show
      "refractory effects"; that is, declining accuracy in cyclical word-picture
      matching tasks when semantically related sets are presented rapidly and
      repeatedly. This is argued to follow a build-up of competition between targets
      and distractors. However, the link between poor semantic control and refractory
      effects is still controversial for two reasons. (1) Some theories propose that
      refractory effects are specific to verbal or auditory tasks, yet SA patients show
      poor control over semantic processing in both word and picture semantic tasks.
      (2) SA can result from lesions to either the left pFC or TP cortex, yet previous 
      work suggests that refractory effects are specifically linked to the left
      inferior frontal cortex. For the first time, verbal, visual, and nonverbal
      auditory refractory effects were explored in nine SA patients who had pFC (pFC+) 
      or TP cortex (TP-only) lesions. In all modalities, patient accuracy declined
      significantly over repetitions. This refractory effect at the group level was
      driven by pFC+ patients and was not shown by individuals with TP-only lesions.
      These findings support the theory that SA patients have reduced control over
      multimodal semantic retrieval and, additionally, suggest there may be functional 
      specialization within the posterior versus pFC elements of the semantic control
      network.

TI  - The association between aerobic fitness and executive function is mediated by
      prefrontal cortex volume.
PG  - 811-9
LID - 10.1016/j.bbi.2011.11.008 [doi]
AB  - Aging is marked by a decline in cognitive function, which is often preceded by
      losses in gray matter volume. Fortunately, higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)
      levels are associated with an attenuation of age-related losses in gray matter
      volume and a reduced risk for cognitive impairment. Despite these links, we have 
      only a rudimentary understanding of whether fitness-related increases in gray
      matter volume lead to elevated cognitive function. In this cross-sectional study,
      we examined whether the association between higher aerobic fitness levels and
      elevated executive function was mediated by greater gray matter volume in the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). One hundred and forty-two older adults (mean age=66.6
      years) completed structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, CRF
      assessments, and performed Stroop and spatial working memory (SPWM) tasks. Gray
      matter volume was assessed using an optimized voxel-based morphometry approach.
      Consistent with our predictions, higher fitness levels were associated with: (a) 
      better performance on both the Stroop and SPWM tasks, and (b) greater gray matter
      volume in several regions, including the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC). Volume of the 
      right inferior frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus mediated the relationship
      between CRF and Stroop interference while a non-overlapping set of regions
      bilaterally in the DLPFC mediated the association between CRF and SPWM accuracy. 
      These results suggest that specific regions of the DLPFC differentially relate to
      inhibition and spatial working memory. Thus, fitness may influence cognitive
      function by reducing brain atrophy in targeted areas in healthy older adults.

TI  - Cholinergic control in developing prefrontal-hippocampal networks.
PG  - 17955-70
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2644-11.2011 [doi]
AB  - The cholinergic drive enhances input processing in attentional and mnemonic
      context by interacting with the activity of prefrontal-hippocampal networks.
      During development, acetylcholine modulates neuronal proliferation,
      differentiation, and synaptic plasticity, yet its contribution to the maturation 
      of cognitive processing resulting from early entrainment of neuronal networks in 
      oscillatory rhythms remains widely unknown. Here we show that cholinergic
      projections growing into the rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) toward the end of the
      first postnatal week boost the generation of nested gamma oscillations
      superimposed on discontinuous spindle bursts by acting on functional muscarinic
      but not nicotinic receptors. Although electrical stimulation of cholinergic
      nuclei increased the occurrence of nested gamma spindle bursts by 41%,
      diminishment of the cholinergic input by either blockade of the receptors or
      chronic immunotoxic lesion had the opposite effect. This activation of locally
      generated gamma episodes by direct cholinergic projections to the PFC was
      accompanied by indirect modulation of underlying spindle bursts via cholinergic
      control of hippocampal theta activity. With ongoing maturation and switch of
      network activity from discontinuous bursts to continuous theta-gamma rhythms,
      accumulating cholinergic projections acting on both muscarinic and nicotinic
      receptors mediated the transition from high-amplitude slow to low-amplitude fast 
      rhythms in the PFC. By exerting multiple actions on the oscillatory entrainment
      of developing prefrontal-hippocampal networks, the cholinergic input may refine
      them for later gating processing in executive and mnemonic tasks.

TI  - Where is ELSA? The early to late shift in aging.
PG  - 2542-53
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhr334 [doi]
AB  - Studies of cognitive and neural aging have recently provided evidence of a shift 
      from an early- to late-onset cognitive control strategy, linked with temporally
      extended activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). It has been uncertain, however,
      whether this age-related shift is unique to PFC and executive control tasks or
      whether the functional location might vary depending on the particular cognitive 
      processes that are altered. The present study tested whether an early-to-late
      shift in aging (ELSA) might emerge in the medial temporal lobes (MTL) during a
      protracted context memory task comprising both anticipatory cue (retrieval
      preparation) and retrieval probe (retrieval completion) phases. First, we found
      reduced MTL activity in older adults during the early retrieval preparation phase
      coupled with increased MTL activity during the late retrieval completion phase.
      Second, we found that functional connectivity between MTL and PFC regions was
      higher during retrieval preparation in young adults but higher during retrieval
      completion in older adults, suggesting an important interactive relationship
      between the ELSA pattern in MTL and PFC. Taken together, these results critically
      suggest that aging results in temporally lagged activity even in regions not
      typically associated with cognitive control, such as the MTL.

TI  - Dorsal-striatal 5-HT(2)A and 5-HT(2)C receptors control impulsivity and
      perseverative responding in the 5-choice serial reaction time task.
PG  - 633-45
LID - 10.1007/s00213-011-2581-0 [doi]
AB  - RATIONAL: Prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsal striatum are part of the neural
      circuit critical for executive attention. The relationship between 5-HT and
      aspects of attention and executive control is complex depending on experimental
      conditions and the level of activation of different 5-HT receptors within the
      nuclei of corticostriatal circuitry. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated
      which 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors in the dorsomedial-striatum (dm-STR)
      contribute to executive attention deficit induced by blockade of NMDA receptors
      in the PFC. MATERIALS AND RESULTS: Executive attention was assessed by the
      five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), which provides indices of
      attention (accuracy) and those of executive control over performance such as
      premature (an index of impulsivity) and perseverative responding. The effects of 
      targeted infusion in dm-STR of 100 and 300 ng/mul doses of the selective 5-HT(2A)
      antagonist M100907 and 1 and 3 mug/mul doses of 5-HT(2C) agonist Ro60-0175 was
      examined in animals injected with 50 ng/mul dose of a competitive NMDA receptor
      antagonist 3-(R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-phosphonic acid (CPP) in the mPFC. Blockade
      of NMDA receptors impaired accuracy as well as executive control as shown by
      increased premature and perseverative responding. The CPP-induced premature and
      perseverative over-responding were dose-dependently prevented by both M100907 and
      Ro60-0175. Both drugs partially removed the CPP-induced accuracy deficit but only
      at the highest dose tested. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that in the dorsal
      striatum, 5-HT by an action on 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors may integrate the 
      glutamate corticostriatal inputs critical for different aspects of the 5-CSRT
      task performance.

TI  - Atypical frontal lobe activity during verbal working memory in youth with a
      family history of alcoholism.
PG  - 98-104
LID - 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.10.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal brain functioning during verbal working memory (VWM) tasks
      has been shown in individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Since
      adolescents with a familial history of alcoholism (FHP) are at high risk for
      developing an AUD, it is important to consider whether atypical brain activity
      during VWM may help to explain FHP vulnerability toward developing alcoholism.
      METHODS: To that end, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined
      brain response during a VWM 2-back task in 19 FHP adolescents and 16 age and
      gender-matched family history negative (FHN) controls. RESULTS: Despite no group 
      differences in task accuracy, FHP youth had significantly slower average reaction
      time when making correct responses during the 2-back condition than FHN youth. In
      contrast to a vigilance control condition, while covarying for reaction time, FHP
      adolescents showed less activation during VWM than FHN youth in multiple areas of
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC)--a brain region crucial to intact working memory
      skills. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that even prior to heavy alcohol use, 
      FHP adolescents show atypical executive brain functioning during VWM, and that
      these differences are independent of slower working memory reaction time in FHP
      youth. Given the importance of working memory in numerous areas of day-to-day
      functioning, such as adaptive decision-making, these abnormalities may contribute
      to FHP youth vulnerability toward developing AUDs.

AB  - Higher-order executive tasks such as learning, working memory, and behavioral
      flexibility depend on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the brain region most
      elaborated in primates. The prominent innervation by serotonin neurons and the
      dense expression of serotonergic receptors in the PFC suggest that serotonin is a
      major modulator of its function. The most abundant serotonin receptors in the
      PFC, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT3A receptors, are selectively expressed in distinct
      populations of pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons, and play a critical
      role in modulating cortical activity and neural oscillations (brain waves).
      Serotonergic signaling is altered in many psychiatric disorders such as
      schizophrenia and depression, where parallel changes in receptor expression and
      brain waves have been observed. Furthermore, many psychiatric drug treatments
      target serotonergic receptors in the PFC. Thus, understanding the role of
      serotonergic neurotransmission in PFC function is of major clinical importance.
      Here, we review recent findings concerning the powerful influences of serotonin
      on single neurons, neural networks, and cortical circuits in the PFC of the rat, 
      where the effects of serotonin have been most thoroughly studied.

TI  - When control fails: influence of the prefrontal but not striatal dopaminergic
      system on behavioural flexibility in a change detection task.
PG  - 1028-33
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.10.012 [doi]
AB  - There is growing interest in understanding the neurobiological foundations of
      attention. To examine whether attentional processes in a change detection task
      are modulated by dopamine signalling, we investigated the influence of two
      polymorphisms, i.e. Val158Met (rs4680) in the catechol-O-methyl transferase
      (COMT) and a variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism (VNTR, rs28363170) in
      the dopamine transporter (DAT1). The COMT Met allele, which results in lower
      enzyme activity and therefore probably enhanced PFC dopamine signalling, was
      significantly associated with task-performance and modulated executive control:
      Homozygous Met/Met allele carriers had difficulties when performing a change
      detection task, particularly showing the greatest difficulties in case cognitive 
      and behavioural flexibility was necessary and the required reaction was not part 
      of the subject's primary task set. Contrary, no difference between the two
      genotype groups were evident, when an attentional conflict emerged and
      attentional control was needed for adequate responding. No association with
      variation in DAT1 was observed. The results indicate a dissociation of the
      prefrontal and striatal dopamine system for attentional control and behavioural
      flexibility in a change detection task: While prefrontal dopamine turnover seems 
      to modulate performance, putatively via difficulties in set shifting leading to
      behavioural inflexibility in COMT Met allele carriers, striatal dopamine turnover
      seems less important in this regard. With respect to other studies examining
      mechanisms of attentional functions in different paradigms, the results suggest
      that behavioural flexibility and attentional control as two executive
      subprocesses are differentially influenced by genetic polymorphisms within the
      dopaminergic system. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled
      'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder'.

TI  - Dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex in addiction: neuroimaging findings and
      clinical implications.
PG  - 652-69
LID - 10.1038/nrn3119 [doi]
AB  - The loss of control over drug intake that occurs in addiction was initially
      believed to result from disruption of subcortical reward circuits. However,
      imaging studies in addictive behaviours have identified a key involvement of the 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) both through its regulation of limbic reward regions and 
      its involvement in higher-order executive function (for example, self-control,
      salience attribution and awareness). This Review focuses on functional
      neuroimaging studies conducted in the past decade that have expanded our
      understanding of the involvement of the PFC in drug addiction. Disruption of the 
      PFC in addiction underlies not only compulsive drug taking but also accounts for 
      the disadvantageous behaviours that are associated with addiction and the erosion
      of free will.

TI  - The hierarchical organization of semantic memory: executive function in the
      processing of superordinate concepts.
PG  - 1870-8
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.08.072 [doi]
AB  - Research on the processing of objects at different hierarchical levels has
      suggested that understanding superordinate concepts (e.g. fruit), relative to
      basic level concepts (e.g. apple), requires greater semantic control demands.
      Yet, it is unclear which factors underlie this difference in executive
      processing. We built on previous research showing that superordinate concepts
      have less shared features among their members and therefore may involve higher
      semantic control requirements. To test this hypothesis, we developed an fMRI
      study in which we orthogonally manipulated feature sharedness (more shared vs.
      less shared) and concept level (superordinate vs. basic) in a sentence
      verification task. Sentences involving less shared features, relative to more
      shared features, significantly engaged the L lateral PFC. Importantly, sentences 
      that included superordinate concepts, relative to those with basic level
      concepts, also revealed a stronger response in L lateral PFC, along with
      posterior temporal gyrus activation. There was also a significant interaction
      between feature sharedness and concept level in several PFC regions and L
      posterior temporal areas. The results suggest that relative to basic level
      concepts, processing superordinate concepts requires extra semantic control in L 
      lateral PFC to coordinate information that is less shared by other members of the
      category level. These findings demonstrate that feature sharedness impacts the
      neural basis of semantic knowledge, and is a critical dimension in the processing
      of superordinate concepts.

AB  - There is equivocal support for the hypothesis that preference for later larger
      (LL) over sooner smaller (SS) monetary alternatives (e.g., $50 in four months
      over $30 today) is associated with functioning of the insula and the prefrontal
      cortex (especially the lateral PFC). In the present study, we re-examined overall
      neural correlates of choice using a procedure to minimize potential confounds
      between choice (which is necessarily not under experimental control) and
      valuation. In addition, we assessed whether choice-related brain activity is
      moderated by 1) overall level of delay discounting and 2) the degree of
      stochasticity in individuals' intertemporal choices. Twenty-one participants
      completed an individualized intertemporal choice task while brain activity was
      measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Across participants,
      LL choice was associated with activity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (dlPFC), left insula/inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), frontal pole and the anterior 
      cingulate cortex (ACC). Stochasticity positively moderated the LL>SS activity
      within the left insula and left IFG. Degree of discounting also interacted with
      choice related activity, but only outside the LL vs. SS main effect map (in the
      posterior cingulate cortex, and precentral/postcentral gyrus and left dlPFC).
      Main effect results are consistent with the notion that lateral prefrontal
      activity during intertemporal decisions bias selection in the direction of LL.
      Correlation findings indicate that choice related activity in the left insula and
      IFG is moderated by the stochasticity of intertemporal choices, and may reflect
      reduced "executive function" demands among highly consistent participants.

TI  - An analysis of rat prefrontal cortex in mediating executive function.
PG  - 417-31
LID - 10.1016/j.nlm.2011.07.002 [doi]
AB  - While it is acknowledged that species specific differences are an implicit
      condition of comparative studies, rodent models of prefrontal function serve a
      significant role in the acquisition of converging evidence on prefrontal function
      across levels of analysis and research techniques. The purpose of the present
      review is to examine whether the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in rats supports a
      variety of processes associated with executive function including working memory,
      temporal processing, planning (prospective coding), flexibility, rule learning,
      and decision making. Therefore, in this review we examined changes associated
      with working memory processes for spatial locations, visual objects, odors,
      tastes, and response domains or attributes, temporal processes including temporal
      order, sequence learning, prospective coding, behavioral flexibility associated
      with reversal learning and set shifting, paired associate learning, and decision 
      making based on effort, time discounting, and uncertainty following damage to the
      PFC in rats. In addition, potential parallel processes of executive function in
      monkeys and humans based on several theories of subregional differentiation
      within the PFC will be presented. Specifically, theories based on domain or
      attribute specificity (Goldman-Rakic, 1996), level of processing (Petrides,
      1996), rule learning based on complexity (Wise, Murray, & Gerfen, 1996),
      executive functions based on connectivity with other brain regions associated
      with top-down control (Miller & Cohen, 2001), are presented and applied to PFC
      function in rats with the aim of understanding subregional specificity in the rat
      PFC. The data suggest that there is subregional specificity within the PFC of
      rats, monkey and humans and there are parallel cognitive functions of the
      different subregions of the PFC in rats, monkeys and humans.

AB  - Causal reasoning is a ubiquitous feature of human cognition. We continuously seek
      to understand, at least implicitly and often explicitly, the causal scenarios in 
      which we live, so that we may anticipate what will come next, plan a potential
      response and envision its outcome, decide among possible courses of action in
      light of their probable outcomes, make midstream adjustments in our goal-related 
      activities as our situation changes, and so on. A considerable body of research
      shows that the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) is crucial for causal reasoning,
      but also that there are significant differences in the manner in which
      ventrolateral PFC, dorsolateral PFC, and anterolateral PFC support causal
      reasoning. We propose, on the basis of research on the evolution, architecture,
      and functional organization of the lateral PFC, a general framework for
      understanding its roles in the many and varied sorts of causal reasoning carried 
      out by human beings. Specifically, the ventrolateral PFC supports the generation 
      of basic causal explanations and inferences; dorsolateral PFC supports the
      evaluation of these scenarios in light of some given normative standard (e.g., of
      plausibility or correctness in light of real or imagined causal interventions);
      and anterolateral PFC supports explanation and inference at an even higher level 
      of complexity, coordinating the processes of generation and evaluation with
      further cognitive processes, and especially with computations of hedonic value
      and emotional implications of possible behavioral scenarios - considerations that
      are often critical both for understanding situations causally and for deciding
      about our own courses of action.

PG  - 738-51

AB  - A default mode network of brain regions is known to demonstrate coordinated
      activity during the resting state. While the default mode network is well
      characterized in adults, few investigations have focused upon its development. We
      scanned 9-13-year-old children with diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state
      functional magnetic resonance imaging. We identified resting-state networks using
      Independent Component Analysis and tested whether the functional connectivity
      between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) 
      depends upon the maturation of the underlying cingulum white matter tract. To
      determine the generalizability of this relationship, we also tested whether
      functional connectivity depends on white matter maturity between bilateral
      lateral prefrontal cortex (lateral PFC) within the executive control network. We 
      found a positive relationship between mPFC-PCC connectivity and fractional
      anisotropy of the cingulum bundle; this positive relationship was moderated by
      the age of the subjects such that it was stronger in older children. By contrast,
      no such structure-function relationship emerged between right and left lateral
      PFC. However, functional and structural connectivity of this tract related
      positively with cognitive speed, fluency, and set-switching neuropsychological
      measures.

TI  - From an executive network to executive control: a computational model of the
      n-back task.
PG  - 3598-619
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00047 [doi]
AB  - A paradigmatic test of executive control, the n-back task, is known to recruit a 
      widely distributed parietal, frontal, and striatal "executive network," and is
      thought to require an equally wide array of executive functions. The mapping of
      functions onto substrates in such a complex task presents a significant challenge
      to any theoretical framework for executive control. To address this challenge, we
      developed a biologically constrained model of the n-back task that emergently
      develops the ability to appropriately gate, bind, and maintain information in
      working memory in the course of learning to perform the task. Furthermore, the
      model is sensitive to proactive interference in ways that match findings from
      neuroimaging and shows a U-shaped performance curve after manipulation of
      prefrontal dopaminergic mechanisms similar to that observed in studies of genetic
      polymorphisms and pharmacological manipulations. Our model represents a formal
      computational link between anatomical, functional neuroimaging, genetic,
      behavioral, and theoretical levels of analysis in the study of executive control.
      In addition, the model specifies one way in which the pFC, BG, parietal, and
      sensory cortices may learn to cooperate and give rise to executive control.

AB  - Cognitive control functions ("executive functions" [EFs] such as attentional
      control, self-regulation, working memory, and inhibition) that depend on
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) are critical for success in school and in life. Many
      children begin school lacking needed EF skills. Disturbances in EFs occur in many
      mental health disorders, such as ADHD and depression. This chapter addresses
      modulation of EFs by biology (genes and neurochemistry) and the environment
      (including school programs) with implications for clinical disorders and for
      education. Unusual properties of the prefrontal dopamine system contribute to
      PFC's vulnerability to environmental and genetic variations that have little
      effect elsewhere. EFs depend on a late-maturing brain region (PFC), yet they can 
      be improved even in infants and preschoolers, without specialists or fancy
      equipment. Research shows that activities often squeezed out of school curricula 
      (play, physical education, and the arts) rather than detracting from academic
      achievement help improve EFs and enhance academic outcomes. Such practices may
      also head off problems before they lead to diagnoses of EF impairments, including
      ADHD. Many issues are not simply education issues or health issues; they are
      both.

AB  - Methamphetamine (MA) is an abused stimulant which can result in cognitive
      deficits and monoamine depletions. Animal models of neurotoxic MA exposure show
      reductions in dopamine, serotonin, and their associated transporters. MA abuse
      can result in long-term attention, working memory, and executive function
      deficits in humans and deficits in route-based egocentric learning, novel object 
      recognition, and novel odor preference in rodents. MA has also been shown to
      affect brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in humans and rodents. This
      experiment examined the effects of a MA binge dosing regimen (10 mg/kg x 4 at 2 h
      intervals, s.c.) in Sprague-Dawley rats on BDNF, tropomyosin receptor kinase B
      (TrkB), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA expression, and plasma corticosterone.
      Tissues were collected 1, 7, and 24 h following the last MA dose. Expression of
      BDNF and TrkB mRNA was analyzed using in situ hybridization with cRNA probes.
      Frontal, parietal, and entorhinal cortical BDNF mRNA expression were increased by
      MA exposure at all time-points. Increases in BDNF mRNA were also seen in the
      hippocampal CA1, prefrontal cortex (PFC), piriform cortex, and locus coeruleus
      but only at specific times. TrkB mRNA expression was modified in several
      subregions of the hippocampus as well as in PFC and striatum. TH mRNA was
      increased at the 1 h time-point in the substantia nigra pars compacta with no
      differences noted at the other times. Corticosterone levels were increased at all
      three time-points. The findings suggest that BDNF and its receptor may be
      upregulated as a compensatory mechanism after MA exposure.

      Of Existing Networks and not Functional Reorganization.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have demonstrated
      altered neural recruitment, specifically within prefrontal cortex (PFC). This is 
      manifest typically as increased recruitment of homologous regions of PFC (e.g.,
      right ventrolateral PFC during performance of a verbal working memory task,
      possibly in response to damage involving the left PFC). The behavioral correlates
      of these functional changes are poorly understood. We used fMRI and multivariate 
      analytic methods to investigate changes in spatially distributed activity
      patterns and their behavioral correlates in a sample of TBI patients with diffuse
      axonal injury (DAI, but without focal injury) and matched healthy controls.
      Participants performed working memory tasks with varying memory load and
      executive demand. We identified networks within left and right PFC that uniquely 
      and positively correlated with performance in our control and TBI samples
      respectively, providing evidence of compensatory functional recruitment. Next we 
      combined brain-behavior and functional connectivity analyses to investigate
      whether compensatory brain changes were facilitated by functional reorganization 
      (i.e., recruitment of brain regions not engaged by our control sample) or altered
      functional engagement (i.e., differential recruitment of similar brain regions
      between the two groups based on task demands). In other words, does altered
      recruitment represent the instantiation of novel neural networks to support
      working memory performance after injury or the unmasking of extant, but
      behaviorally latent, functional connectivity? Our results support an altered
      functional engagement hypothesis. Areas within PFC that are normally coactivated 
      during working memory are behaviorally relevant at an earlier stage of difficulty
      for TBI patients as compared to controls. This altered functional engagement,
      also evident in the aging literature, is attributable to distributed changes
      owing to significant DAI.

AB  - Current understanding of the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders is limited;
      however, recent epidemiological studies demonstrate a strong correlation between 
      prenatal infection during pregnancy and the development of schizophrenia in adult
      offspring. In particular, schizophrenia patients subjected to prenatal infection 
      exhibit impairments in executive functions greater than schizophrenia patients
      not exposed to an infection while in utero. Acute prenatal treatment of rodents
      with the viral mimetic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) induces
      behavioural and neuropathological alterations in the adult offspring similar to
      schizophrenia. However, impairments on tasks of executive function that involve
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been rarely examined for the prenatal infection 
      model. Hence, we investigated the effects of acute prenatal injection of PolyI:C 
      (4.0 mg/kg, i.v., gestational day 15) on strategy set-shifting and reversal
      learning in an operant-based task. Our results show male, but not female,
      PolyI:C-treated adult offspring require more trials to reach criterion and
      perseverate during set-shifting. An opposite pattern was seen on the reversal day
      where the PolyI:C-treated male rats made fewer regressive errors. Females took
      more pre-training days and were slower to respond during the trials when compared
      to males regardless of prenatal treatment. The present findings validate the
      utility of the prenatal infection model for examining alterations of executive
      function, one of the most prominent cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.

TI  - Computational models of performance monitoring and cognitive control.
PG  - 658-77
AB  - The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been the subject of intense interest as a
      locus of cognitive control. Several computational models have been proposed to
      account for a range of effects, including error detection, conflict monitoring,
      error likelihood prediction, and numerous other effects observed with single-unit
      neurophysiology, fMRI, and lesion studies. Here, we review the state of
      computational models of cognitive control and offer a new theoretical synthesis
      of the mPFC as signaling response-outcome predictions. This new synthesis has two
      interacting components. The first component learns to predict the various
      possible outcomes of a planned action, and the second component detects
      discrepancies between the actual and intended responses; the detected
      discrepancies in turn update the outcome predictions. This single construct is
      consistent with a wide array of performance monitoring effects in mPFC and
      suggests a unifying account of the cognitive role of medial PFC in performance
      monitoring.

      system function.
PG  - 1227-36
LID - 10.1038/npp.2011.7 [doi]
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is essential for top-down control over higher-order
      executive function. In this study we demonstrate that the medial prefrontal
      cortex (mPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) differentially regulate VTA dopamine
      neuron activity, and furthermore, the pattern of activity in the PFC drastically 
      alters the dopamine neuron response. Thus, although single-pulse activation of
      the mPFC either excites or inhibits equivalent numbers of dopamine neurons,
      activation of the OFC induces a primarily inhibitory response. Moreover,
      activation of the PFC with a pattern that mimics spontaneous burst firing of
      pyramidal neurons produces a strikingly different response. Specifically,
      burst-like activation of the mPFC induces a massive increase in dopamine neuron
      firing, whereas a similar pattern of OFC activation largely inhibits dopamine
      activity. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the mPFC and OFC
      differentially regulate dopamine neuron activity, and that the pattern of
      cortical activation is critical for determining dopamine system output.

TI  - Developmental effects of reward on sustained attention networks.
PG  - 1693-704
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.072 [doi]
AB  - Adolescence is typified by significant maturation in higher-level attention
      functions coupled with less developed control over motivation, and enhanced
      sensitivity to novelty and reward. This study used event-related functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in seventy male and female participants aged
      between 10 and 43 years to identify age-related linear changes in cognitive
      sustained attention systems and the impact of reward on these systems, using a
      sustained attention task with and without a rewarded condition. For the
      non-rewarded sustained attention contrast, increasing age was associated with
      activation increases in typical regions of sustained attention including right
      inferior frontal, superior temporo-parietal and cerebellar cortices. Age-related 
      activation decreases were observed within more posterior regions including
      posterior cingulate, insula and posterior cerebellar cortices, presumably
      mediating visual-spatial saliency detection. The effect of reward on sustained
      attention networks was associated with increased activation with age in regions
      associated with both executive attention control and reward processing, including
      dorsolateral, inferior and ventromedial prefrontal cortices (PFC), striatum, and 
      temporo-parietal regions, suggestive of greater integration and executive control
      of motivation and cognition with maturity. Activation in paralimbic posterior
      cingulate and inferior temporal brain regions of visual-spatial saliency
      processing was progressively reduced in activation with increasing development.
      Thus, with increasing development between adolescence and adulthood, reward
      appears to enhance maturing cognitive sustained attention and executive
      reward-processing networks, whilst reducing paralimbic regions of saliency
      detection. These findings may be the neural underpinnings for the progressive
      maturation of motivational control over risk taking behaviours between
      adolescence and adulthood.

TI  - Executive functions and prefrontal cortex: a matter of persistence?
PG  - 3
LID - 10.3389/fnsys.2011.00003 [doi]
AB  - Executive function is thought to originates from the dynamics of frontal cortical
      networks. We examined the dynamic properties of the blood oxygen level dependent 
      time-series measured with functional MRI (fMRI) within the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) to test the hypothesis that temporally persistent neural activity underlies
      performance in three tasks of executive function. A numerical estimate of signal 
      persistence, the Hurst exponent, postulated to represent the coherent firing of
      cortical networks, was determined and correlated with task performance.
      Increasing persistence in the lateral PFC was shown to correlate with improved
      performance during an n-back task. Conversely, we observed a correlation between 
      persistence and increasing commission error - indicating a failure to inhibit a
      prepotent response - during a Go/No-Go task. We propose that persistence within
      the PFC reflects dynamic network formation and these findings underline the
      importance of frequency analysis of fMRI time-series in the study of executive
      functions.

LID - 10.1162/jocn.2011.21633 [doi]
AB  - Vividly remembering the past and imagining the future (mental time travel) seem
      to rely on common neural substrates and mental time travel impairments in
      patients with brain lesions seem to encompass both temporal domains. However,
      because future thinking-or more generally imagining novel events-involves the
      recombination of stored elements into a new event, it requires additional
      resources that are not shared by episodic memory. We aimed to demonstrate this
      asymmetry in an event generation task administered to two patients with lesions
      in the medial dorsal thalamus. Because of the dense connection with pFC, this
      nucleus of the thalamus is implicated in executive aspects of memory (strategic
      retrieval), which are presumably more important for future thinking than for
      episodic memory. Compared with groups of healthy matched control participants,
      both patients could only produce novel events with extensive help of the
      experimenter (prompting) in the absence of episodic memory problems. Impairments 
      were most pronounced for imagining personal fictitious and impersonal events.
      More precisely, the patients' descriptions of novel events lacked content and
      spatio-temporal relations. The observed impairment is unlikely to trace back to
      disturbances in self-projection, scene construction, or time concept and could be
      explained by a recombination deficit. Thus, although memory and the imagination
      of novel events are tightly linked, they also partly rely on different processes.

TI  - Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) is a simple tool for detecting executive
      deficits in chronic cannabis users.
PG  - 523-31
LID - 10.1080/13803395.2010.535505 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis is the most used illicit drug in the world, and its use has 
      been associated with prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction, including deficits in
      executive functions (EF). Considering that EF may influence treatment outcome, it
      would be interesting to have a brief neuropsychological battery to assess EF in
      chronic cannabis users (CCU). In the present study, the Frontal Assessment
      Battery (FAB), a brief, easy to use neuropsychological instrument aimed to
      evaluate EF, was used to evaluate cognitive functioning of CCU. METHODS: We
      evaluated 107 abstinent CCU with the FAB and compared with 44 controls matched
      for age, estimated IQ, and years of education. RESULTS: CCU performed poorly as
      compared to controls (FAB total score = 16.53 vs. 17.09, p < .05). CCU had also a
      poor performance in the Motor Programming subtest (2.47 vs. 2.73, p < .05).
      CONCLUSION: This study examined effects of cannabis in executive functioning and 
      showed evidence that the FAB is sensitive to detect EF deficits in early
      abstinent chronic cannabis users. Clinical significance of these findings remains
      to be investigated in further longitudinal studies. FAB may be useful as a
      screening instrument to evaluate the necessity for a complete neuropsychological 
      assessment in this population.

TI  - The role of the Met66 brain-derived neurotrophic factor allele in the recovery of
      executive functioning after combat-related traumatic brain injury.
PG  - 598-606
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1399-10.2011 [doi]
AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophin family,
      promotes survival and synaptic plasticity in the human brain. The Val66Met
      polymorphism of the BDNF gene interferes with intracellular trafficking,
      packaging, and regulated secretion of this neurotrophin. The human prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) shows lifelong neuroplastic adaption implicating the Val66Met BDNF
      polymorphism in the recovery of higher-order executive functions after traumatic 
      brain injury (TBI). In this study, we examined the effect of this BDNF
      polymorphism on the recovery of executive functioning after TBI. We genotyped a
      sample of male Vietnam combat veterans consisting of a frontal lobe lesion group 
      with focal penetrating head injuries and a non-head-injured control group for the
      Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System as a
      standardized psychometric battery was administrated to examine key domains of
      executive functions. The results revealed that the Met allele but not the
      hypothesized Val allele promotes recovery of executive functioning. Overall, the 
      Met66 carriers in the lesion group performed as well as the Met66 carriers in the
      control group. The Met66 allele accounted for 6.2% of variance for executive
      functioning independently of other significant predictors including preinjury
      intelligence, left hemisphere volume loss, and dorsolateral PFC volume loss. The 
      findings point to different mechanisms of the Val66Met BDNF gene in complex
      phenotypes under normal and pathological conditions. A better understanding of
      these mechanisms could be instrumental in the development and application of
      effective therapeutic strategies to facilitate recovery from TBI.

AB  - Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities are known to be impaired in schizophrenia and data
      from functional brain imaging studies showed that ToM deficit is correlated to
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction. Moreover, several lines of evidence suggest 
      a critical role for dopaminergic-serotoninergic interactions at the PFC level. In
      this view, we aimed to analyse the specific effect of the -1019C/G functional
      polymorphism of the serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1A-R), involved in both serotonin 
      and dopamine transmission regulation. A total of 118 clinically stabilised
      schizophrenia patients was assessed with a neuropsychological battery, including 
      evaluation of IQ, verbal memory, attention and executive function and a ToM task;
      they also underwent 5-HT1A-R genotyping. We observed a significant effect of the 
      5-HT1A-R genotype on ToM performances, with the CC genotype performing
      significantly better. The finding suggests an effect of the 5-HT1A-R polymorphism
      on ToM cognitive performance in schizophrenia patients, probably through complex 
      interactions between dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems, involved in
      mentalising.

      disorder: an fMRI investigation.
PG  - e46
LID - 10.1038/tp.2011.46 [doi]
AB  - Younger adults with anxiety disorders are known to show an attentional bias
      toward negative information. Little is known regarding the role of biased
      attention in anxious older adults, and even less is known about the neural
      substrates of any such bias. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was
      used to assess the mechanisms of attentional bias in late life by contrasting
      predictions of a top-down model emphasizing deficient prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      control and a bottom-up model emphasizing amygdalar hyperreactivity. In all, 16
      older generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients (mean age=66 years) and 12
      non-anxious controls (NACs; mean age=67 years) completed the emotional Stroop
      task to assess selective attention to negative words. Task-related fMRI data were
      concurrently acquired. Consistent with hypotheses, GAD participants were slower
      to identify the color of negative words relative to neutral, whereas NACs showed 
      the opposite bias, responding more quickly to negative words. During negative
      words (in comparison with neutral), the NAC group showed PFC activations, coupled
      with deactivation of task-irrelevant emotional processing regions such as the
      amygdala and hippocampus. By contrast, GAD participants showed PFC decreases
      during negative words and no differences in amygdalar activity across word types.
      Across all participants, greater attentional bias toward negative words was
      correlated with decreased PFC recruitment. A significant positive correlation
      between attentional bias and amygdala activation was also present, but this
      relationship was mediated by PFC activity. These results are consistent with
      reduced prefrontal attentional control in late-life GAD. Strategies to enhance
      top-down attentional control may be particularly relevant in late-life GAD
      treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Error processing is reflected, behaviorally, by slower reaction times
      (RT) on trials immediately following an error (post-error). Children with
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) fail to show RT slowing and
      demonstrate increased intra-subject variability (ISV) on post-error trials. The
      neural correlates of these behavioral deficits remain unclear. The dorsal
      anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) are key
      regions implicated in error processing and subsequent behavioral adjustment. We
      hypothesized that children with ADHD, compared to typically developing (TD)
      controls, would exhibit reduced PFC activation during post-error (versus
      post-correct inhibition) trials and reduced dACC activation during error (versus 
      correct inhibition) trials. METHODS: Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
      (fMRI) and a Go/No-Go task, we analyzed the neural correlates of error processing
      in 13 children with ADHD and 17 TD children. RESULTS: Behaviorally, children with
      ADHD showed similar RT slowing but increased ISV compared to controls. The
      post-error contrast revealed a relative increase in blood-oxygen-level dependent 
      (BOLD) signal in the middle/inferior temporal cortex (TempC), the
      ACC/supplementary motor area (SMA) and the somatosensory/auditory cortex (AudC)
      in children with ADHD compared to controls. Importantly, in the ADHD group,
      increased post-error temporal cortex activity was associated with lower ISV.
      During error (versus correct inhibition) trials, no between-group differences
      were detected. However, in children with ADHD lower ISV was associated with
      decreased insula and increased precentral gyrus activity. CONCLUSIONS: In
      children with ADHD, post-error neural activity suggests, first, a shift of
      attention towards task-irrelevant stimuli (AudC), and second, a recruitment of
      compensatory regions that resolve stimulus conflict (TempC) and improve response 
      selection/execution (ACC/SMA). ADHD children with higher temporal cortex
      activation showed lower ISV, suggesting that functional abnormalities in the
      compensatory temporal regions contribute to increased variability. Moreover,
      increased ISV may be related to an over-sensitivity to negative outcomes during
      error trials in ADHD (insula correlation).

AB  - This neuroimaging study examines the development of cognitive flexibility using
      the Change task in a sample of youths and adults. The Change task requires
      subjects to inhibit a prepotent response and substitute an alternative response, 
      and the task incorporates an algorithm that adjusts task difficulty in response
      to subject performance. Data from both groups combined show a network of
      prefrontal and parietal areas that are active during the task. For adults vs.
      youths, a distributed network was more active for successful change trials versus
      go, baseline, or unsuccessful change trials. This network included areas involved
      in rule representation, retrieval (lateral PFC), and switching (medial PFC and
      parietal regions). These results are consistent with data from previous
      task-switching experiments and inform developmental understandings of cognitive
      flexibility.

TI  - The impact of anxiety-inducing distraction on cognitive performance: a combined
      brain imaging and personality investigation.
PG  - e14150
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0014150 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous investigations revealed that the impact of task-irrelevant
      emotional distraction on ongoing goal-oriented cognitive processing is linked to 
      opposite patterns of activation in emotional and perceptual vs. cognitive
      control/executive brain regions. However, little is known about the role of
      individual variations in these responses. The present study investigated the
      effect of trait anxiety on the neural responses mediating the impact of transient
      anxiety-inducing task-irrelevant distraction on cognitive performance, and on the
      neural correlates of coping with such distraction. We investigated whether
      activity in the brain regions sensitive to emotional distraction would show
      dissociable patterns of co-variation with measures indexing individual variations
      in trait anxiety and cognitive performance. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
      Event-related fMRI data, recorded while healthy female participants performed a
      delayed-response working memory (WM) task with distraction, were investigated in 
      conjunction with behavioural measures that assessed individual variations in both
      trait anxiety and WM performance. Consistent with increased sensitivity to
      emotional cues in high anxiety, specific perceptual areas (fusiform gyrus--FG)
      exhibited increased activity that was positively correlated with trait anxiety
      and negatively correlated with WM performance, whereas specific executive regions
      (right lateral prefrontal cortex--PFC) exhibited decreased activity that was
      negatively correlated with trait anxiety. The study also identified a role of the
      medial and left lateral PFC in coping with distraction, as opposed to reflecting 
      a detrimental impact of emotional distraction. CONCLUSIONS: These findings
      provide initial evidence concerning the neural mechanisms sensitive to individual
      variations in trait anxiety and WM performance, which dissociate the detrimental 
      impact of emotion distraction and the engagement of mechanisms to cope with
      distracting emotions. Our study sheds light on the neural correlates of
      emotion-cognition interactions in normal behaviour, which has implications for
      understanding factors that may influence susceptibility to affective disorders,
      in general, and to anxiety disorders, in particular.

TI  - Improved modulation of rostrolateral prefrontal cortex using real-time fMRI
      training and meta-cognitive awareness.
PG  - 1298-305
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.12.016 [doi]
AB  - Recent real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) training studies have demonstrated that subjects 
      can achieve improved control over localized brain regions by using real-time
      feedback about the level of fMRI signal in these regions. It has remained
      unknown, however, whether subjects can gain control over anterior prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) regions that support some of the most complex forms of human
      thought. In this study, we used rt-fMRI training to examine whether subjects can 
      learn to regulate the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC), or the lateral
      part of the anterior PFC, by using a meta-cognitive awareness strategy. We show
      that individuals can achieve improved regulation over the level of fMRI signal in
      their RLPFC by turning attention towards or away from their own thoughts. The
      ability to achieve improved modulation was contingent on observing veridical
      real-time feedback about the level of RLPFC activity during training; a
      sham-feedback control group demonstrated no improvement in modulation ability and
      neither did control subjects who received no rt-fMRI feedback but underwent
      otherwise identical training. Prior to training, meta-cognitive awareness was
      associated with recruitment of anterior PFC subregions, including both RLPFC and 
      medial PFC, as well as a number of other midline and posterior cortical regions. 
      Following training, however, regulation improvement was specific to RLPFC and was
      not observed in other frontal, midline, or parietal cortical regions. These
      results demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring control over high-level
      prefrontal regions through rt-fMRI training and offer a novel view into the
      correspondence between observable neuroscientific measures and highly subjective 
      mental states.

LID - 10.1586/ern.10.133 [doi]
AB  - Neuropsychiatric disorders involve dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a 
      highly evolved brain region that mediates executive functioning. The dorsolateral
      PFC is specialized for regulating attention and behavior, while the ventromedial 
      PFC is specialized for regulating emotion. These abilities arise from PFC
      pyramidal cell networks that excite each other to maintain goals and rules 'in
      mind'. Imaging studies have shown reduced PFC gray matter, weaker PFC connections
      and altered PFC function in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder. Thus, medications that strengthen PFC network connections may be
      particularly useful for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      and related disorders. Recent data show that compounds such as guanfacine can
      enhance PFC function by stimulating postsynaptic alpha-2A receptors on the
      dendritic spines of PFC pyramidal cells where networks interconnect. Stimulation 
      of these receptors inhibits cAMP signaling, thus closing potassium channels and
      strengthening physiological connections. These actions may benefit patients with 
      weak PFC function.

TI  - Emotion processing in the aging brain is modulated by semantic elaboration.
PG  - 640-50
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.09.009 [doi]
AB  - The neural correlates of emotion processing have been shown to vary with age:
      older adults (OAs) exhibit increased frontal activations and, under some
      circumstances, decreased amygdala activations relative to young adults (YAs)
      during emotion processing. Some of these differences are additionally modulated
      by valence, with age-related biases toward positive versus negative stimuli, and 
      are thought to depend on OAs' capacity for controlled elaboration. However, the
      role of semantic elaboration in mediating valence effects in the aging brain has 
      not yet been explicitly tested. In the present study, YAs and OAs were scanned
      while they viewed negative, neutral, and positive pictures during either a deep, 
      elaborative task or a shallow, perceptual task. fMRI results reveal that
      emotion-related activity in the amygdala is preserved in aging and insensitive to
      elaboration demands. This study provides novel evidence that differences in
      valence processing are modulated by elaboration: relative to YAs, OAs show
      enhanced activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventrolateral PFC in 
      response to positive versus negative stimuli, but only during elaborative
      processing. These positive valence effects are predicted by individual
      differences in executive function in OAs for the deep but not shallow task.
      Finally, psychophysiological interaction analyses reveal age effects on
      valence-dependent functional connectivity between medial PFC and ventral
      striatum, as well as age and task effects on medial PFC-retrosplenial cortex
      interactions. Altogether, these findings provide support for the hypothesis that 
      valence shifts in the aging brain are mediated by controlled processes such as
      semantic elaboration, self-referential processing, and emotion regulation.

TI  - Poor creativity in frontotemporal dementia: a window into the neural bases of the
      creative mind.
PG  - 3733-42
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.09.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prefrontal cortex (PFC) supports functions critical for creative 
      thinking. Damage to the PFC is expected to impair creativity. Yet, previous works
      suggested the emergence of artistic talent in patients with frontotemporal lobar 
      degeneration (FTLD), which was interpreted as increased creativity. OBJECTIVE: We
      designed a study in patients with frontal variant (fv) of FTLD in order to verify
      whether: (1) creativity is impaired after frontal degeneration, (2) poor
      creativity is associated with frontal dysfunctions, and (3) poor creativity is
      related to hypoperfusion in specific PFC regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three
      groups of subjects were enrolled in the study: fvFTLD patients (n=17),
      non-demented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (n=12) and healthy controls
      (n=17). Participants performed a standardized test of creativity, the Torrance
      Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) and tests assessing frontal functions. Brain
      perfusion was correlated to fvFTLD patients' performance in the TTCT. RESULTS:
      Patients with fvFTLD were strongly impaired in all dimensions of the TTCT,
      compared to PD patients and controls. Disinhibited and perseverative responses
      were observed only in fvFTLD patients, leading to "pseudo-creative" responses.
      Poor creativity was positively correlated with several frontal tests. Poor
      creativity was also correlated with prefrontal hypoperfusion, particularly in the
      frontal pole. CONCLUSIONS: Poor creativity is associated with fvFTLD. The results
      also suggest that the integrity of the PFC (in particular frontopolar) is
      strongly associated with creative thinking. The emergence of artistic talent in
      patients with fvFTLD is explained by the release of involuntary behaviors, rather
      than by the development of creative thinking.

TI  - Fronto-striatal contribution to lexical set-shifting.
PG  - 1084-93
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhq182 [doi]
AB  - Fronto-striatal circuits in set-shifting have been examined in neuroimaging
      studies using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) that requires changing the
      classification rule for cards containing visual stimuli that differ in color,
      shape, and number. The present study examined whether this fronto-striatal
      contribution to the planning and execution of set-shifts is similar in a modified
      sorting task in which lexical rules are applied to word stimuli. Young healthy
      adults were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing
      the newly developed lexical version of the WCST: the Wisconsin Word Sorting Task.
      Significant activation was found in a cortico-striatal loop that includes area
      47/12 of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the caudate nucleus
      during the planning of a set-shift, and in another that includes the posterior
      PFC and the putamen during the execution of a set-shift. However, in the present 
      lexical task, additional activation peaks were observed in area 45 of the
      ventrolateral PFC area during both matching periods. These results provide
      evidence that the functional contributions of the various fronto-striatal loops
      are not dependent on the modality of the information to be manipulated but rather
      on the specific executive processes required.

PG  - 533-40

AB  - Anatomical and functional studies of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have identified 
      multiple PFC subregions. We argue that the PFC is involved in cognitive functions
      exceeding the sum of specific functions attributed to its subregions. These can
      be revealed either by lesions of the whole PFC, or more specifically by selective
      disconnection of the PFC from certain types of information (for example, visual) 
      allowing the investigation of PFC function in toto. Recent studies in macaque
      monkeys using the latter approach lead to a second conclusion: that the PFC, as a
      whole, could be fundamentally specialized for representing events that are
      extended in time. The representation of temporally complex events might underlie 
      PFC involvement in general intelligence, decision-making, and executive function.

TI  - Chronic smoking, but not acute nicotine administration, modulates neural
      correlates of working memory.
PG  - 29-42
LID - 10.1007/s00213-010-2013-6 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Beyond the amelioration of deprivation-induced impairments, and in
      contrast to effects on attentional processes, the cognitive-enhancing properties 
      of nicotine on working memory (WM) operations remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: In an
      effort to elucidate potential enhancing effects, we explored the impact of
      transdermal nicotine on neural functioning in minimally deprived smokers and, in 
      addition, assessed differences between smokers and non-smokers using a mixed
      block/event-related fMRI design that attempted to isolate specific central
      executive operations (attentional switch events) within general WM function (task
      blocks). METHODS: In task blocks, participants performed a continuous counting
      paradigm that required the simultaneous maintenance of, and frequent switching of
      attentional focus between, two running tallies in WM on some trials. Cigarette
      smokers (n = 30) were scanned twice, once each with a nicotine and placebo patch,
      while non-smokers (n = 27) were scanned twice with no patch. RESULTS: Across both
      groups, task blocks were associated with bilateral activation, notably in medial 
      and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior insula, and parietal regions,
      whereas individual attentional switch trials were associated with activation in a
      similar, but predominantly left-lateralized network. Within the smoker group,
      although nicotine increased heart rate, altered performance and mood, and reduced
      tobacco cravings, no acute drug (state-like) effect on brain activity was
      detected for either the task or switch effects. However, relative to non-smokers,
      smokers showed greater tonic activation in medial superior frontal cortex, right 
      anterior insula, and bilateral anterior PFC throughout task blocks (trait-like
      effect). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest smokers require recruitment of
      additional WM and supervisory control operations during task performance.

TI  - Prefrontal cortex and drug abuse vulnerability: translation to prevention and
      treatment interventions.
PG  - 124-49
LID - 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2010.09.001 [doi]
AB  - Vulnerability to drug abuse is related to both reward seeking and impulsivity,
      two constructs thought to have a biological basis in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
      This review addresses similarities and differences in neuroanatomy,
      neurochemistry and behavior associated with PFC function in rodents and humans.
      Emphasis is placed on monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitter systems located
      in anatomically distinct subregions: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); lateral
      prefrontal cortex (lPFC); anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); and orbitofrontal
      cortex (OFC). While there are complex interconnections and overlapping functions 
      among these regions, each is thought to be involved in various functions related 
      to health-related risk behaviors and drug abuse vulnerability. Among the various 
      functions implicated, evidence suggests that mPFC is involved in reward
      processing, attention and drug reinstatement; lPFC is involved in
      decision-making, behavioral inhibition and attentional gating; ACC is involved in
      attention, emotional processing and self-monitoring; and OFC is involved in
      behavioral inhibition, signaling of expected outcomes and reward/punishment
      sensitivity. Individual differences (e.g., age and sex) influence functioning of 
      these regions, which, in turn, impacts drug abuse vulnerability. Implications for
      the development of drug abuse prevention and treatment strategies aimed at
      engaging PFC inhibitory processes that may reduce risk-related behaviors are
      discussed, including the design of effective public service announcements,
      cognitive exercises, physical activity, direct current stimulation, feedback
      control training and pharmacotherapies. A major challenge in drug abuse
      prevention and treatment rests with improving intervention strategies aimed at
      strengthening PFC inhibitory systems among at-risk individuals.

      experimental examination.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/1744-9081-6-53 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dopamine in prefrontal cortex (PFC) modulates core cognitive
      processes, notably working memory and executive control. Dopamine regulating
      genes and polymorphisms affecting PFC--including Catechol-O-Methyltransferase
      (COMT) Val158Met--are crucial to understanding the molecular genetics of
      cognitive function and dysfunction. A mechanistic account of the COMT Val158Met
      effect associates the Met allele with increased tonic dopamine transmission
      underlying maintenance of relevant information, and the Val allele with increased
      phasic dopamine transmission underlying the flexibility of updating new
      information. Thus, consistent with some earlier work, we predicted that Val
      carriers would display poorer performance when the maintenance component was
      taxed, while Met carriers would be less efficient when rapid updating was
      required. METHODS: Using a Stroop task that manipulated level of required
      cognitive stability and flexibility, we examined reaction time performance of
      patients with schizophrenia (n = 67) and healthy controls (n = 186) genotyped for
      the Val/Met variation. RESULTS: In both groups we found a Met advantage for tasks
      requiring cognitive stability, but no COMT effect when a moderate level of
      cognitive flexibility was required, or when a conflict cost measure was
      calculated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support a simple
      stability/flexibility model of dopamine COMT Val/Met effects and suggest a
      somewhat different conceptualization and experimental operationalization of these
      cognitive components.

AB  - It is increasingly appreciated that executive control processes need to be
      understood in terms of motivational as well as cognitive mechanisms. The current 
      study examined the impact of performance-contingent reward incentives (monetary
      bonuses) on neural activity dynamics during cued task-switching performance.
      Behavioral measures indicated that performance was improved and task-switch costs
      selectively reduced on incentive trials. Trial-by-trial fluctuations in incentive
      value were associated with activation in reward-related brain regions
      (dopaminergic midbrain, paracingulate cortex) and also modulated the dynamics of 
      switch-selective activation in the brain cognitive control network. Within
      lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), both additive (inferior frontal junction) and
      interactive [dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC)] incentive effects were observed. In DLPFC,
      incentive modulation of activation predicted task-switching behavioral
      performance, but with hemispherically dissociable effects. Furthermore, in left
      DLPFC, incentive modulation specifically enhanced task-cue-related activation,
      and this activation in turn predicted that the trial would be subsequently
      rewarded (because of optimal performance). The results suggest that motivational 
      incentives have a selective effect on brain regions that subserve cognitive
      control processes during task-switching and, moreover, that one mechanism of
      effect might be the enhancement of cue-related task preparation within left
      DLPFC.

TI  - Updating of context in working memory: an event-related potential study.
PG  - 298-315
LID - 10.3758/CABN.10.2.298 [doi]
AB  - Flexible control of behavior depends on the representation, maintenance, and
      updating of context information in working memory, which is thought to rely on
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, in contrast to maintenance, the dynamics of
      context activation and updating have not been well studied. To identify neural
      signals associated with context updating, we compared event-related potentials
      associated with cues that did or did not provide task-relevant context
      information. The earliest effect of context was detected 200 msec following cue
      onset and had a scalp topography consistent with a generator in the PFC.
      Subsequent effects of context were detected at 400-700 msec following cue onset
      (P3b), with a broad scalp distribution spanning posterior areas, and during the
      final 300 msec preceding the target, with a probable generator in the medial
      frontal cortex. We propose that the effect of context on P2 is consistent with
      the onset of context updating in the PFC. Subsequent components may be indicative
      of activation of task-relevant posterior regions and context maintenance.

LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2010.04.039 [doi]
AB  - We compared reasoning about four-term analogy problems in the format (A:B::C: D) 
      to semantic and perceptual control conditions that required matching without
      analogical mapping. We investigated distinct phases of the problem solving
      process divided into encoding, mapping/inference, and response. Using fMRI, we
      assessed the brain activation relevant to each of these phases with an emphasis
      on achieving a better understanding of analogical reasoning relative to these
      other matching conditions. We predicted that the analogical condition would
      involve the most cognitive effort in the encoding and mapping/inference phases,
      while the control conditions were expected to engage greater prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) activation at the response period. Results showed greater activation for
      the analogical condition relative to the control conditions at the encoding phase
      in several predominantly left lateralized and medial areas of the PFC. Similar
      results were observed for the mapping/inference phase, though this difference was
      limited to the left PFC and rostral PFC. The response phase resulted in the
      fastest and most accurate responses in the analogy condition relative to the
      control conditions. This was accompanied by greater processing within the left
      lateral and the medial PFC for the control conditions relative to the analogy
      condition, consistent with most of the cognitive processing of the analogy
      condition having occurred in the prior task phases. Overall we demonstrate that
      the left ventral and dorsal lateral, medial, and rostral PFC are important in
      both the encoding of relational information, mapping and inference processes, and
      verification of semantic and perceptual responses in four term analogical
      reasoning.

PG  - S33-40

AB  - Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder associated with disruption of
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) development and executive dysfunction. To date, however, 
      there is little evidence directly linking these two sequelae of PKU. We utilized 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate prefrontal functioning
      in six individuals with early-treated PKU (ETPKU) during performance of an n-back
      working memory task and compared results with those of six age- and
      gender-matched neurologically intact individuals. In addition, we evaluated the
      possible presence of PKU-related disruptions in functional connectivity, as might
      be hypothesized based on prior reports of white matter injury in individuals with
      ETPKU. A number of brain regions, nearly half of which were located in the PFC,
      were found to show atypical neural activity in individuals with ETPKU during
      working memory performance. We also found decreased connectivity both within the 
      PFC as well as between the PFC and other brain regions in individuals with ETPKU 
      compared with controls. Results from this preliminary study suggest that both
      prefrontal dysfunction and disruptions in functional connectivity may contribute 
      to PKU-related executive impairment. In addition to advancing our understanding
      of PKU, the current findings have a broader impact in that PKU is regularly used 
      as a model of early prefrontal dysfunction in the study of other
      neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism).

PG  - 345-55
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.02.038 [doi]
AB  - Recent models hypothesize that adolescents' risky behavior is the consequence of 
      increased sensitivity to rewards in the ventral medial (VM) prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) and the ventral striatum (VS), paired with immature cognitive control
      abilities due to slow maturation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
      and lateral PFC. We tested this hypothesis with fMRI using a gambling task in
      which participants chose between Low-Risk gambles with a high probability of
      obtaining a small reward (1 Euro) and High-Risk gambles with a smaller
      probability of obtaining a higher reward (2, 4, 6, or 8 Euro). We examined neural
      responses during choice selection and outcome processing in participants from 4
      age groups (pre-pubertal children, early adolescents, older adolescents and young
      adults). High-Risk choices increased with rewards for all ages, but risk-taking
      decreased with age for low reward gambles. The fMRI results confirmed that
      High-Risk choices were associated with activation in VMPFC, whereas Low-Risk
      choices were associated with activation in lateral PFC. Activation in dorsal ACC 
      showed a linear decrease with age, whereas activation in VMPFC and VS showed an
      inverted U-shaped developmental pattern, with a peak in adolescence. In addition,
      behavioral differences in risk-taking propensity modulated brain activation in
      all age groups. These findings support the hypothesis that risky behavior in
      adolescence is associated with an imbalance caused by different developmental
      trajectories of reward and regulatory brain circuitry.

PG  - 1
LID - 10.1186/1751-0759-4-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was performed to examine whether patients with type 2
      diabetes have cognitive deficits associated with the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
      METHODS: Twenty-seven middle-aged patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes
      and 27 healthy controls underwent physical measurements and neuropsychological
      tasks. Response inhibition, reward prediction, and executive function were
      assessed by the Go/NoGo task, the reversal and extinction tasks, and the
      Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). To examine the interactions of being
      overweight with diabetes on cognitive performance, performance data were analysed
      by two-way ANCOVA with diabetes and overweight as factors and age as a covariate.
      RESULTS: Patients with type 2 diabetes showed significantly decreased response
      inhibition in the Go/NoGo task (discriminability index: P = 0.001). There was an 
      interaction of being overweight with diabetes on reaction time in the Go trials
      of the Go/NoGo task (P = 0.009). Being overweight was related to retained
      responses to the presentiment of reward in the extinction task (P = 0.029). The
      four groups showed normal cognitive performance in the WCST. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results showed that middle-aged, newly diagnosed and medication-free patients
      with type 2 diabetes have a particular neuropsychological deficit in inhibitory
      control of impulsive response, which is an independent effect of diabetes apart
      from being overweight.

AB  - Learning in a constant environment, and adapting flexibly to a changing one,
      through changes in reinforcement contingencies or valence-free cues, depends on
      overlapping circuitry that interconnects the prefrontal cortex (PFC) with the
      striatum and is subject to several forms of neurochemical modulation. We present 
      evidence from recent studies in animals employing electrophysiological,
      pharmacological and lesion techniques, and neuroimaging, neuropsychological and
      pharmacological investigations of healthy humans and clinical patients. Dopamine 
      (DA) neurotransmission in the medial striatum and PFC is critical for basic
      reinforcement learning and the integration of negative feedback during reversal
      learning, whilst orbitofrontal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) likely mediates this
      type of low level flexibility, perhaps by reducing interference from salient
      stimuli. The role of prefrontal noradrenaline (NA) in higher order flexibility
      indexed through attentional set-shifting has recently received significant
      empirical support, and similar avenues appear promising in the field of task
      switching.

AB  - Animals depend on learned rules to guide their actions. Prefrontal (PFC) and
      premotor (PMC) cortex of primates have been reported to display rule-related
      neural activity, but it is unclear how signals encoded here are utilized to
      enforce the decision to act. The supplementary eye field (SEF) is a candidate for
      enforcing rule-guided ocular decisions because the activity of neurons here is
      correlated with the rule in an ocular decision-making task and because this area 
      is anatomically more proximal to movement structures than PFC and PMC and
      receives inputs from them. However, in the previous work, the rule encoding and
      ocular outcome were confounded, leaving open the question of whether SEF activity
      is related to the rule or the behavior. In the present study, we attempted to
      discriminate between these alternatives by increasing task difficulty and forcing
      errors, thereby putting the stimulus and the behavior at odds. Single SEF neurons
      were recorded while monkeys performed the task in which the rule is to pursue a
      moving target if it intersects a visible square and maintain fixation if it does 
      not. A delay period was imposed to monitor neural activity while the target
      approached the square. Two complementary populations of go and nogo neurons were 
      found. When task difficulty was increased, the monkeys made more errors, and the 
      neurons took longer to encode the rule. However, in error trials, most neurons
      continued to reflect the rule rather the monkey's ocular decision in both the
      delay period and after square intersection (movement period). This was the case
      for both directionally tuned and nondirectional SEF neurons. The results suggest 
      that SEF neurons encode the ocular decision rule but that the decision itself
      likely occurs in a different structure that sums rule information from the SEF
      with information from other areas.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to modulate the neural network state in
      favor of the processing of task-relevant sensory information prior to the
      presentation of sensory stimuli. However, this proactive control mechanism cannot
      always optimize the network state because of intrinsic fluctuation of neural
      activity upon arrival of sensory information. In the present study, we have
      investigated an additional control mechanism, in which the control process to
      regulate the behavior is adjusted to the trial-by-trial fluctuation in neural
      representations of sensory information. We asked normal human subjects to perform
      a variant of the Stroop task. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we
      isolated cognitive conflict at a sensory processing stage on a single-trial basis
      by calculating the difference in activation between task-relevant and
      task-irrelevant sensory areas. Activation in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC)
      covaried with the neural estimate of sensory conflict only on incongruent trials.
      Also, the coupling between the DLPFC and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was
      tighter on high-sensory conflict trials with fast response. The results suggest
      that although detection of sensory conflict is achieved by the DLPFC, online
      behavioral adjustment is achieved by interactive mechanisms between the DLPFC and
      ACC.

TI  - The Scale of Functional Specialization within Human Prefrontal Cortex.
PG  - 1233-7
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3220-09.2010 [doi]
AB  - At what scale is it possible to observe consistent functional specialization
      within human prefrontal cortex (PFC), reproducible from one individual to the
      next? Some studies suggest gross functional divisions between large regions of
      PFC, but it is not known whether PFC exhibits specialization at the fine-grained 
      scale known to differentiate posterior cortical functions. We used fMRI to
      confirm a three-way segregation of function between three regions of medial
      anterior PFC, each centered on coordinates within 15 mm of the other two. Naive
      participants performed three tasks based on earlier studies, and we investigated 
      activity at regions defined by previous results. In each task, signal was
      significantly greater at the predicted region than the other two, just
      millimeters away. These results indicate reproducible functional specialization
      within PFC, at a much finer scale than previously demonstrated. Furthermore,
      these findings suggest that divergent results from previous studies may reflect
      the recruitment of functionally distinct regions and that "reverse inference"
      should be undertaken with caution.

AB  - The aim of this investigation was to evaluate improvement of executive functions 
      after shunt surgery in patients with early normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).
      Patients with NPH were assessed before and after shunt surgery with tests shown
      to be sensitive to damage to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Significant differences
      were found between basal and follow-up performances on the Boston Naming Test,
      the backwards digits span, Part B of the Trail Making Test, and the number of
      words produced on the phonological fluency task. In conclusion, our study reveals
      that patients with NPH who respond positively to continuous slow lumbar cerebral 
      spinal fluid drainage and receive a ventriculoperitoneal shunt implant, improve
      their performance on tasks of executive function. Due to the high demand for this
      form of mental processing in real-life complex scenarios, and based on the severe
      executive deficits present in both demented and non-demented NPH patients, we
      encourage the assessment of executive functions in this clinical group.

TI  - Activation of 5-HT(6) receptors facilitates attentional set shifting.
PG  - 13-21
LID - 10.1007/s00213-009-1701-6 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent executive function is disrupted in a
      range of psychiatric disorders and can be modelled in non-human primates and
      rodents using attentional set-shifting paradigms. There are few current
      pharmacological strategies for enhancing attentional set shifting, although the
      PFC is rich in relevant neurotransmitter targets, including 5-hydroxytryptamine
      (5-HT). Although 5-HT depletion studies do not support a role for 5-HT in
      attentional set shifting, the effect of 5-HT activation using specific receptor
      agonists has not been tested. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: This study investigated the
      effect of a novel, selective 5-HT(6) receptor agonist, WAY181187, in a rat model 
      of PFC-dependent extra-dimensional (ED) attentional set shifting. The effect of
      this agent on immediate early gene expression in the medial PFC and other regions
      was also examined. RESULTS: Compared to vehicle-injected controls, WAY181187
      facilitated ED set shifting but did not change other non-ED phases of the task
      (including intra-dimensional set shifting and reversal). This effect was blocked 
      by the selective 5-HT(6) antagonist SB399885, which alone had no effect.
      WAY181187 enhanced ED set shifting even when administered after the attentional
      set had been acquired, thereby ruling out impairments in attentional set
      formation. In separate experiments, at a dose that increased ED set shifting,
      WAY181187 increased Fos-like immunoreactivity in the medial PFC in a
      SB399885-sensitive manner, suggesting a 5-HT(6) receptor-mediated activation of
      this region. CONCLUSIONS: Through use of a novel 5-HT agonist, these experiments 
      reveal a previously unrecognised role for 5-HT activation in PFC-dependent
      executive function, mediated by 5-HT(6) receptor activation.

TI  - Prefrontal cortical contribution to risk-based decision making.
PG  - 1816-28
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhp250 [doi]
AB  - Damage to various regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) impairs decision making 
      involving evaluations about risks and rewards. However, the specific
      contributions that different PFC subregions make to risk-based decision making
      are unclear. We investigated the effects of reversible inactivation of 4
      subregions of the rat PFC (prelimbic medial PFC, orbitofrontal cortex [OFC],
      anterior cingulate, and insular cortex) on probabilistic (or risk) discounting.
      Rats were well trained to choose between either a "Small/Certain" lever that
      always delivered 1 food pellet, or another, "Large/Risky" lever, which delivered 
      4 pellets, but the probability of receiving reward decreased across 4 trial
      blocks (100%, 50%, 25%, and 12.5%). Infusions of gama-aminobutyric acid agonists 
      muscimol/baclofen into the medial PFC increased risky choice. However, similar
      medial PFC inactivations decreased risky choice when the Large/Risky reward
      probability increased over a session. OFC inactivation increased response
      latencies in the latter trial blocks without affecting choice. Anterior cingulate
      or insular inactivations were without effect. The effects of prelimbic
      inactivations were not attributable to disruptions in response flexibility or
      judgments about the relative value of probabilistic rewards. Thus, the prelimbic,
      but not other PFC regions, plays a critical role in risk discounting, integrating
      information about changing reward probabilities to update value representations
      that facilitate efficient decision making.

AB  - Neural systems of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) involved in executive functions are
      particularly vulnerable to sleep deprivation (SD). In this study, we investigated
      whether SD selectively affects specific components of the executive control
      processes involved in task-switching performance. Two different tasks are
      performed in rapid and random succession in this procedure, so that the
      to-be-executed task may change from one trial to the next (switch trial), or may 
      be repeated (repetition trial). Task-switches are usually slower than task
      repetitions, giving way to the 'switch cost'. One hundred and eight university
      students were assigned randomly to the sleep (S) or the SD group. Each of them
      was tested on a task-switching paradigm before and after an experimental night (S
      or SD), and after one recovery night. SD impaired both task-switching accuracy
      and speed. A higher proportion of errors and increased switch costs after SD have
      been observed, compared to normal sleep. Control analyses on switch and
      repetition trials showed that the SD group was significantly worse only on the
      switch trials. The effects of SD are reverted by one night of recovery sleep. It 
      is concluded that the ability to adjust behaviour rapidly and flexibly to
      changing environmental demands, which relies on the functional integrity of the
      PFC, is impacted negatively by sleep loss.

AB  - Cognitive aging studies have suggested that older adults show declines in both
      sustained and transient cognitive control processes. However, previous
      neuroimaging studies have primarily focused on age-related change in the
      magnitude, but not temporal dynamics, of brain activity. The present study
      compared brain activity dynamics in healthy old and young adults during task
      switching. A mixed blocked/event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
      design enabled separation of transient and sustained neural activity associated
      with cognitive control. Relative to young adults, older adults exhibited not only
      decreased sustained activity in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) during
      task-switching blocks but also increased transient activity on task-switch
      trials. Another pattern of age-related shift in dynamics was present in the
      lateral PFC (lPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), with younger adults
      showing a cue-related response during task-switch trials in lPFC and PPC, whereas
      older adults exhibited switch-related activation during the cue period in PPC
      only. In all 3 regions, these qualitatively distinct patterns of brain activity
      predicted qualitatively distinct patterns of behavioral performance across the 2 
      age groups. Together, these results suggest that older adults may shift from a
      proactive to reactive cognitive control strategy as a means of retaining
      relatively preserved behavioral performance in the face of age-related
      neurocognitive changes.

AB  - The role of the prefrontal Cortex (PFC) in higher cognitive functions - including
      working memory, conflict resolution, set shifting and semantic processing - has
      been demonstrated unequivocally. Despite the great heterogeneity among tasks
      measuring these phenotypes, due in part to the different cognitive sub-processes 
      implied and the specificity of the stimulus material used, there is agreement
      that all of these tasks recruit an executive control system located in the PFC.
      On a biochemical level it is known that the dopaminergic system plays an
      important role in executive control functions. Evidence comes from molecular
      genetics relating the functional COMT Val158Met polymorphism to working memory
      and set shifting. In order determine whether this pattern of findings generalises
      to linguistic and semantic processing, we investigated the effects of the COMT
      Val158Met polymorphism in lexical decision making using masked and unmasked
      versions of the semantic priming paradigm on N = 104 healthy subjects. Although
      we observed strong priming effects in all conditions (masked priming, unmasked
      priming with short/long stimulus asynchronies (SOAs), direct and indirect
      priming), COMT was not significantly related to priming, suggesting no reliable
      influence on semantic processing. However, COMT Val158Met was strongly associated
      with lexical decision latencies in all priming conditions if considered
      separately, explaining between 9 and 14.5% of the variance. Therefore, the
      findings indicate that COMT mainly influences more general executive control
      functions in the PFC supporting the speed of lexical decisions.

      pathophysiology: an important role for prefrontal cortex dysfunction.
PG  - 33-41

AB  - Recent advances in neurobiology have aided our understanding of attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The higher-order association cortices in the
      temporal and parietal lobes and prefrontal cortex (PFC) interconnect to mediate
      aspects of attention. The parietal association cortices are important for
      orienting attentional resources in time/space, while the temporal association
      cortices analyse visual features critical for identifying objects/places. These
      posterior cortices are engaged by the salience of a stimulus (its physical
      characteristics such as movement and colour). Conversely, the PFC is critical for
      regulating attention based on relevance (i.e. its meaning). The PFC is important 
      for screening distractions, sustaining attention and shifting/dividing attention 
      in a task-appropriate manner. The PFC is critical for regulating
      behaviour/emotion, especially for inhibiting inappropriate emotions, impulses and
      habits. The PFC is needed for allocating/planning to achieve goals and organizing
      behaviour/thought. These regulatory abilities are often referred to as executive 
      functions. In humans, the right hemisphere of the PFC is important for regulating
      distractions, inappropriate behaviour and emotional responses. Imaging studies of
      patients with ADHD indicate that these regions are underactive with weakened
      connections to other parts of the brain. The PFC regulates attention and
      behaviour through networks of interconnected pyramidal cells. These networks
      excite each other to store goals/rules to guide actions and are highly dependent 
      on their neurochemical environment, as small changes in the catecholamines
      noradrenaline (NA) or dopamine (DA) can have marked effects on PFC function. NA
      and DA are released in the PFC according to our arousal state; too little (during
      fatigue or boredom) or too much (during stress) impairs PFC function. Optimal
      amounts are released when we are alert/interested. The beneficial effects of NA
      occur at postsynaptic alpha(2A)-receptors on the dendritic spines of PFC
      pyramidal cells. Stimulation of these receptors initiates a series of chemical
      events inside the cell. These chemical signals lead to the closing of special ion
      channels, thus strengthening the connectivity of network inputs to the cell.
      Conversely, the beneficial effects of moderate amounts of DA occur at D(1)
      receptors, which act by weakening irrelevant inputs to the cells on another set
      of spines. Genetic linkage studies of ADHD suggest that these catecholamine
      pathways may be altered in some families with ADHD, e.g. alterations in the
      enzyme that synthesizes NA (DA beta-hydroxylase) are associated with weakened PFC
      abilities. Pharmacological studies in animals indicate catecholamine actions in
      the PFC are highly relevant to ADHD. Blocking NA alpha(2A)-receptors in the PFC
      with yohimbine produces a profile similar to ADHD: locomotor hyperactivity,
      impulsivity and poor working memory. Conversely, drugs that enhance
      alpha(2)-receptor stimulation improve PFC function. Guanfacine directly
      stimulates postsynaptic alpha(2A)-receptors in the PFC and improves functioning, 
      while methylphenidate and atomoxetine increase endogenous NA and DA levels and
      indirectly improve PFC function via alpha(2A)- and D(1) receptor actions.
      Methylphenidate and atomoxetine have more potent actions in the PFC than in
      subcortical structures, which may explain why proper administration of stimulant 
      medications does not lead to abuse. Further understanding of the neurobiology of 
      attention and impulse control will allow us to better tailor treatments for
      specific patient needs.

      schizophrenia.

AB  - CONTEXT: Prefrontal cortical dysfunction is frequently reported in schizophrenia.
      It remains unclear whether this represents the coincidence of several prefrontal 
      region- and process-specific impairments or a more unitary dysfunction in a
      superordinate cognitive control network. Whether these impairments are properly
      considered reflective of hypofrontality vs hyperfrontality remains unresolved.
      OBJECTIVES: To test whether common nodes of the cognitive control network exhibit
      altered activity across functional neuroimaging studies of executive cognition in
      schizophrenia and to evaluate the direction of these effects. DATA SOURCES:
      PubMed database. STUDY SELECTION: Forty-one English-language, peer-reviewed
      articles published prior to February 2007 were included. All reports used
      functional neuroimaging during executive function performance by adult patients
      with schizophrenia and reported whole-brain analyses in standard stereotactic
      space. Tasks primarily included the delayed match-to-sample, N-back, AX-CPT, and 
      Stroop tasks. DATA EXTRACTION: Activation likelihood estimation modeling reported
      activation maxima as the center of a 3-dimensional gaussian function in the
      meta-analysis, with statistical thresholding and correction for multiple
      comparisons. DATA SYNTHESIS: In within-group analyses, healthy controls and
      patients activated a similarly distributed cortical-subcortical network,
      prominently including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), ventrolateral
      PFC, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and thalamus. In between-group analyses,
      patients showed reduced activation in the left dorsolateral PFC, rostral/dorsal
      ACC, left thalamus (with significant co-occurrence of these areas), and
      inferior/posterior cortical areas. Increased activation was observed in several
      midline cortical areas. Activation within groups varied modestly by task.
      CONCLUSIONS: Healthy adults and schizophrenic patients activate a qualitatively
      similar neural network during executive task performance, consistent with the
      engagement of a general-purpose cognitive control network, with critical nodes in
      the dorsolateral PFC and ACC. Nevertheless, patients with schizophrenia show
      altered activity with deficits in the dorsolateral PFC, ACC, and mediodorsal
      nucleus of the thalamus. Increases in activity are evident in other PFC areas,
      which could be compensatory in nature.

AB  - Adult human studies suggest frontal dysfunction associated with chronic marijuana
      (MJ) use, but due to continued neuromaturation, adult studies may not generalize 
      to adolescents. This study characterized prefrontal cortex (PFC) morphometry in
      chronic MJ-using adolescents following 1 month of monitored abstinence. Data were
      collected from MJ users (n = 16) and controls (n = 16) aged 16-18. Extensive
      exclusionary criteria included co-morbid psychiatric and neurologic disorders.
      Substance use and anatomical measures were collected after 28 days of monitored
      abstinence. PFC volumes were ascertained from manual tracing by reliable raters
      on high-resolution magnetic resonance images. After controlling for lifetime
      alcohol use, gender and intracranial volume, MJ users did not differ from
      controls in PFC volume. However, marginal group-by-gender interactions were
      observed (P < 0.09): female MJ users demonstrated comparatively larger PFC
      volumes while male MJ users had smaller volumes compared with same-gender
      controls. Further, group status and total PFC volume interacted in predicting
      executive functioning (P < 0.05). Among MJ users, smaller PFC total volume was
      associated with better executive functioning while the opposite pattern was seen 
      among the controls. These preliminary results indicate that gender may moderate
      the relationship between MJ use and PFC morphometry. Given the relationship
      between larger PFC total volumes and poorer executive functioning among MJ users,
      female MJ users may be at increased risk for neurocognitive consequences. Future 
      research will measure PFC gray and white matter separately and follow boys and
      girls over adolescence to examine the influence of MJ use on neurodevelopment.

      prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved when subjects are engaged in various kinds of
      mentalising tasks. Although a large number of neuroimaging studies have been
      published, a relatively small amount of neuropsychological evidence supports
      involvement of the medial PFC in theory of mind reasoning. We recruited two
      neurological cases with damage to the medial PFC and initially performed the
      standard neuropsychological assessments for intelligence, memory, and executive
      functions. To examine theory of mind performance in these two cases, four kinds
      of standard and advanced tests for theory of mind were used, including first- and
      second-order false belief tests, the strange stories test, and the faux pas
      recognition test. Both patients were also requested to complete the questionnaire
      for the autism-spectrum quotient. Neither case showed impairment on standard
      theory of mind tests and only mild impairments were seen on advanced theory of
      mind tests. This pattern of results is basically consistent with previous
      studies. The most interesting finding was that both cases showed personality
      changes after surgical operations, leading to characteristics of autism showing a
      lack of social interaction in everyday life. We discuss herein the possible roles
      of the medial PFC and emphasize the importance of using multiple approaches to
      understand the mechanisms of theory of mind and medial prefrontal functions.

AB  - The neural correlates that relate auditory categorization to aspects of
      goal-directed behavior, such as decision-making, are not well understood. Since
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important role in executive function and the
      categorization of auditory objects, we hypothesized that neural activity in the
      PFC should predict an animal's behavioral reports (decisions) during a category
      task. To test this hypothesis, we tested PFC activity that was recorded while
      monkeys categorized human spoken words (Russ et al., 2008b). We found that
      activity in the ventrolateral PFC, on average, correlated best with the monkeys' 
      choices than with the auditory stimuli. This finding demonstrates a direct link
      between PFC activity and behavioral choices during a non-spatial auditory task.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a common polygenic disease in distinct populations, while
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is a rare autosomal dominant
      neurodegenerative disorder. Both diseases involve psychotic symptoms. SCA17 is
      caused by an expanded polyglutamine tract in the TATA box-binding protein (TBP)
      gene. In the present study, we investigated the association between schizophrenia
      and CAG repeat length in common TBP alleles with fewer than 42 CAG repeats in a
      Japanese population (326 patients with schizophrenia and 116 healthy controls).
      We found that higher frequency of alleles with greater than 35 CAG repeats in
      patients with schizophrenia compared with that in controls (p = 0.042). We also
      examined the correlation between CAG repeats length and age at onset of
      schizophrenia. We observed a negative correlation between the number of CAG
      repeats in the chromosome with longer CAG repeats out of two chromosomes and age 
      at onset of schizophrenia (p = 0.020). We further provided evidence that TBP
      genotypes with greater than 35 CAG repeats, which were enriched in patients with 
      schizophrenia, were significantly associated with hypoactivation of the
      prefrontal cortex measured by near-infrared spectroscopy during the tower of
      Hanoi, a task of executive function (right PFC; p = 0.015, left PFC; p = 0.010). 
      These findings suggest possible associations of the genetic variations of the TBP
      gene with risk for schizophrenia, age at onset and prefrontal function.

TI  - Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity predicts responsiveness to
      cognitive-behavioral therapy in schizophrenia.
PG  - 594-602
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.04.036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the variable response to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
      when added to antipsychotic medication in psychosis and the evidence for a role
      of pretherapy level of frontal lobe-based cognitive function in responsiveness to
      CBT in other disorders, this study examined whether pretherapy brain activity
      associated with working memory neural network predicts clinical responsiveness to
      CBT in schizophrenia. METHODS: Fifty-two outpatients stable on medication with at
      least one distressing symptom of schizophrenia and willing to receive CBT in
      addition to their usual treatment and 20 healthy participants underwent
      functional magnetic resonance imaging during a parametric n-back task.
      Subsequently, 26 patients received CBT for psychosis (CBT+treatment-as-usual
      [TAU], 19 completers) for 6-8 months, and 26 continued with TAU alone (17
      completers). Symptoms in both patient groups were assessed (blindly) at entry and
      follow-up. RESULTS: The CBT+TAU and TAU-alone groups did not differ clinically or
      in performance at baseline. The CBT+TAU group showed significant improvement in
      relation to the TAU-alone group, which showed no change, at follow-up. Stronger
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity (within the normal range) and
      DLPFC-cerebellum connectivity during the highest memory load condition (2-back > 
      0-back) were associated with post-CBT clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: DLPFC
      activity and its connectivity with the cerebellum predict responsiveness to CBT
      for psychosis in schizophrenia. These effects may be mediated by PFC-cerebellum
      contributions to executive processing.

TI  - Motivation and cognitive control in the human prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 939-45
LID - 10.1038/nn.2321 [doi]
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves cognitive control, that is, the ability to 
      select thoughts or actions in relation to internal goals. Little is known,
      however, about how the PFC combines motivation and the selection processes
      underlying cognitive control. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in
      humans and found that the medial and lateral PFC have a parallel hierarchical
      organization from posterior to anterior regions for motivating and selecting
      behaviors, respectively. Moreover, using functional connectivity analyses, we
      found that functional interactions in this parallel system from medial to lateral
      PFC regions convey motivational incentives on the basis of rewards/penalties
      regulating the differential engagement of lateral PFC regions in top-down
      selection. Our results indicate that motivation is a dissociable function, reveal
      how the PFC integrates motivation and cognitive control in the service of
      decision-making, and have major implications for current theories of prefrontal
      executive function.

PG  - 103-13
LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2009.05.080 [doi]
AB  - The goal of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to
      investigate whether and to what extent brain regions involved in high-confidence 
      recognition (HCR) versus low-confidence recognition (LCR) overlap or separate
      from each other. To this end, we performed conjunction analyses involving
      activations elicited during high-confidence hit, low-confidence hit, and
      high-confidence correct rejection responses. The analyses yielded 3 main
      findings. First, sensory/perceptual and associated posterior regions were common 
      to HCR and LCR, indicating contribution of these regions to both HCR and LCR
      activity. This finding may help explain why these regions are among the most
      common in functional neuroimaging studies of episodic retrieval. Second, medial
      temporal lobe (MTL) and associated midline regions were associated with HCR,
      possibly reflecting recollection-related processes, whereas specific prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) regions were associated with LCR, possibly reflecting executive
      control processes. This finding is consistent with the notion that the MTL and
      PFC networks play complementary roles during episodic retrieval. Finally, within 
      posterior parietal cortex, a dorsal region was associated with LCR, possibly
      reflecting top-down attentional processes, whereas a ventral region was
      associated with HCR, possibly reflecting bottom-up attentional processes. This
      finding may help explain why functional neuroimaging studies have found diverse
      parietal effects during episodic retrieval. Taken together, our findings provide 
      strong evidence that HCR versus LCR, and by implication, recollection versus
      familiarity processes, are represented in common as well as specific brain
      regions.

AB  - Good cognitive performance requires adherence to rules specific to the task at
      hand. Patients with neurological disease often make rule violation (RV) errors,
      but the anatomical basis for RV during cognitive testing remains debated. The
      present study examined the neuroanatomical correlates of RV errors made on tests 
      of executive functioning in 166 subjects diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease
      or as neurologically healthy. Specifically, RV errors were voxel-wisely
      correlated with gray matter volume derived from high-definition magnetic
      resonance images using voxel-based morphometry implemented in SPM2. Latent
      variable analysis showed that RV errors tapped a unitary construct separate from 
      repetition errors. This analysis was used to generate factor scores to represent 
      what is common among RV errors across tests. The extracted RV factor scores
      correlated with tissue loss in the lateral middle and inferior frontal gyri and
      the caudate nucleus bilaterally. When a more stringent control for global
      cognitive functioning was applied using Mini Mental State Exam scores, only the
      correlations with the right lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) remained significant.
      These data underscore the importance of right lateral PFC in behavioral
      monitoring and highlight the potential of RV error assessment for identifying
      patients with damage to this region.

AB  - A major challenge in research on executive control is to reveal its functional
      decomposition into underlying neural mechanisms. A typical assumption is that
      this decomposition occurs solely through anatomically based dissociations. Here
      we tested an alternative hypothesis that different cognitive control processes
      may be implemented within the same brain regions, with fractionation and
      dissociation occurring on the basis of temporal dynamics. Regions within lateral 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) were examined that, in a prior study, exhibited
      contrasting temporal dynamics between older and younger adults during performance
      of the AX-CPT cognitive control task. The temporal dynamics in younger adults fit
      a proactive control pattern (primarily cue-based activation), whereas in older
      adults a reactive control pattern was found (primarily probe-based activation).
      In the current study, we found that following a period of task-strategy training,
      these older adults exhibited a proactive shift within a subset of the PFC
      regions, normalizing their activity dynamics toward young adult patterns.
      Conversely, under conditions of penalty-based monetary incentives, the younger
      adults exhibited a reactive shift some of the same regions, altering their
      temporal dynamics toward the older adult baseline pattern. These experimentally
      induced crossover patterns of temporal dynamics provide strong support for dual
      modes of cognitive control that can be flexibly shifted within PFC regions, via
      modulation of neural responses to changing task conditions or behavioral goals.

AB  - Executive function is a term used to describe the cognitive processes subserved
      by the prefrontal cortex (PFC). An extensive body of work has characterized the
      effects of damage to the PFC in nonhuman primates, but it has focused primarily
      on the capacity of recognition and working memory. One limitation in studies of
      the functional parcellation of the PFC has been the absence of tests that assess 
      executive function or its functional components. The current study used an
      adaptation of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, a classic test of frontal lobe and
      executive function in humans, to assess the effects of bilateral lesions in the
      dorsolateral PFC on executive function in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). The
      authors used the category set-shifting task, which requires the monkey to
      establish a pattern of responding to a specific category (color or shape) based
      on reward contingency, maintain that pattern of responding, and then shift to
      responding to a different category when the reward contingency changes. Rhesus
      monkeys with lesions of the dorsolateral PFC were impaired in abstraction,
      establishing a response pattern to a specific category and maintaining and
      shifting that response pattern on the category set-shifting task.

      repeated ketamine exposure.

AB  - Treatment with non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists such as
      phencyclidine or ketamine have been shown to induce schizophrenia-like psychotic 
      and cognitive symptoms in humans and animals. However, there have been a number
      of contradictory findings regarding the effects of repeated treatment with these 
      drugs on working memory in experimental animals. We hypothesized that processes
      dependent on dopamine transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) may be
      more sensitive to disruption following these treatment. We assessed the effects
      of repeated treatment with ketamine on working memory performance using a delayed
      spatial win-shift procedure conducted on a radial-arm maze, dependent on a neural
      circuit linking hippocampal and dopamine inputs to the medial PFC. Rats were
      trained on the task prior to drug exposure, after which they were subjected to
      one of two dosing regimes of ketamine (30 mg/kg twice a day for either 5 or 10
      days). After a 10 day withdrawal period, they were re-tested on the task for 15
      days. Ketamine treatment for 10 days, but not 5 days, increased the number of
      errors and days to re-achieve the criterion on the delayed task. However, in a
      separate group of rats, subchronic ketamine treatment (10 days) did not affect
      performance of the non-delayed random foraging task, dependent on the
      hippocampus, but not the PFC. These results indicate that working memory
      performance assessed with these procedures is sensitive to disruption following
      repeated exposure to ketamine. Impairments in working memory induced by these
      treatments are not attributable to dysfunction of motivational, motor, short-term
      or spatial memory processes. The use of these procedures may prove useful in
      modeling impairments in this executive function observed in schizophrenia.

PG  - 5942-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0811431106 [doi]
AB  - Transcription of Bdnf is controlled by multiple promoters, which drive expression
      of multiple transcripts encoding for the same protein. Promoter IV contributes
      significantly to activity-dependent brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
      transcription. We have generated promoter IV mutant mice (BDNF-KIV) by inserting 
      a GFP-STOP cassette within the Bdnf exon IV locus. This genetic manipulation
      results in disruption of promoter IV-mediated Bdnf expression. BDNF-KIV animals
      exhibited significant deficits in GABAergic interneurons in the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC), particularly those expressing parvalbumin, a subtype implicated in
      executive function and schizophrenia. Moreover, disruption of promoter IV-driven 
      Bdnf transcription impaired inhibitory but not excitatory synaptic transmission
      recorded from layer V pyramidal neurons in the PFC. The attenuation of GABAergic 
      inputs resulted in an aberrant appearance of spike-timing-dependent synaptic
      potentiation (STDP) in PFC slices derived from BDNF-KIV, but not wild-type
      littermates. These results demonstrate the importance of promoter IV-dependent
      Bdnf transcription in GABAergic function and reveal an unexpected regulation of
      STDP in the PFC by BDNF.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampal 
      volume and executive functioning in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
      Prefrontal volume and hippocampal volume were studied using stereology in
      conjunction with point counting and voxel-based morphometry on MR images.
      Executive functioning was assessed using tests routinely incorporated into
      presurgical neuropsychological evaluation. Relative to 30 healthy controls, 43
      patients (26 left, 17 right) with TLE had volume atrophy of the ipsilateral
      hippocampus and bilateral dorsal PFC. Performance on the working memory index of 
      the Wechsler Memory Scale was positively correlated with the volume of all
      prefrontal regions, and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test with the left
      dorsal PFC, whole left PFC, and left hippocampus. Stroop Color-Word Interference 
      performance was not related to volume of dorsal PFC. The "extratemporal
      neuropsychological profile" frequently observed in patients with TLE may be due
      to extended damage to brain regions remote from the epileptogenic focus. In
      particular, volume atrophy of the dorsal PFC may account for deficits in
      executive functioning.

AB  - Altered levels of tonic/background dopamine in prefrontal cortex (PFC) may
      underlie modifications of executive cognitive function. We showed previously in
      rat PFC slices that exogenously supplied background dopamine facilitates
      induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), a possible cellular substrate for the 
      long-term component of executive cognitive function. In the present study, we
      characterized cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this modulatory
      dopamine effect. We show first that the LTP-facilitating effect of
      tonic/background dopamine follows an inverted-U shape concentration curve and
      that the effective level of background dopamine slowly activates postsynaptic
      extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) to facilitate LTP. Furthermore, we 
      show the evidence that LTP-inducing high-frequency stimulation evokes endogenous 
      release of dopamine in PFC slices. This fast dopamine serves as a trigger for LTP
      in the presence of the background dopamine. In its absence, the endogenous
      dopamine triggered, instead, long-term depression. These results indicate that
      appropriate levels of tonic/background dopamine serve to activate critical
      molecular factors in PFC neurons and thereby facilitate induction of synaptic
      potentiation.

      and goal-directed behavior, it remains unclear how goals influence executive
      processes. One possibility is that goal-relevant information, such as expected
      rewards, could modulate the representation of information relating to executive
      control, thereby ensuring the efficient allocation of cognitive resources. To
      investigate this, we examined how reward modulated spatial working memory. Past
      studies investigating spatial working memory have focused on dorsolateral PFC,
      but this area only weakly connects with areas processing reward. Ventrolateral
      PFC has better connections in this regard. Thus, we contrasted the functional
      properties of single neurons in ventrolateral and dorsolateral PFC as two
      subjects performed a task that required them to hold spatial information in
      working memory under different expectancies of reward for correct performance. We
      balanced the order of presentation of spatial and reward information so we could 
      assess the neuronal encoding of the two pieces of information independently and
      conjointly. Neurons in ventrolateral PFC encoded both spatial and reward
      information earlier, stronger and in a more sustained manner than neurons in
      dorsolateral PFC. Within ventrolateral PFC, spatial selectivity was more
      prevalent on the inferior convexity than within the principal sulcus. Finally,
      when reward increased spatial selectivity, behavioral performance improved,
      whereas when reward decreased spatial selectivity, behavioral performance
      deteriorated. These results suggest that ventrolateral PFC may be a locus whereby
      information about expected rewards can modulate information in working memory.
      The pattern of results is consistent with a role for ventrolateral PFC in
      attentional control.

AB  - Nicotine enhances attentional and working memory aspects of executive function in
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) where dopamine plays a major role. Here, we have
      determined the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes that can
      modulate dopamine release in rat PFC using subtype-selective drugs. Nicotine and 
      5-Iodo-A-85380 (beta2* selective) elicited [(3)H]dopamine release from both PFC
      and striatal prisms in vitro and dopamine overflow from medial PFC in vivo.
      Blockade by dihydro-beta-erythroidine supports the participation of beta2*
      nAChRs. However, insensitivity of nicotine-evoked [(3)H]dopamine release to
      alpha-conotoxin-MII in PFC prisms suggests no involvement of alpha6beta2* nAChRs,
      in contrast to the striatum, and this distinction is supported by
      immunoprecipitation of nAChR subunits from these tissues. The alpha7
      nAChR-selective agonists choline and Compound A also promoted dopamine release
      from PFC in vitro and in vivo, and their effects were enhanced by the alpha7
      nAChR-selective allosteric potentiator PNU-120596 and blocked by specific
      antagonists. DNQX and MK801 inhibited [(3)H]dopamine release evoked by choline
      and PNU-120596, suggesting crosstalk between alpha7 nAChRs, glutamate and
      dopamine in the PFC. In vivo, systemic (but not local) administration of
      PNU-120596, in the absence of agonist, facilitated dopamine overflow in the
      medial PFC, consistent with the activation of extracortical alpha7 nAChRs by
      endogenous acetylcholine or choline. These data establish that both beta2* and
      alpha7 nAChRs can modulate dopamine release in the PFC in vitro and in vivo.
      Through their distinct actions on dopamine release, these nAChR subtypes could
      contribute to executive function, making them specific therapeutic targets for
      conditions such as schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While many children with brain conditions present with cognitive,
      behavioural, emotional, academic and social impairments, other children recover
      with seemingly few impairments. Animal studies and preliminary child studies have
      identified timing of brain lesion as a key predictor in determining functional
      outcome following early brain lesions. REVIEW: This research suggests that
      knowledge of healthy developmental processes in brain structure and function is
      essential for better understanding functional recovery and outcome in children
      with brain lesions. This review paper aims to equip researchers with current
      knowledge of key principles of developmental processes in brain structure and
      function. Timetables for development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain
      region particularly vulnerable to lesions due to its protracted developmental
      course, are examined. In addition, timetables for development of executive
      skills, which emerge in childhood and have a prolonged developmental course that 
      parallels development of the PFC, are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Equipped with 
      this knowledge, researchers are now in a better position to understand functional
      recovery and outcome in children with brain conditions.

TI  - Stress-induced prefrontal reorganization and executive dysfunction in rodents.
PG  - 773-83
LID - 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.11.005 [doi]
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediates a range of higher order 'executive
      functions' that subserve the selection and processing of information in such a
      way that behavior can be planned, controlled and directed according to shifting
      environmental demands. Impairment of executive functions typifies many forms of
      psychopathology, including schizophrenia, mood and anxiety disorders and
      addiction, that are often associated with a history of trauma and stress. Recent 
      research in animal models demonstrates that exposure to even brief periods of
      intense stress is sufficient to cause significant structural remodeling of the
      principle projection neurons within the rodent PFC. In parallel, there is growing
      evidence that stress-induced alterations in PFC neuronal morphology are
      associated with deficits in rodent executive functions such as working memory,
      attentional set-shifting and cognitive flexibility, as well as emotional
      dysregulation in the form of impaired fear extinction. Although the molecular
      basis of stress-induced changes in PFC morphology and function are only now being
      elucidated, an understanding of these mechanisms could provide important insight 
      into the pathophysiology of executive dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disease and
      foster improved strategies for treatment.

TI  - Prefrontal cortex glutamate correlates with mental perspective-taking.
PG  - e3890
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0003890 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysfunctions in theory of mind and empathic abilities have been
      suggested as core symptoms in major psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia
      and autism. Since self monitoring, perspective taking and empathy have been
      linked to prefrontal (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) function,
      neurotransmitter variations in these areas may account for normal and
      pathological variations of these functions. Converging evidence indicates an
      essential role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in psychiatric diseases with
      pronounced deficits in empathy. However, the role of the glutamate system for
      different dimensions of empathy has not been investigated so far.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Absolute concentrations of cerebral glutamate in 
      the ACC, left dorsolateral PFC and left hippocampus were determined by 3-tesla
      proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in 17 healthy individuals. Three 
      dimensions of empathy were estimated by a self-rating questionnaire, the
      Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). Linear regression analysis showed that
      dorsolateral PFC glutamate concentration was predicted by IRI factor "perspective
      taking" (T = -2.710, p = 0.018; adjusted alpha-level of 0.017, Bonferroni) but
      not by "empathic concern" or "personal distress". No significant relationship
      between IRI subscores and the glutamate levels in the ACC or left hippocampus was
      detected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to investigate the
      role of the glutamate system for dimensions of theory of mind and empathy.
      Results are in line with recent concepts that executive top-down control of
      behavior is mediated by prefrontal glutamatergic projections. This is a
      preliminary finding that needs a replication in an independent sample.

AB  - This study investigated performance on the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System
      (D-KEFS) Tower Test in a sample of 12 patients with focal lesions in the lateral 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) and 12 control participants. PFC patients performed worse
      overall, spent more time on each move, and committed significantly more rule
      violations. The rule violation measure demonstrated 83% sensitivity and 100%
      specificity in the detection of lesions. Findings highlight the importance of
      error monitoring in the assessment of executive functioning. These preliminary
      results suggest that the lateral PFC may be critical for
      self-monitoring/inhibition and speed of processing in planning tasks.

TI  - The prefrontal cortex and the executive control of attention.
PG  - 489-97
LID - 10.1007/s00221-008-1642-z [doi]
AB  - We review two studies aimed at understanding the role of prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
      in the control of attention. The first study examined which attentional functions
      are critically dependent on PFC by removing PFC unilaterally and transecting the 
      forebrain commissures in two macaques. The monkeys fixated a central cue and
      discriminated the orientation of a colored target grating presented among colored
      distracter gratings in either the hemifield affected by the PFC lesion or the
      normal control hemifield. When the cue was held constant for many trials, task
      performance in the affected hemifield was nearly normal. However, performance was
      severely impaired when the cue was switched frequently across trials. The monkeys
      were unimpaired in a pop-out task with changing targets that did not require
      top-down attentional control. Thus, the PFC lesion resulted in selective
      impairment in the monkeys' ability to switch top-down control. In the second
      study, we used fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of top-down control in
      humans performing tasks identical to those used in the monkey experiments.
      Several fronto-parietal and posterior visual areas showed enhanced activation
      when attention was switched, which was greater on color cueing (top-down) trials 
      relative to pop-out trials. Taken together, our findings indicate that both
      frontal and parietal cortices are involved in generating top-down control signals
      for attentive switching, which may then be fed back to visual processing areas.
      The PFC in particular plays a critical role in the ability to switch attentional 
      control on the basis of changing task demands.

      receptors in human cognitive functions.
PG  - 12032-8
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3446-08.2008 [doi]
AB  - Dopamine D(1) receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are important for
      prefrontal functions, and it is suggested that stimulation of prefrontal D(1)
      receptors induces an inverted U-shaped response, such that too little or too much
      D(1) receptor stimulation impairs prefrontal functions. Less is known of the role
      of D(2) receptors in cognition, but previous studies showed that D(2) receptors
      in the hippocampus (HPC) might play some roles via HPC-PFC interactions. We
      measured both D(1) and D(2) receptors in PFC and HPC using positron emission
      tomography in healthy subjects, with the aim of elucidating how regional D(1) and
      D(2) receptors are differentially involved in frontal lobe functions and memory. 
      We found an inverted U-shaped relation between prefrontal D(1) receptor binding
      and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test performance. However, prefrontal D(2) binding has
      no relation with any neuropsychological measures. Hippocampal D(2) receptor
      binding showed positive linear correlations not only with memory function but
      also with frontal lobe functions, but hippocampal D(1) receptor binding had no
      association with any memory and prefrontal functions. Hippocampal D(2) receptors 
      seem to contribute to local hippocampal functions (long-term memory) and to
      modulation of brain functions outside HPC ("frontal lobe functions"), which are
      mainly subserved by PFC, via the HPC-PFC pathway. Our findings suggest that
      orchestration of prefrontal D(1) receptors and hippocampal D(2) receptors might
      be necessary for human executive function including working memory.

TI  - Do sex differences affect prefrontal cortex associated cognition in
      schizophrenia?
PG  - 255-61
LID - 10.1016/j.schres.2008.09.021 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, especially those related to prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) functions, influence functional outcome. There is evidence for sex
      differences in cognition in schizophrenia, but the results in the literature are 
      still controversial. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated different modalities of
      working memory (WM) and executive control (EC), functions that are both
      associated with the PFC, between sexes in schizophrenic patients and controls.
      METHODS: We used a battery of neuropsychological tests for assessing auditory,
      spatial, and visual-matching WM and used a dual task for assessing EC. The study 
      included 50 inpatients (25 female) partially remitted and taking atypical
      neuroleptics, as well as 40 controls (20 female) matched for age and education.
      RESULTS: Significant sex differences were found in the dual task; female patients
      detected fewer correct trials than male patients and controls did. Moreover,
      female patients performed significantly worse in the single visual subtest of the
      dual task. For the controls, no sex differences were found. Males showed higher
      positive symptoms than females, but no other differences in psychopathology,
      disease characteristics, or extrapyramidal symptoms were found between sexes.
      CONCLUSION: The present study shows an absence of sex differences in WM in
      healthy subjects and in patients with schizophrenia. However, in the dual task
      and in the single visual subtest, female patients performed worse than males.
      This finding suggests that in contrast to males, nonacute female inpatients show 
      an underlying attentional deficit that may contribute to impairment in
      higher-order functions such as EC.

TI  - The contributions of prefrontal cortex and executive control to deception:
      evidence from activation likelihood estimate meta-analyses.
PG  - 1557-66
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhn189 [doi]
AB  - Previous neuroimaging studies have implicated the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
      nearby brain regions in deception. This is consistent with the hypothesis that
      lying involves the executive control system. To date, the nature of the
      contribution of different aspects of executive control to deception, however,
      remains unclear. In the present study, we utilized an activation likelihood
      estimate (ALE) method of meta-analysis to quantitatively identify brain regions
      that are consistently more active for deceptive responses relative to truthful
      responses across past studies. We then contrasted the results with additional ALE
      maps generated for 3 different aspects of executive control: working memory,
      inhibitory control, and task switching. Deception-related regions in dorsolateral
      PFC and posterior parietal cortex were selectively associated with working
      memory. Additional deception regions in ventrolateral PFC, anterior insula, and
      anterior cingulate cortex were associated with multiple aspects of executive
      control. In contrast, deception-related regions in bilateral inferior parietal
      lobule were not associated with any of the 3 executive control constructs. Our
      findings support the notion that executive control processes, particularly
      working memory, and their associated neural substrates play an integral role in
      deception. This work provides a foundation for future research on the
      neurocognitive basis of deception.

TI  - Tolcapone enhances food-evoked dopamine efflux and executive memory processes
      mediated by the rat prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 521-30
LID - 10.1007/s00213-008-1342-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Genetic variations in catechol-O-methyl transferase
      (COMT) or administration of COMT inhibitors have a robust impact on cognition and
      executive function in humans. The COMT enzyme breaks down extracellular dopamine 
      (DA) and has a particularly important role in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) where
      DA transporters are sparse. As such, the beneficial cognitive effects of the COMT
      inhibitor tolcapone are postulated to be the result of increased bioavailability 
      of DA in the PFC. Furthermore, it has been shown previously that COMT inhibitors 
      increase pharmacologically evoked DA but do not affect basal levels in the PFC.
      OBJECTIVES: The current study characterized the ability of tolcapone to increase 
      DA release in response to behaviorally salient stimuli and improve performance of
      the delayed spatial win-shift (DSWSh) task. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Tolcapone
      enhanced PFC DA efflux associated with the anticipation and consumption of food
      when compared to saline controls. Chronic and acute treatment with tolcapone also
      reduced the number of errors committed during acquisition of the DSWSh. However, 
      no dissociable effects were observed in experiments designed to selectively assay
      encoding or recall in well-trained animals, as both experiments showed
      improvement with tolcapone treatment. Taken together, these data suggest a
      generalized positive influence on cognition. Furthermore, these data support the 
      conclusion of Apud and Weinberger (CNS Drugs 21:535-557, 2007) that agents which 
      selectively potentiate PFC DA release may confer cognitive enhancement without
      the unwanted side effects produced by drugs that increase basal DA levels in
      cortical and subcortical brain regions.

PG  - 1766-81
LID - 10.1162/jocn.2009.21132 [doi]
AB  - Past experience is hypothesized to reduce computational demands in PFC by
      providing bottom-up predictive information that informs subsequent
      stimulus-action mapping. The present fMRI study measured cortical activity
      reductions ("neural priming"/"repetition suppression") during repeated stimulus
      classification to investigate the mechanisms through which learning from the past
      decreases demands on the prefrontal executive system. Manipulation of learning at
      three levels of representation-stimulus, decision, and response-revealed
      dissociable neural priming effects in distinct frontotemporal regions, supporting
      a multiprocess model of neural priming. Critically, three distinct patterns of
      neural priming were identified in lateral frontal cortex, indicating that frontal
      computational demands are reduced by three forms of learning: (a) cortical tuning
      of stimulus-specific representations, (b) retrieval of learned stimulus-decision 
      mappings, and (c) retrieval of learned stimulus-response mappings. The
      topographic distribution of these neural priming effects suggests a rostrocaudal 
      organization of executive function in lateral frontal cortex.

PG  - 1483-8
LID - 10.1016/j.cub.2008.08.054 [doi]
AB  - The detection of stimuli is critical for an animal's survival [1]. However, it is
      not adaptive for an animal to respond automatically to every stimulus that is
      present in the environment [2-5]. Given that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a 
      key role in executive function [6-8], we hypothesized that PFC activity should be
      involved in context-dependent responses to uncommon stimuli. As a test of this
      hypothesis, monkeys participated in a same-different task, a variant of an
      oddball task [2]. During this task, a monkey heard multiple presentations of a
      "reference" stimulus that were followed by a "test" stimulus and reported whether
      these stimuli were the same or different. While they participated in this task,
      we recorded from neurons in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vPFC; a cortical
      area involved in aspects of nonspatial auditory processing [9, 10]). We found
      that vPFC activity was correlated with the monkeys' choices. This finding
      demonstrates a direct link between single neurons and behavioral choices in the
      PFC on a nonspatial auditory task.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Deficits in working memory are commonly observed after traumatic
      brain injury (TBI), with executive control processes preferentially impacted
      relative to storage and rehearsal. Previous activation functional neuroimaging
      investigations of working memory in patients with TBI have reported altered
      functional recruitment, but methodologic issues including sample heterogeneity
      (e.g., variability in injury mechanism, severity, neuropathology or chronicity), 
      underspecified definitions of "working memory," and behavioral differences
      between TBI and control groups have hindered interpretation of these changes.
      METHODS: Executive control processing in working memory was explicitly engaged
      during fMRI in a sample of carefully selected chronic-stage, moderate-to-severe
      TBI patients with diffuse axonal injury (DAI) but without focal lesions. RESULTS:
      Despite equivalent task performance, we observed a pattern of greater recruitment
      of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
      posterior cortices in our DAI sample. Enhanced activations were recorded in the
      left dorsolateral PFC (middle frontal gyrus), right ventrolateral PFC (inferior
      frontal gyrus), bilateral posterior parietal cortices, and left temporo-occipital
      junction. Region-of-interest analyses confirmed that these effects were robust
      across individual patients and could not be attributed to load factors or slowed 
      speed of processing. CONCLUSIONS: Augmented functional recruitment in the context
      of normal behavioral performance may be a neural marker of capacity or efficiency
      limits that can affect functional outcome after traumatic brain injury with
      diffuse injury.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has attracted a great research interest because of
      its involvement in the control of executive functions in both health and disease,
      and particularly in cognitive functions such as working memory. In schizophrenia,
      alterations in the PFC are documented at many different levels: molecular,
      cellular and functional. Furthermore, deficits in cognitive abilities are
      considered a core feature of schizophrenia and remain a major unmet medical need 
      with respect to this disorder. In order to understand the sites of action of
      currently used drugs, as well as of the new experimental treatments being
      developed and acting in this brain region, it is important to have a detailed
      knowledge of the corresponding chemical neuroanatomy. Here we review current
      knowledge regarding the cellular localization of 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(2A) and dopamine 
      D1, D5, and D2, D4 receptors in primate PFC and their possible functions in the
      neuronal circuits of the PFC.

      and dynamic causal modeling.
PG  - 645-55
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.08.002 [doi]
AB  - Functional imaging studies are indicating disrupted error monitoring and
      executive control in a fronto-cingulate network in major depression. However,
      univariate statistical analyses allow only for a limited assessment of directed
      neuronal interactions. Therefore, the present study used dynamic causal modeling 
      (DCM) of a fronto-cingulate network to re-analyze the data from a preceding fMRI 
      study in 16 drug-free patients with major depression and 16 healthy controls
      using the Stroop Color-Word Test (Wagner et al., 2006). In both groups, a
      significant reciprocal interregional connectivity was found in a cognitive
      control network including prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate
      cortex (ACC). With regard to intrinsic connections we detected a significant
      difference for dorsal to rostral ACC connectivity between depressive patients and
      controls in terms of higher connectivity in patients. Additionally, a task by
      group interaction was observed for the bilinear interaction signaling enhanced
      task-related input from the dorsal to rostral ACC in subjects with depression.
      This could be related to the inability of patients to down-regulate rostral ACC
      activation as observed in the previous univariate analysis. The correlation
      between interference scores and intrinsic connections from dorsal ACC to
      dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) was significant for both groups together, but no
      significant group differences in correlations could be detected. Thus, the
      observed relationship between control functions of the dorsal ACC exerted over
      DLPFC and interference scores appears to be valid in both patients with
      depression and controls. The findings are consistent with current models of a
      differential involvement of the fronto-cingulate system in the pathophysiology of
      major depression.

TI  - [Motivational control of learning in the prefrontal cortex].
PG  - 815-24
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is considered to be the center of executive
      control, also plays important roles in motivational operations. Neurons related
      to the expectancy of the presence or absence of a particular reward in a task
      situation are present in the primate lateral, medial and orbital PFC; these
      neurons show differential delay activity between reward and no-reward trials as
      well as showing differential delay activity between different types of reward
      trials. Reward expectancy-related neuronal activities reflect the motivation of
      animals to obtain the reward. Behavioral studies indicate that better learning is
      achieved when a more preferred reward is used. In primate lateral PFC neurons,
      cognitive task (e.g., working memory)-related activity is enhanced when a more
      preferred reward is used. Thus, motivation appears to modulate learning-related
      neuronal activity that in turn modulates learning-related behavior. Expectancies 
      of outcome can also be advantageous during learning if animals exhibit different 
      reactions for different outcomes, as different expectancies develop for different
      outcomes. Thus, differential outcome expectancies may facilitate learning and
      discriminative performance by providing the subject with an additional source of 
      information. Motivation is induced not only by homeostatic (such as food and
      liquid) but also by nonhomeostatic rewards (such as seeing and manipulating
      interesting objects). The expectancy of both types of rewards could modulate
      learning at both the neuronal and behavioral levels.

TI  - Functional brain abnormalities in psychiatric disorders: neural mechanisms to
      detect and resolve cognitive conflict and interference.
PG  - 96-124
LID - 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.06.003 [doi]
AB  - In the present article, we review functional neuroimaging studies on interference
      processing and performance monitoring in three groups of psychiatric disorders,
      (1) mood disorders, (2) schizophrenia, and (3) obsessive-compulsive disorder
      (OCD). Ad (1) Behavioral performance measures suggest an impaired interference
      resolution capability in symptomatic bipolar disorder patients. A series of
      neuroimaging analyses found alterations in the ACC-DLPFC system in mood disorder 
      (unipolar depressed and bipolar) patients, putatively reflective of an abnormal
      interplay of monitoring and executive neurocognitive functions. Other studies of 
      euthymic bipolar patients showed relatively decreased interference-related
      activation in rostroventral PFC which conceivably underlies defective inhibitory 
      control. Ad (2) Behavioral Stroop studies revealed a specific performance pattern
      of schizophrenia patients (normal RT interference but increased error
      interference and RT facilitation) suggestive of a deficit in ignoring irrelevant 
      (word) information. Moreover, reduced/absent behavioral post-error and
      post-conflict adaptation effects suggest alterations in performance monitoring
      and/or adjustment capability in these patients. Neuroimaging findings converge to
      suggest a disorder-related abnormal neurophysiology in ACC which consistently
      showed conflict- and error-related hypoactivation that, however, appeared to be
      modulated by different factors. Moreover, studies suggest a specific deficit in
      context processing in schizophrenia, evidently related to activation reduction in
      DLPFC. Ad (3) Behavioral findings provide evidence for impaired interference
      resolution in OCD. Neuroimaging results consistently showed conflict- and
      error-related ACC hyperactivation which--conforming OCD pathogenesis models--can 
      be conclusively interpreted as reflecting overactive performance monitoring.
      Taken together, interference resolution and performance monitoring appeared to be
      fruitful concepts in the investigation of neurocognitive deficits in psychiatric 
      disorders.

TI  - Plasticity and memory in the prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 29-46
AB  - Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies in humans have shown that the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in long-term memory functioning. In general, 
      the participation of the PFC in long-term memory has been attributed to its role 
      in executive control rather than information storage. Accumulating data from
      recent animal studies, however, suggest the possible role of the PFC in the
      storage of long-term memory. In support of this view, there is evidence that
      various projection systems in the PFC support long-term synaptic plasticity.
      Recording studies have further demonstrated neural correlates of learning in
      various animal species. Lastly, behavioral and physiological studies indicate
      that the PFC is critically involved in memory consolidation, retrieval and
      extinction processes. These studies then suggest that the PFC is an integral part
      of the neural network where long-term memory trace is stored and retrieved.
      Though decisive evidence is still lacking at present, we propose here to assign a
      term 'control memory' (i.e., memory for top-down control processes) as a new type
      of memory function for the PFC. This new principle of PFC-long-term memory can
      help organize existing data and provide novel insights into future empirical
      studies.

TI  - Improvement of prepulse inhibition and executive function by the COMT inhibitor
      tolcapone depends on COMT Val158Met polymorphism.
PG  - 3058-68
LID - 10.1038/npp.2008.82 [doi]
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that prepulse inhibition (PPI) levels relate to
      executive function possibly by a prefrontal cortex (PFC) dopamine (DA) link. We
      explored the effects of enhanced PFC DA signaling by the nonstimulant
      catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor tolcapone, on PPI and working
      memory of subjects homozygous for the Val (low PFC DA) and the Met (high PFC DA) 
      alleles of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism. Twelve Val/Val and eleven Met/Met
      healthy male subjects entered the study. Tolcapone 200 mg was administered in two
      weekly sessions, according to a balanced, crossover, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled design. PPI was assessed with 5 dB and 15 dB above background 
      prepulses, at 30-, 60-, and 120 ms prepulse-pulse intervals. Subjects also
      underwent the n-back and the letter-number sequencing (LNS) tasks. PPI was lower 
      in the Val/Val compared to the Met/Met group in the placebo condition. Tolcapone 
      increased PPI significantly in the Val/Val group and tended to have the opposite 
      effect in the Met/Met group. Baseline startle was not affected by tolcapone in
      the Val/Val group but it was slightly increased in the Met/Met group. Tolcapone
      improved performance in the n-back and LNS tasks only in the Val/Val group.
      Enhancement of PFC DA signaling with tolcapone improves both PPI and working
      memory in a COMT Val158Met genotype-specific manner. These results suggest that
      early information processing and working memory may both depend on PFC DA
      signaling, and that they may both relate to PFC DA levels according to an
      inverted U-shaped curve function.

TI  - Postnatal binge-like alcohol exposure reduces spine density without affecting
      dendritic morphology in rat mPFC.
PG  - 566-73
LID - 10.1002/syn.20532 [doi]
AB  - Among the deficits associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), cognitive
      impairments are the most debilitating and permanent. These impairments, including
      deficits in goal-directed behavior, attention, temporal planning, and other
      executive functions, could result from damage to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), an 
      area that has not been studied sufficiently in the context of FAS. Neuronal
      connectivity in this area, as measured by distribution of dendritic spines and
      the complexity of dendritic tree structure, can be influenced by exogenous
      variables other than alcohol, and the neuronal connectivity in other brain
      regions can be affected by alcohol exposure. The goal of this study was to
      determine whether binge-like alcohol exposure on postnatal days (PD) 4-9 affects 
      dendritic spine density and other dendritic tree parameters in mPFC that could
      possibly underlie functional damage. Rats were intubated with alcohol [5.25
      g/kg/day; alcohol exposed (AE)], sham intubated (SI), or remained with the mother
      (SC, suckle control) on PD 4-9. Animals were sacrificed between PD 26 and PD 30
      and brains were processed for Golgi-Cox staining. Apical dendrite complexity and 
      spine density were evaluated for layer III neurons in the mPFC using NeuroLucida 
      software (MicroBrightField, Inc.). Spine density was significantly decreased in
      AE animals relative to SI and SC controls, but no differences in dendritic
      complexity were found across experimental groups. Our findings demonstrate that
      neonatal alcohol exposure has a persistent effect on the spine density in mPFC
      that can explain functional deficits in this cortical area.

TI  - Prefrontal-inferotemporal interaction is not always necessary for reversal
      learning.
PG  - 5529-38
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0952-08.2008 [doi]
AB  - Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to have a wide-ranging role in cognition,
      often described as executive function or behavioral inhibition. A specific
      example of such a role is the inhibition of representations in more posterior
      regions of cortex in a "top-down" manner, a function thought to be tested by
      reversal learning tasks. The direct action of PFC on posterior regions can be
      directly tested by disconnecting PFC from the region in question. We tested
      whether PFC directly inhibits visual object representations in inferotemporal
      cortex (IT) during reversal learning by studying the effect, in macaque monkeys, 
      of disconnecting PFC from IT by crossed unilateral ablations. We tested two
      visual object reversal learning tasks, namely serial and concurrent reversal
      learning. We found that the disconnection severely impairs serial reversal
      learning but leaves concurrent reversal learning completely intact. Thus, PFC
      cannot be said to always have direct inhibitory control over visual object
      representations in reversal learning. Furthermore, our results cannot be
      explained by generalized theories of PFC function such as executive function and 
      behavioral inhibition, because those theories do not make predictions that
      differentiate different forms of reversal learning. The results do, however,
      support our proposal, based on other experimental evidence from macaque monkeys, 
      that PFC has a highly specific role in the representation of temporally complex
      events.

TI  - Differential prefrontal-like deficit in children after cerebellar astrocytoma and
      medulloblastoma tumor.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1186/1744-9081-4-18 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was realized thanks to the collaboration of children and
      adolescents who had been resected from cerebellar tumors. The medulloblastoma
      group (CE+, n = 7) in addition to surgery received radiation and chemotherapy.
      The astrocytoma group (CE, n = 13) did not receive additional treatments. Each
      clinical group was compared in their executive functioning with a paired control 
      group (n = 12). The performances of the clinical groups with respect to controls 
      were compared considering the tumor's localization (vermis or hemisphere) and the
      affectation (or not) of the dentate nucleus. Executive variables were correlated 
      with the age at surgery, the time between surgery-evaluation and the resected
      volume. METHODS: The executive functioning was assessed by means of WCST, Complex
      Rey Figure, Controlled Oral Word Association Test (letter and animal categories),
      Digits span (WISC-R verbal scale) and Stroop test. These tests are very sensitive
      to dorsolateral PFC and/or to medial frontal cortex functions. The scores for the
      non-verbal Raven IQ were also obtained. Direct scores were corrected by age and
      transformed in standard scores using normative data. The neuropsychological
      evaluation was made at 3.25 (SD = 2.74) years from surgery in CE group and at
      6.47 (SD = 2.77) in CE+ group. RESULTS: The Medulloblastoma group showed severe
      executive deficit (</= 1.5 SD below normal mean) in all assessed tests, the most 
      severe occurring in vermal patients. The Astrocytoma group also showed executive 
      deficits in digits span, semantic fluency (animal category) and moderate to
      slight deficit in Stroop (word and colour) tests. In the astrocytoma group, the
      tumor's localization and dentate affectation showed different profile and level
      of impairment: moderate to slight for vermal and hemispheric patients
      respectively. The resected volume, age at surgery and the time between
      surgery-evaluation correlated with some neuropsychological executive variables.
      CONCLUSION: Results suggest a differential prefrontal-like deficit due to
      cerebellar lesions and/or cerebellar-frontal diaschisis, as indicate the results 
      in astrocytoma group (without treatments), that also can be generated and/or
      increased by treatments in the medulloblastoma group. The need for differential
      rehabilitation strategies for specific clinical groups is remarked. The results
      are also discussed in the context of the Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      affects performance of the wisconsin card sorting task during provision of
      feedback.
PG  - 143238
LID - 10.1155/2008/143238 [doi]
AB  - Early functional neuroimaging studies of tasks evaluating executive processes,
      such as the Wisconsin card sorting task (WCST), only assessed trials in blocks
      that may contain a large amount of different cognitive processes. More recently, 
      we showed using event-related fMRI that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DL-PFC) significantly increased activity during feedback but not matching
      periods of the WCST, consistent with its proposed role in the monitoring of
      information in working memory. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) is a method that allows to disrupt processing within a given cortical
      region and to affect task performance for which this region is significantly
      solicited. Here we applied rTMS to test the hypothesis that the DL-PFC
      stimulation influences monitoring of working memory without interfering with
      other executive functions. We applied rTMS to the right DL-PFC and the vertex
      (control site) in different time points of the WCST. When rTMS was applied to the
      DL-PFC specifically during the period when subjects were receiving feedback
      regarding their previous response, WCST performance deteriorated, while rTMS did 
      not affect performance during matching either when maintaining set or during
      set-shifting. This selective impairment of the DL-PFC is consistent with its
      proposed role in monitoring of events in working memory.

TI  - Modelling prefrontal cortex deficits in schizophrenia: implications for
      treatment.
PG  - S465-70
LID - 10.1038/bjp.2008.24 [doi]
AB  - Current treatments of schizophrenia are compromised by their inability to treat
      all symptoms of the disease and their side-effects. Whilst existing antipsychotic
      drugs are effective against positive symptoms, they have negligible efficacy
      against the prefrontal cortex (PFC)-associated cognitive deficits and negative
      symptoms. New models that reproduce core pathophysiological features of
      schizophrenia are more likely to have improved predictive validity in identifying
      new treatments. We have developed a NMDA receptor antagonist model that
      reproduces core PFC deficits of schizophrenia and discuss this in relation to
      pathophysiology and treatments. Subchronic and chronic intermittent PCP (2.6
      mg/kg i.p.) was administered to rats. PFC activity was assessed by 2-deoxyglucose
      imaging, parvalbumin and Kv3.1 mRNA expression, and the attentional set-shifting 
      test (ASST) of executive function. Affymetrix gene array technology was employed 
      to examine gene expression profile patterns. PCP treatment reduced glucose
      utilization in the PFC (hypofrontality). This was accompanied by a reduction in
      markers of GABAergic interneurones (parvalbumin and Kv3.1 mRNA expression) and
      deficits in the extradimensional shift dimension of the ASST. Consistent with
      their clinical profile, the hypofrontality was not reversed by clozapine or
      haloperidol. Transcriptional analysis revealed patterns of change consistent with
      current neurobiological theories of schizophrenia. This model mirrors core
      neurobiological deficits of schizophrenia; hypofrontality, altered markers of
      GABAergic interneurone activity and deficits in executive function. As such it is
      likely to be a valuable translational model for understanding the neurobiological
      mechanisms underlying hypofrontality and for identifying and validating novel
      drug targets that may restore PFC deficits in schizophrenia.

      gestational cocaine exposure.
PG  - 371-7
LID - 10.1016/j.jpeds.2007.08.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of gestational cocaine exposure on the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). STUDY DESIGN:
      Using an n-back task, we obtained fMRI with a 3T Siemens scanner on 49
      adolescents, 25 who were exposed to cocaine and 24 who were not exposed. The
      primary outcome was PFC activation during task performance. Five functionally
      derived regions of interest (ROI) were defined; in addition, 2 a priori
      anatomical ROIs were generated for Brodmann regions 10 and 46. RESULTS: Of the 49
      adolescents who underwent imaging, data from 17 who were exposed to cocaine and
      17 who were not exposed were in the final analysis. Groups had similar
      performance on the n-back task (P >/= .4), with both showing a fewer number of
      correct responses on the 2-back than the 1-back (P < .001), indicating increased 
      demands on working memory with greater task difficulty. In functionally derived
      ROIs, imaging results showed increased activation for both groups in the 2-back
      versus the 1-back condition. In anatomical ROIs, both groups showed greater
      activation in the 2-back versus the 1-back condition, with activation in the
      non-exposed group proportionally greater for the left prefrontal region (P =
      .05). CONCLUSION: In this sample of adolescents, participants who were exposed to
      cocaine and participants who were not exposed were similar in performance on an
      executive function task and in fMRI activation patterns during task performance.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of error processing dysfunctions in major depressive
      disorder.
PG  - 179-88
LID - 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2007.19 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Depression is characterized by executive dysfunctions and abnormal
      reactions to errors; however, little is known about the brain mechanisms that
      underlie these deficits. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether abnormal reactions to
      errors in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are associated with
      exaggerated paralimbic activation and/or a failure to recruit subsequent
      cognitive control to account for mistakes in performance. DESIGN: Between
      February 15, 2005, and January 19, 2006, we recorded 128-channel event-related
      potentials while study participants performed a Stroop task, modified to
      incorporate performance feedback. SETTING: Patients with MDD and healthy
      comparison subjects were recruited from the general community. PARTICIPANTS:
      Study participants were 20 unmedicated patients with MDD and 20 demographically
      matched comparison subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The error-related negativity 
      and error positivity were analyzed through scalp and source localization
      analyses. Functional connectivity analyses were conducted to investigate group
      differences in the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain mechanisms that underlie
      error processing. RESULTS: Relative to comparison subjects, patients with MDD
      displayed significantly lower accuracy after incorrect responses, larger
      error-related negativity, and higher current density in the rostral anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Brodmann area 10/32)
      80 milliseconds after committing an error. Functional connectivity analyses
      revealed that for the comparison subjects, but not the patients with MDD, rostral
      ACC and medial PFC activation 80 milliseconds after committing an error predicted
      left dorsolateral PFC (Brodmann area 8/9) activation 472 milliseconds after
      committing an error. CONCLUSIONS: Unmedicated patients with MDD showed reduced
      accuracy and potentiated error-related negativity immediately after committing
      errors, highlighting dysfunctions in the automatic detection of unfavorable
      performance outcomes. New analytic procedures allowed us to show that abnormal
      reaction to committing errors was accompanied by hyperactivation in rostral ACC
      and medial PFC regions 80 milliseconds after committing errors and a failure to
      recruit dorsolateral PFC-based cognitive control. Future studies are warranted to
      investigate whether these dysfunctions might foster the emergence and maintenance
      of negative processing biases and thus increase vulnerability to depression.

TI  - Prefrontal contributions to domain-general executive control processes during
      temporal context retrieval.
PG  - 1088-103
AB  - Neuroimaging studies have reported increased prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity
      during temporal context retrieval versus recognition memory. However, it remains 
      unclear if these activations reflect PFC contributions to domain-general
      executive control processes or domain-specific retrieval processes. To gain a
      better understanding of the functional roles of these various PFC regions during 
      temporal context retrieval we propose it is necessary to examine PFC activity
      across tasks from different domains, in which parallel manipulations are included
      targeting specific cognitive processes. In the current fMRI study, we examined
      domain-general and domain-specific PFC contributions to temporal context
      retrieval by increasing stimulus (but maintaining response number) and increasing
      response number (but maintaining stimulus number) across temporal context memory 
      and ordering control tasks, for faces. The control task required subjects to
      order faces from youngest to oldest. Our behavioral results indicate that the
      combination of increased stimulus and response numbers significantly increased
      task difficulty for temporal context retrieval and ordering tasks. Across
      domains, increasing stimulus number, while maintaining response numbers, caused
      greater right lateral premotor cortex (BA 6/8) activity; whereas increasing
      response number, while maintaining stimulus number, caused greater domain-general
      left DLPFC (BA 9) and VLPFC (BA 44/45) activity. In addition, we found
      domain-specific right DLPFC (BA 9) activity only during retrieval events. These
      results highlight the functional heterogeneity of frontal cortex, and suggest its
      involvement in temporal context retrieval is related to its role in various
      cognitive control processes.

TI  - Activation of the prefrontal cortex during the Trail-Making Test detected with
      multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy.
PG  - 616-21
AB  - The Trail-Making Test (TMT) is a neuropsychological test for evaluating executive
      function, and the TMT Part B reflects more complex cognitive processes including 
      cognitive set shifting. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to be involved in 
      these cognitive processes. The purpose of the present paper was to investigate
      PFC activation during performance of the TMT Part A and Part B using multichannel
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Subjects were 41 healthy right-handed
      volunteers. The hemodynamic changes in the PFC during the TMT were measured on a 
      22-channel NIRS machine. The subjects had a greater increase of oxygenated
      hemoglobin ([oxyHb]) during the TMT Part B than during Part A in the PFC.
      Twenty-seven out of the 41 subjects had a bilateral increase of [oxyHb] in the
      PFC during Part B according to laterality index. NIRS detected activation in the 
      PFC during the performance of the TMT Part B and this PFC activation may reflect 
      executive functions including cognitive set shifting involved in the TMT Part B.

TI  - Stimulus specific deficit on visual reversal learning after lesions of medial
      prefrontal cortex in the mouse.
PG  - 405-10
AB  - Tests of executive abilities, such as discrimination reversal and attentional set
      shifting, are sensitive to prefrontal cortex (PFC) damage in primates. The
      purpose of the present study was to use a primate reversal task to determine if
      PFC in the mouse is involved in similar cognitive functions. Mice with lesions of
      medial PFC and Sham operated control animals were trained on a series of visual
      problems in a computer-automated touchscreen apparatus using stimuli that varied 
      in either pattern (lines) or luminance (black-white). PFC-lesioned mice learned
      to discriminate both sets of stimuli as readily as controls, but displayed a
      stimulus specific (pattern only) deficit on the reversal task. Analysis of error 
      patterns on the line reversal suggests the deficit exhibited by PFC-lesioned mice
      was related to stimulus specific aspects of visual attention, rather than
      perseveration. These results demonstrate that medial PFC may play a role in
      control of directed attention and provide further evidence that the touchscreen
      procedure can be a useful tool for examining functional similarities in brain
      regions of very diverse species.

TI  - Differential regulation of fronto-executive function by the monoamines and
      acetylcholine.
PG  - i151-60
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is innervated by the monoamines, dopamine (DA),
      noradrenaline (NA), and serotonin, as well as acetylcholine, and the marked
      influence of these neurochemical systems on prefrontal working memory processes
      has been widely described. However, their potentially, differential contribution 
      to prefrontal functioning is less well understood. This paper reviews evidence to
      support the hypothesis that these neurochemical systems recruit distinct
      fronto-executive operations. Direct comparison of the effects of manipulations of
      these neuromodulators within PFC on performance of an attentional set-shifting
      paradigm reveals their differential contribution to distinct task stages.
      Depletion of prefrontal serotonin selectively disrupts reversal learning but not 
      attentional set formation or set shifting. In contrast, depletion of prefrontal
      DA disrupts set formation but not reversal learning. NA depletion on the other
      hand specifically impairs set-shifting, whereas its effects on reversal learning 
      remain unclear. Finally, depletion of prefrontal acetylcholine has no effect on
      either set formation or set shifting but impairs serial reversal learning.
      Because these neurochemical systems are known to represent distinct states of
      stress, arousal, attention, and affect, it is postulated that they augment the
      different types of executive operation that are recruited and performed within
      these states via a synergistic interaction with the PFC.

TI  - Effects of aging on the electrophysiological properties of layer 5 pyramidal
      cells in the monkey prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 556-62
AB  - A significant decline in executive system function mediated by the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) often occurs with normal aging. In vitro slice studies have shown
      that layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the monkey PFC exhibit increased action
      potential (AP) firing rates which may, in part, contribute to this decline. Given
      that layer 5 cells also play a role in executive system function, it is important
      to determine if similar age-related changes occur in these cells. Whole-cell
      patch-clamp recordings in in vitro slices prepared from the PFC of young and aged
      behaviorally characterized rhesus monkeys were employed to answer this question. 
      Basic membrane and repetitive AP firing properties were unaltered with age. Aged 
      cells exhibited significantly decreased single AP amplitude, duration and fall
      time and increased slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) amplitude, but these
      changes were not associated with cognitive performance. This study demonstrates
      that layer 5 pyramidal cells, unlike layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, undergo only
      modest electrophysiological changes with aging, and that these changes are
      unlikely to contribute to age-related cognitive decline.

TI  - Coherence and recurrency: maintenance, control and integration in working memory.
PG  - 1-17
AB  - Working memory (WM), including a 'central executive', is used to guide behavior
      by internal goals or intentions. We suggest that WM is best described as a set of
      three interdependent functions which are implemented in the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC). These functions are maintenance, control of attention and integration. A
      model for the maintenance function is presented, and we will argue that this
      model can be extended to incorporate the other functions as well. Maintenance is 
      the capacity to briefly maintain information in the absence of corresponding
      input, and even in the face of distracting information. We will argue that
      maintenance is based on recurrent loops between PFC and posterior parts of the
      brain, and probably within PFC as well. In these loops information can be held
      temporarily in an active form. We show that a model based on these structural
      ideas is capable of maintaining a limited number of neural patterns. Not the
      size, but the coherence of patterns (i.e., a chunking principle based on
      synchronous firing of interconnected cell assemblies) determines the maintenance 
      capacity. A mechanism that optimizes coherent pattern segregation, also poses a
      limit to the number of assemblies (about four) that can concurrently reverberate.
      Top-down attentional control (in perception, action and memory retrieval) can be 
      modelled by the modulation and re-entry of top-down information to posterior
      parts of the brain. Hierarchically organized modules in PFC create the
      possibility for information integration. We argue that large-scale multimodal
      integration of information creates an 'episodic buffer', and may even suffice for
      implementing a central executive.

PG  - 143-52
AB  - Basic neuroscientific research has greatly contributed to a deeper understanding 
      of the cognitive functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Injuries of the PFC
      typically give rise to severe cognitive disorders that usually are subsumed under
      the broad rubric of executive dysfunctions (EDF). The umbrella term of EDF
      denotes a high-level disorder in the control of thought and action. The existence
      of EDF is of critical importance for the prognosis of disabilities in daily
      living, vocational rehabilitation, and social integration. Neuropsychological
      assessment instruments and intervention programs are discussed.

TI  - Strategic modulation of cognitive control.
PG  - 1302-15
AB  - The neural substrate of cognitive control is thought to comprise an evaluative
      component located in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and an executive
      component in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The control mechanism itself is mainly 
      local, triggered by response conflict (monitored by the ACC) and involving the
      allocation of executive resources (recruited by the PFC) in a trial-to-trial
      fashion. However, another way to achieve control would be to use a strategic
      mechanism based on long-term prediction of upcoming events and on a chronic
      response strategy that ignores local features of the task. In the current study, 
      we showed that such a strategic control mechanism was based on a functional
      dissociation or complementary relationship between the ACC and the PFC. When
      information in the environment was available to make predictions about upcoming
      stimuli, local task features (e.g., response conflict) were no longer used as a
      control signal. We suggest that having separate control mechanisms based on local
      or global task features allows humans to be persistent in pursuing their goals,
      yet flexible enough to adapt to changes in the environment.

TI  - Separating sustained from transient aspects of cognitive control during thought
      suppression.
PG  - 292-7
AB  - Cognitive theories of how people regulate their thoughts have suggested the
      involvement of two control processes that occur over different time courses.
      These cognitive accounts parallel recent neural models of executive control,
      which suggest that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediates sustained changes in the 
      allocation of control processes, whereas the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
      relays a transient need for additional control. Combining these cognitive and
      neural models of control, we used recently developed analysis techniques to
      distinguish transient from sustained changes in brain activation while subjects
      attempted to suppress an unwanted thought. Results were consistent with both
      models: Dorsolateral PFC demonstrated sustained increases in activation during
      attempts at thought suppression, whereas bilateral ACC demonstrated transient
      increases associated with occurrences of unwanted thoughts. These data support
      proposals regarding the different contributions made by the PFC and ACC to
      executive control and provide initial neuroimaging support for dual-process
      models of how individuals regulate their thoughts.

TI  - Serotonin2C receptor localization in GABA neurons of the rat medial prefrontal
      cortex: implications for understanding the neurobiology of addiction.
PG  - 1677-88
AB  - Serotonin (5-HT) action via the 5-HT(2C) receptor (5-HT(2C)R) provides an
      important modulatory influence over neurons of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which
      is critically involved in disorders of executive function including substance use
      disorders. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of the
      5-HT(2C)R in the rat prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL), a subregion of the medial
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC), using a polyclonal antibody raised against the
      5-HT(2C)R. The expression of 5-HT(2C)R immunoreactivity (IR) was highest in the
      deep layers (layers V/VI) of the mPFC. The 5-HT(2C)R-IR was typically most
      intense at the periphery of cell bodies and the initial segment of cell
      processes. Approximately 50% of the 5-HT(2C)R-IR detected was found in glutamate 
      decarboxylase, isoform 67 (GAD 67)-positive neurons. Of the subtypes of GABA
      interneurons identified by expression of several calcium-binding proteins, a
      significantly higher percentage of neurons expressing IR for parvalbumin also
      expressed 5-HT(2C)R-IR than did the percentage of neurons expressing calbindin-IR
      or calretinin-IR that also expressed 5-HT(2C)R-IR. Since parvalbumin is located
      in basket and chandelier GABA interneurons which project to cell body and initial
      axon segments of pyramidal cells, respectively, these results raise the
      possibility that the 5-HT(2C)R in the mPFC acts via the parvalbumin-positive
      GABAergic interneurons to regulate the output of pyramidal cells in the rat mPFC.

TI  - Increased prefrontal cerebral blood flow in first-episode schizophrenia following
      treatment: longitudinal positron emission tomography study.
PG  - 129-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cognitive deficits, particularly those related to executive function
      and behavioural control, are a core feature of patients with schizophrenia and
      implicate disturbances of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Consistent with this,
      functional imaging studies have identified abnormalities of PFC activity in
      chronically affected patients. The objective of the current study was to
      investigate executive-control related neural activity from first onset of the
      illness through to symptom stabilization. METHOD: The authors examined eight
      neuroleptic-naive first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients within 3 days of first
      presentation and eight healthy age- premorbid-IQ, and gender-matched controls
      (CTL). All FEP patients were later confirmed with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
      Subjects underwent H2-15O positron emission tomography (PET) while performing the
      Stroop interference task that has previously been shown to engage the PFC in
      healthy samples. In a double-blind paradigm, FEP patients were randomly treated
      with either haloperidol or risperidone for 8 weeks, after which CTLs and all but 
      one of the FEP patients were re-scanned. RESULTS: Behaviorally, there was no
      change in task performance from baseline to follow up for either the FEPs or
      CTLs. However, there were significant changes in functional activation in both
      groups across the same period. For CTLs, task-performance was associated with
      greater recruitment of posterior brain regions at follow up compared to baseline,
      while for FEP this involved greater recruitment frontal regions. Concurrently,
      FEP also showed significant improvement in positive symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings suggest that disturbances of the PFC often seen in FEP may be, at 
      least partially, associated with acute symptom expression. However, it is still
      unclear whether this increase in frontal activity is due to symptom stabilization
      per se, the effects of medication, a lack of neurophysiological 'learning' with
      experience/practice, or a combination of these factors. In the context of the
      CTLs performance, we interpret the patient findings as reflective of greater
      neurophysiological effort required for task accomplishment relative to the
      learned, more automated, processing apparent in the CTLs.

TI  - Proteomic analysis of rat prefrontal cortex in three phases of morphine-induced
      conditioned place preference.
PG  - 2239-47
AB  - Morphological alterations of synapse are found after morphine administration,
      suggesting that regulation of synaptic plasticity may be one of the mechanisms of
      neuroadaptation in addiction. However, the molecular basis underlying the
      abnormal synapse morphological and physiological changes in the morphine-induced 
      dependence, withdraw, and relapse is not well understood. As prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) is one of the most important brain regions, which provides executive
      control over drug use and is severely impaired in many addicts, systematic
      analysis of the biochemical and molecular alteration of synaptic fraction of PFC 
      in morphine-induced neuroadaptation is necessary. In this study, differential
      protein expression profiling of synaptic fraction of rat PFC based on
      morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) model was performed with
      two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Our results showed that a total of 80
      proteins were differentially expressed by 2-DE analysis during three phases of
      CPP assay. Of them, 58 were further identified by mass spectrometry. These
      proteins were classified into multiple categories, such as energy metabolism,
      signal transduction, synaptic transmission, cytoskeletal proteins, chaperones,
      and local synaptic protein synthetic machinery according to their biological
      functions. Our study provides a global view of synaptic-related molecular
      networking in PFC under morphine-induced dependence, withdraw, and relapse,
      indicative of a concerted biological process in neuroadaptation under chronic
      morphine exposure.

TI  - Towards an executive without a homunculus: computational models of the prefrontal
      cortex/basal ganglia system.
PG  - 1601-13
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been thought to serve as an 'executive' that
      controls the selection of actions and cognitive functions more generally.
      However, the mechanistic basis of this executive function has not been clearly
      specified often amounting to a homunculus. This paper reviews recent attempts to 
      deconstruct this homunculus by elucidating the precise computational and neural
      mechanisms underlying the executive functions of the PFC. The overall approach
      builds upon existing mechanistic models of the basal ganglia (BG) and frontal
      systems known to play a critical role in motor control and action selection,
      where the BG provide a 'Go' versus 'NoGo' modulation of frontal action
      representations. In our model, the BG modulate working memory representations in 
      prefrontal areas to support more abstract executive functions. We have developed 
      a computational model of this system that is capable of developing human-like
      performance on working memory and executive control tasks through trial-and-error
      learning. This learning is based on reinforcement learning mechanisms associated 
      with the midbrain dopaminergic system and its activation via the BG and amygdala.
      Finally, we briefly describe various empirical tests of this framework.

TI  - Refreshing: a minimal executive function.
PG  - 135-45
AB  - Executive functions include processes by which important information (e.g.,
      words, objects, task goals, contextual information) generated via perception or
      thought can be foregrounded and thereby influence current and subsequent
      processing. One simple executive process that has the effect of foregrounding
      information is refreshing--thinking briefly of a just-activated representation.
      Previous studies (e.g., Johnson et al., 2005) identified refresh-related activity
      in several areas of left prefrontal cortex (PFC). To further specify the
      respective functions of these PFC areas in refreshing, in Experiment 1, healthy
      young adult participants were randomly cued to think of a just previously seen
      word (refresh) or cued to press a button (act). Compared to simply reading a
      word, refresh and act conditions resulted in similar levels of activity in left
      lateral anterior PFC but only refreshing resulted in greater activity in left
      dorsolateral PFC. In Experiment 2, refreshing was contrasted with a minimal
      phonological rehearsal condition. Refreshing was associated with activity in left
      dorsolateral PFC and rehearsing with activity in left ventrolateral PFC. In both 
      experiments, correlations of activity among brain areas suggest different
      functional connectivity for these processes. Together, these findings provide
      evidence that (1) left lateral anterior PFC is associated with initiating a
      non-automatic process, (2) left dorsolateral PFC is associated with foregrounding
      a specific mental representation, and (3) refreshing and rehearsing are neurally 
      distinguishable processes.

AB  - The current study addressed when in the course of stimulus processing, and in
      what brain areas, activity occurs that supports the interpretation of cues that
      signal the appropriateness of different and competing behaviors. Twelve subjects 
      completed interleaved no-go-, pro-, and antitrials, whereas 64-channel
      electroencephalography was recorded. Principle component and distributed source
      analyses were used to evaluate the spatial distribution and time course of
      cortical activity supporting cue evaluation and response selection. By 158 ms
      poststimulus, visual cortex activity was lower for no-go trials than it was for
      both pro- and antitrials, consistent with an early sensory filter on the no-go
      cue. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity at 158 ms was highest during antitrials,
      consistent with this brain region's putative involvement in executive control. At
      204 ms poststimulus, however, PFC activity was the same for pro- and antitrials, 
      consistent with an ostensible role in response selection. PFC activity at 204 ms 
      also was robustly inversely correlated (r = -0.75) with visual cortex activity on
      antitrials, perhaps indicating top-down modulation of early sensory processing
      that would decrease the probability of an error response. These data highlight
      how a distributed neural architecture supports the evaluation of stimuli and
      response choices.

TI  - COMT val108/158met genotype, cognitive function, and cognitive improvement with
      clozapine in schizophrenia.
PG  - 86-96
AB  - Preliminary evidence suggests that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), the
      val108/158met SNP, within the gene that codes for catechol-O-methyltransferase
      (COMT), a key enzyme involved in regulating dopamine (DA) transmission within the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), is related to cognitive function in schizophrenia and
      cognitive improvement with atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs). Specifically,
      several studies have identified an association between working memory and
      executive functions, and COMT val108/158met genotype in schizophrenia; although
      there have been several negative findings that are likely related to small sample
      sizes and, possibly, medication status of patients at the time of testing. The
      association between COMT val108/158met genotype, cognitive function, and
      cognitive improvement with clozapine was investigated in a relatively large
      prospective sample of patients with schizophrenia, most of whom were unmedicated 
      at baseline. Patients were genotyped for the COMT val108/158met SNP after
      completing a cognitive battery consisting of tests of attention, working memory, 
      verbal learning and memory, executive function, and verbal fluency at baseline
      and after 6 weeks and 6 months of treatment with clozapine. Consistent with
      several previous studies, an association between COMT genotype and tests of
      executive function and working memory was identified at baseline. In addition, a 
      novel interaction between genotype and improvement on tests of attention and
      verbal fluency was identified. Specifically, met homozygous and val/met
      heterozygous patients demonstrated significantly greater improvement than val
      homozygous patients following 6 months of treatment with clozapine. The results
      are discussed in relation to previous cross-sectional studies and prospective
      investigations of the associations between COMT genotype, cognition, and
      cognitive improvement with atypical APDs in schizophrenia.

TI  - Directional signals in the prefrontal cortex and in area MT during a working
      memory for visual motion task.
PG  - 11726-42
AB  - Neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) have been implicated in the
      perception of visual motion, whereas prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons have been
      linked to temporary storage of sensory signals, attentional and executive control
      of behavior. Using a task that placed demands on both sets of neurons, we
      investigated their contribution to working memory for visual motion. Monkeys
      compared the direction of two moving random-dot stimuli, sample and test,
      separated by a brief memory delay. Neurons in both areas showed robust
      direction-selective activity during all phases of the task. During the sample,
      approximately 60% of task-related PFC neurons were direction selective, and this 
      selectivity emerged 40 ms later than in MT. Unlike MT, the PFC responses to
      sample did not correlate with behavioral choices, but their selectivity was
      modulated by task demands and diminished on error trials. Reliable directional
      signals were found in both areas during the memory delay, but these signals were 
      transient rather than sustained by neurons of either area. Responses to the test 
      in both areas were modulated by the remembered sample direction, decreasing when 
      the test direction matched the sample. This decrease arose in the PFC 100 ms
      later than in MT and was predictive of the forthcoming decision. Our data suggest
      that neurons in the two regions are functionally connected and make unique
      contributions to different task components. PFC neurons reflect task-related
      information about visual motion and represent decisions that may be based, in
      part, on the comparison in MT between the remembered sample and test.

TI  - Prefrontal cortex dysfunction in patients with suicidal behavior.
PG  - 411-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission has long been demonstrated in
      suicidal behavior. The dorsal and median raphe nuclei housing the main
      serotonergic cell bodies and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly the
      ventral part innervated by the serotonergic system, have therefore been studied
      extensively in suicidal behavior research. However, only a few studies have
      described neuropsychological function impairment in suicidal patients. We
      investigated PFC-related neuropsychological function in patients with suicidal
      behavior, separating dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC)- and orbitofrontal cortex
      (OFC)-related functions. METHOD: We compared 30 euthymic patients with suicidal
      behavior aged 18-65 years with 39 control subjects, for the following
      neuropsychological domains: global intellectual functioning, reward sensitivity, 
      initiation, inhibition, and working memory. Patients and controls were compared
      by means of univariate and multivariate analyses, adjusting for age at interview,
      level of education and mood state at the time of evaluation. Trait impulsivity,
      measured with the Barratt Impulsivity Scale version 10 (BIS-10), was also
      included as a covariate in a subset of analyses. RESULTS: Multivariate
      comparisons demonstrated significant executive function deficits in patients with
      suicidal behavior. In particular, we observed impairment in visuospatial
      conceptualization (p<0.0001), spatial working memory (p=0.001), inhibition
      (Hayling B-A, p=0.04; go anticipations, p=0.01) and visual attention (or reading 
      fluency) (p=0.002). Similar results were obtained following adjustment for motor 
      impulsivity as a covariate, except for spatial working memory. CONCLUSIONS: These
      deficits are consistent with prefrontal dysfunction in patients with suicidal
      behavior. Differentiation between DLPFC- and OFC-related neuropsychological
      functions showed no specific dysfunction of the orbitofrontal region in patients 
      with suicidal behavior in our sample.

TI  - Neural correlates of cognitive efficiency.
PG  - 969-79
AB  - Since its inception, experimental psychology has sought to account for individual
      differences in human performance. Some neuroimaging research, involving complex
      behavioral paradigms, has suggested that faster-performing individuals show
      greater neural activity than slower performers. Other research has suggested that
      faster-performing individuals show less neural activity than slower performers.
      To examine the neural basis of individual performance differences, we had
      participants perform a simple speeded-processing task during fMRI scanning. In
      some prefrontal cortical (PFC) brain regions, faster performers showed less
      cortical activity than slower performers while in other PFC and parietal regions 
      they showed greater activity. Regional-causality analysis indicated that PFC
      exerted more influence over other brain regions for slower than for faster
      individuals. These results suggest that a critical determinant of individual
      performance differences is the efficiency of interactions between brain regions
      and that slower individuals may require more prefrontal executive control than
      faster individuals to perform successfully.

TI  - Executive dysfunction in substance dependent individuals during drug use and
      abstinence: an examination of the behavioral, cognitive and emotional correlates 
      of addiction.
PG  - 405-15
AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that substance-dependent individuals (SDI) are
      impaired in executive control tasks relying on different systems within the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). Three different functional systems have been described: 
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and
      anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) circuits. Dysfunction within each PFC system is
      associated with different behavioral, cognitive, and emotional abnormalities. Few
      studies have conducted an exhaustive examination of all these different factors
      in SDI. In this study, SDI (including alcohol, cocaine, and methamphetamine
      polysubstance users, n=35) were compared with healthy controls (n=36) on a series
      of behavioral (Frontal Systems Behaviour Scale, FrSBe), cognitive (N-back, Go-No 
      Go, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Tasks), and emotional (International Affective
      Picture System, IAPS) tasks, each of which was thought to tax a different
      component of these PFC functional systems. SDI showed greater behavioral problems
      in the apathy, disinhibition, and executive dysfunction subscales of the FrSBe.
      Behavioral deficits were significantly associated with several real-life domains 
      in which SDI typically have problems. SDI also showed poorer performance on
      cognitive tests of working memory, response inhibition and mental flexibility,
      and abnormal processing of affective images from the IAPS. Cognitive, behavioral,
      and emotional measures were moderately correlated.

TI  - The effects of catechol O-methyltransferase genotype on brain activation elicited
      by affective stimuli and cognitive tasks.
PG  - 359-67
AB  - Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) degrades the catecholamine neurotransmitters 
      dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. A functional polymorphism in the COMT 
      gene (val158 met) accounts for a four-fold variation in enzyme activity. The low 
      activity met158 allele has been associated with improved working memory,
      executive functioning, and attentional control, but also with a higher risk of
      anxiety-related behaviors. In spite of the strong effect of the COMT genotype on 
      enzyme activity, its effects on behavior are moderate, accounting for only 4% of 
      variance in task performance. Studies of individuals with intermediate phenotypes
      during activities such as task-dependent brain activation, may more sensitively
      detect gene effects on the brain. A series of studies using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) assessed the effects of the COMT val158 met genotype on 
      central processing during working memory, attentional control, and emotional
      tasks. fMRI revealed a more focused response in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of
      met158 allele carriers during a working memory task. A comparable effect during
      the performance of an attentional control task in the cingulate cortex was also
      observed. These data indicate that met158 allele load is associated with improved
      processing efficiency in the PFC and cingulate, which might be due to lower
      prefrontal dopamine (DA) metabolism, higher DA concentrations, and an increased
      neuronal signal-to-noise ratio during information processing. During performance 
      of an emotional task, reactivity to unpleasant visual stimuli was positively
      correlated with the number of met158 alleles in the amygdala, as well as in other
      limbic and paralimbic nodes. This increased limbic reactivity to unpleasant
      stimuli might be the underlying cause of the lower emotional resilience against
      negative mood states observed in individuals with a higher met158 allele load.
      Thus the met158 allele seems to be beneficial during the performance of working
      memory and attention-related tasks, whereas the val158 allele appears to be
      advantageous during the processing of aversive emotional stimuli.

TI  - Effects of treatment with leuprolide acetate depot on working memory and

PG  - 935-47
AB  - The goal of this study was to assess the influence of sex steroid hormone
      suppression on performance on tests of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and working memory
      function (WM) in premenopausal women. Twenty-five women were treated with
      leuprolide acetate depot (LAD), a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog
      that chemically suppressed ovarian function as treatment of various benign
      gynecologic disorders. Performance on tests of PFC and WM of the LAD-treated
      women was assessed at pretreatment baseline and, again, following 4 weeks of
      treatment and their performance was compared to that of 25 healthy, control
      participants matched on age, education, and general intelligence. Following 4
      weeks of LAD treatment, estrogen levels decreased to the postmenopausal range
      whereas progesterone levels fell to the lower limit of the menstrual cycle range 
      of values. Furthermore, the LAD-treated women also experienced a significant
      deterioration in mood, in health-related symptoms and in performance on two tests
      of WM following 4 weeks of treatment. It was determined that only the
      post-treatment declines in estrogen, but not those in progesterone, in mood, or
      in health-related symptoms were associated with the worsening of performance on
      the WM tests. These findings provide new evidence that estrogen is influential in
      the maintenance of WM processes in premenopausal women.

TI  - The neural basis of interindividual variability in inhibitory efficiency after
      sleep deprivation.
PG  - 7156-62
AB  - Sleep deprivation results in the loss of our ability to suppress a prepotent
      response. The extent of decline in this executive function varies across
      individuals. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the
      neural correlates of sleep deprivation-induced differences in inhibitory
      efficiency. Participants performed a go/no-go task after normal sleep and after
      24 h of total sleep deprivation. Regardless of the extent of change in inhibitory
      efficiency, sleep deprivation lowered go/no-go sustained, task-related activation
      of the ventral and anterior prefrontal (PFC) regions bilaterally. However,
      individuals better able to maintain inhibitory efficiency after sleep deprivation
      could be distinguished by lower stop-related, phasic activation of the right
      ventral PFC during rested wakefulness. These persons also showed a larger rise in
      such activation both here and in the right insula after sleep deprivation
      relative to those whose inhibitory efficiency declined.

TI  - No differences in performance on test of working memory and executive functioning
      between healthy elderly postmenopausal women using or not using hormone therapy.
PG  - 181-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: On average, ovarian function ceases at the age of 52 years so that
      estrogen (E) levels are chronically low following the menopause. Numerous studies
      have found that hormone therapy (HT) helps to protect verbal memory, a
      hippocampal function. Estrogen receptors are also found in the prefrontal cortex 
      (PFC), suggesting that estrogen may modulate executive and working memory
      functions, both mediated by the PFC. The possible role of progesterone (P) on
      executive functions and working memory is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine the
      relationship between neuropsychological performance, age of initiation of HT, and
      duration of HT use. METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, the neuropsychological
      performance of 37 postmenopausal women (mean age, 65 years) who used either
      estrogen-only or sequential E + P (E-alone group)(n = 22) or E + P continuously
      (n = 15) was compared to that of 28 healthy postmenopausal women matched for age 
      and education who had never used HT. It was hypothesized that the E-only users
      would perform better then the E + P and the never-users on neuropsychological
      tests of verbal memory, executive function and working memory. RESULTS: Results
      showed only minor between-group differences on working memory scores such that
      the E + P users were slowest to generate a response on the N-Back test of working
      memory. No group differences on tests of executive functions were found.
      CONCLUSION: There was no relationship between neuropsychological performance, age
      of initiation of HT, or duration of HT use.

TI  - Lack of influence of COMT and NET genes variants on executive functions in
      schizophrenic and bipolar patients, their first-degree relatives and controls.
PG  - 504-12
AB  - Abnormal dopaminergic function in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may be a key factor
      in the etiopathogeny of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Both schizophrenic
      and bipolar subjects have executive functions (EF) deficits, thought to reflect
      abnormal PFC function. The main inactivation pathways for dopamine in the PFC are
      enzymatic cleavage by the Carboxy-O-Methyl-Transferase (COMT) and reuptake by the
      nor-epinephrine transporter (NET). Our aim in this study was to replicate
      previous studies that investigated influence of the COMT genotype on EF in
      schizophrenic subjects, their relatives and controls and extend their scope by
      including bipolar patients, and their relatives and by exploring NET gene
      polymorphisms influence on executive performances. We investigated one functional
      polymorphism of the COMT gene and two polymorphisms of the NET gene. EF were
      assessed by means of the Trail Making Test (TMT) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting
      Test (WCST). We assessed the effect of each of the three genotypes on EF for the 
      whole sample (N = 318) and separately in schizophrenic (N = 66), bipolar (N = 94)
      and healthy subjects (i.e., relatives and controls N = 158). Separate analyses
      were performed because of the presence, in patients samples, of potentially
      confounding factors, especially medication. Genotype had no significant effect on
      the cognitive measures in any of the analyses (for the two EF measures, the three
      polymorphisms, and the four groups). In our sample we found no evidence in favor 
      of a major effect of COMT or NET polymorphisms on the two tests of EF.

TI  - Mesocortical dopamine modulation of executive functions: beyond working memory.
PG  - 567-85
AB  - RATIONALE: Dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is
      known to play an essential role in mediating executive functions such as the
      working memory. DA exerts these effects by acting on D1 receptors because
      blockade or stimulation of these receptors in the PFC can impair performance on
      delayed response tasks. However, comparatively less is known about dopaminergic
      mechanisms that mediate other executive functions regulated by the PFC.
      Furthermore, the functional importance of other DA receptor subtypes that reside 
      on PFC neurons (D2 and D4) is unclear. OBJECTIVES: This review will summarize
      previous findings and previously unpublished data addressing the contribution of 
      PFC DA to higher-order cognition. We will compare the DA receptor mechanisms,
      which regulate executive functions such as working memory, behavioral
      flexibility, and decision-making. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Whereas PFC D1
      receptor activity is of primary importance in working memory, D1 and D2 receptors
      act in a cooperative manner to facilitate behavioral flexibility. We note that
      the principle of the "inverted U-shaped" function of D1 receptor activity
      mediating working memory does not necessarily apply to other PFC functions. DA in
      different subregions of the PFC also mediates decision-making assessed with delay
      discounting or effort-based procedures, and we report that D1, D2, and D4
      receptors in the medial PFC contribute to decision-making when animals must bias 
      the direction of behavior to avoid aversive stimuli, assessed with a conditioned 
      punishment procedure. Thus, mesocortical DA modulation of distinct executive
      functions is subserved by dissociable profiles of DA receptor activity in the
      PFC.

TI  - Is there evidence for neural compensation in attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder? A review of the functional neuroimaging literature.
PG  - 445-65
AB  - This article reviews evidence for the presence of a compensatory, alternative,
      neural system and its possible link to associated processing strategies in
      children and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The
      article presents findings on a region by region basis that suggests ADHD should
      be characterized not only by neural hypo-activity, as it is commonly thought but 
      neural hyperactivity as well, in regions of the brain that may relate to
      compensatory brain and behavioral functioning. In this context studies from the
      functional neuroimaging literature are reviewed. We hypothesize that impaired
      prefrontal (PFC) and anterior cingulate (ACC) cortex function in ADHD reduces the
      ability to optimally recruit subsidiary brain regions and strategies to perform
      cognitive tasks. The authors conclude that healthy individuals can recruit brain 
      regions using visual, spatial or verbal rehearsal for tasks as needed. In
      contrast, individuals with ADHD may be less able to engage higher order executive
      systems to flexibly recruit brain regions to match given task demands. This may
      result in greater reliance on neuroanatomy that is associated with visual,
      spatial, and motoric processing rather than verbal strategies. The authors
      speculate that this impaired flexibility in recruiting brain regions and
      associated strategies limits adaptation to new cognitive demands as they present 
      and may require more effortful processing.

TI  - Catechol-o-methyltransferase, cognition, and psychosis: Val158Met and beyond.
PG  - 141-51
AB  - This review summarizes our current understanding of catechol-o-methyltransferase 
      (COMT) and how it relates to brain function and schizophrenia. We begin by
      considering the COMT gene, its transcripts and proteins, and its relevance for
      central catecholamine function. We then describe how variation in COMT activity
      affects the function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and associated areas,
      reviewing evidence that COMT modulates executive function and working memory and 
      highlighting recent data that also implicate it in emotional processing. Finally,
      we discuss briefly the genetic association between COMT and schizophrenia,
      focusing in particular on the complex interaction of functional loci within the
      gene that may underlie the mixed results of studies to date. We conclude by
      outlining preliminary data indicating that COMT is a promising therapeutic target
      for ameliorating the cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia.

TI  - Interhemispheric connectivity and executive functioning in adults with Tourette
      syndrome.
PG  - 66-76
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is relatively smaller, and the corpus callosum (CC)
      larger, in adults with Tourette syndrome (TS). The authors explored the possible 
      roles of the PFC and the CC in mediating interhemispheric interference and
      coordination in TS adults. They measured performance on M. Kinsbourne and J.
      Cook's (1971) verbal-manual interference task and on the bimanual Purdue Pegboard
      in 38 adults with TS and 34 healthy adults. Compared with controls, TS subjects
      were impaired on the bimanual Purdue Pegboard. On the dual task, right-hand
      performance did not differ between groups, but the normally expected left-hand
      advantage (opposite hemisphere condition) was absent in TS subjects. In the
      control group only, better left-hand performance accompanied larger PFC volumes
      but not CC cross-sectional area. PFC dysfunction might have precluded executive
      control of interference in the TS group.

TI  - Isolating rule- versus evidence-based prefrontal activity during episodic and
      lexical discrimination: a functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation of 
      detection theory distinctions.
PG  - 1614-22
AB  - Dorsolateral and frontopolar prefrontal cortices (PFCs) are often implicated in
      neuroimaging studies of memory retrieval, with this activity ascribed to
      controlled monitoring processes indicative of difficult or demanding retrieval.
      Difficulty, however, is multiply determined, with success rates governed both by 
      the available evidence and by the nature of decision rules applied to that
      evidence. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we isolated 
      these factors by 1) contrasting different decision rules across matched evidence 
      and 2) manipulating the level of evidence within a fixed decision rule. For
      identically constructed retrieval probes (1 old and 1 new item), same-different
      (are these different?) compared with forced-choice (which one is old?) decision
      rules yielded bilateral dorsolateral and right frontopolar PFC increases.
      However, these regions were unaffected when the available evidence was greatly
      lowered within forced-choice decisions. Thus, the regions were simultaneously
      sensitive to the type of decision rule and yet insensitive to the level of
      evidence supporting those decisions. Analogous lexical tasks yielded similar
      patterns, demonstrating that the PFC responses were not episodic memory specific.
      We discuss the mechanistic differences between same-different versus
      forced-choice decisions and the implications of these data for current theories
      of PFC activity during episodic remembering and executive control.

TI  - Differential impact of severity of drug use on frontal behavioral symptoms.
PG  - 1373-82
AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that substance abusers are impaired in
      cognitive-executive control tasks relying on different functional systems
      converging in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Different PFC functional systems
      relevant to addiction have been described: the dorsolateral (DLC), orbitofrontal 
      (OFC), and anterior cingulate (ACC) circuits. Each system is associated with
      different behavioral, cognitive, and emotional deficits, including apathy,
      disinhibition, and executive dysfunction. In this study, we examined the effects 
      of severity of use of different drugs on apathy, disinhibition and executive
      dysfunction behavioral deficits as measured by the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale
      (FrSBe). The FrSBe, and a severity of substance use interview were administered
      to 32 poly-substance abusers. Multiple regression analyses showed that severity
      of cannabis use significantly predicted greater apathy and executive dysfunction 
      behavior; and that severity of cocaine use significantly predicted greater
      disinhibition behavior. These results are consistent with previous studies using 
      cognitive measures and support the notion that severity of substance use
      significantly affects behavioral symptoms associated with PFC systems
      functioning. These clinical symptoms should be specifically addressed during
      rehabilitation.

TI  - Delay-period activity in the prefrontal cortex: one function is sensory gating.
PG  - 1679-90
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) contributes to working memory functions via executive
      control processes that do not entail the storage, per se, of mnemonic
      representations. One of these control processes may be a sensory gating mechanism
      that facilitates retention of representations in working memory by
      down-regulating the gain of the sensory processing of intervening irrelevant
      stimuli. This idea was tested by scanning healthy young adults with functional
      magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a delayed face-recognition task. 
      The 2 x 2 factorial design varied the factors of Memory (present, absent) and
      Distraction (present, absent). During memory-present trials, target and probe
      stimuli were individual gray-scale male faces. Memory-absent trials were
      identical, except that they employed the same recurring female faces (denoting a 
      "no memory" trial). Distraction-present trials featured rapid serial visual
      presentation of bespectacled male faces during the two middle seconds of the
      delay. The first step of the analyses identified dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) and
      inferior occipitotemporal cortex (IOTC) voxels exhibiting delay-period activity
      in memory-present/distraction-absent trials, that is, the "unfilled" delay.
      Within these voxels, distraction-evoked activity in the dlPFC was markedly higher
      during trials that required the concurrent short-term retention of information
      than on those that did not, whereas the opposite effect was seen in the IOTC.
      These results are consistent with the view that processes related to sensory
      gating account for a portion of the delay-period activity that is routinely
      observed in the dlPFC.

TI  - Cognitive deficits associated with restless legs syndrome (RLS).
PG  - 25-30
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Restless legs syndrome produces significant chronic sleep
      loss, which despite not causing expected profound sleepiness, might nonetheless
      produce cognitive deficits similar to those seen with acute sleep deprivation,
      i.e. involving mostly pre-frontal cortical (PFC) functioning. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Sixteen patients off RLS treatment for at least 2 weeks and 15 age- and 
      gender-matched control subjects had polysomnograms (PSGs) on two consecutive
      nights. Cognitive tests were given in the morning after the second night. Six
      cognitive tests were used: two Verbal Fluency tests and the Trail Making tests
      were selected to be particularly sensitive to PFC function and sleep loss.
      Porteus Mazes and the Stroop Test were selected to reflect more general frontal
      and executive function. The Colored Progressive Matrices were used to assess
      general cognitive skills. RESULTS: RLS patients compared to controls showed
      significant (P<0.05) and sizeable (20-40%) deficits on two of the three PFC tests
      and marginally non-significant deficit (P<0.1) on the third. The other three
      tests showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that
      RLS patients show cognitive deficits similar to that reported for one night of
      sleep loss.

TI  - Evidence for sustained attention and working memory in schizophrenia sharing a
      common mechanism.
PG  - 391-8
AB  - Sustained attention and working memory (WM) are closely related functions that
      may share common mechanisms. The authors assessed sustained attention in
      schizophrenia patients and healthy comparison subjects using visuomotor tracking 
      tasks under varying distractor loads. The attentional effort expended to deal
      with distractors was lower in patients and showed significant association with
      WM, executive function and negative symptoms in that group. It is proposed that
      the anterior attention system of sustained attention models and the executive
      function of the WM model describe the same or a closely related mechanism that is
      located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and is impaired in schizophrenia.

TI  - Intact hemispheric specialization for spatial and shape working memory in
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using functional MRI, we investigated whether, like healthy subjects, 
      patients with schizophrenia show a relative hemispheric specialization in
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) for spatial and shape working memory (WM). 
      We hypothesized that reduced specialization in schizophrenia would reflect a
      failure to adopt optimal domain-specific strategies and would contribute to WM
      deficits. METHODS: Twelve healthy subjects and 16 schizophrenia patients
      performed spatial and shape WM tasks and a non-WM control task. Direct
      comparisons of the spatial and shape WM tasks assessed specialization. RESULTS:
      Despite deficient WM performance, both patients and controls showed a relative
      hemispheric specialization in ventrolateral PFC for spatial (right) and shape
      (left) WM and did not differ in this regard. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of intact
      hemispheric specialization in ventrolateral PFC suggests that patients employ the
      same domain-specific strategies as healthy subjects during spatial and shape WM. 
      Rather than reflecting a failure to adopt the optimal strategy, we hypothesize
      that WM deficits in schizophrenia reflect impairments of executive processes that
      are required for WM performance regardless of domain. These processes are
      associated with activity in the dorsolateral PFC, a region that has been
      repeatedly implicated in studies of WM.

TI  - Dissociating prefrontal contributions during a recency memory task.
PG  - 350-64
AB  - Neuroimaging studies of normal young adults have consistently found right
      prefrontal cortex (RPFC) activity during the performance of recency memory tasks.
      However, it is unclear whether the involvement of RPFC during these tasks
      reflects retrieval processes or executive processes such as: strategic ordering
      or monitoring. In the current study, we distinguish between those PFC regions
      that are more related to retrieval processes, versus strategic ordering
      processes. An event-related fMRI study was conducted in which eight young
      subjects were scanned while performing verbal episodic retrieval tasks
      (recognition and recency memory tasks), and verbal non-memory strategic
      organizing control tasks (reverse alphabetizing of words). The fMRI results show 
      that young subjects engaged right dorsolateral PFC during recency and reverse
      alphabetizing control tasks. Left ventral PFC was engaged across all tasks;
      however, a subset of voxels within this region was more active during retrieval
      tasks. Left dorsolateral and right ventral PFC activity was more related to the
      performance of reverse alphabetizing tasks, respectively. We conclude that right 
      dorsolateral PFC activity during recency memory reflects more general strategic
      organizational or monitoring processes, and is not EM-specific.

TI  - The Maudsley Bipolar Disorder Project.
PG  - 19-25
AB  - PURPOSE: The Maudsley Bipolar Disorder Project set out to investigate the
      cognitive and brain structural and functional characteristics of Bipolar Disorder
      I (BDI). METHODS: Participating patients were recruited while in remission from a
      secondary care setting and were matched to healthy volunteers in terms of age,
      gender, race, and years of education. All participants underwent extensive
      clinical and cognitive assessment. Brain structural and functional data also were
      obtained by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: Compared with
      controls, patients showed subtle widespread decrements, with executive function
      being more markedly impaired. Patients also showed volume decrements in the
      ventral prefrontal cortex (VPFC) bilaterally and the dorsal PFC (DPFC) on the
      left, whereas the volume of the amygdala was bilaterally enlarged. Patients
      showed subtle abnormalities in functional MRI in their DPFC, with marked
      decrements in activity in both the DPFC and VPFC in tasks that rely on the
      functional interaction of these brain regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest
      that BDI is associated with trait deficits in executive function and in the
      structure and function of the PFC.

TI  - Methylphenidate improves prefrontal cortical cognitive function through alpha2
      adrenoceptor and dopamine D1 receptor actions: Relevance to therapeutic effects
      in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
PG  - 2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methylphenidate (MPH) is the classic treatment for Attention Deficit 
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic
      actions remain unclear. Recent studies have identified an oral, MPH dose regimen 
      which when given to rats produces drug plasma levels similar to those measured in
      humans. The current study examined the effects of these low, orally-administered 
      doses of MPH in rats performing a delayed alternation task dependent on
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region that is dysfunctional in ADHD, and is
      highly sensitive to levels of catecholamines. The receptor mechanisms underlying 
      the enhancing effects of MPH were explored by challenging the MPH response with
      the noradrenergic alpha2 adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan, and the dopamine D1
      antagonist, SCH23390. RESULTS: MPH produced an inverted U dose response whereby
      moderate doses (1.0-2.0 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly improved delayed alternation
      performance, while higher doses (2.0-3.0 mg/kg, p.o.) produced perseverative
      errors in many animals. The enhancing effects of MPH were blocked by
      co-administration of either the alpha2 adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan, or the 
      dopamine D1 antagonist, SCH23390, in doses that had no effect on their own.
      CONCLUSION: The administration of low, oral doses of MPH to rats has effects on
      PFC cognitive function similar to those seen in humans and patients with ADHD.
      The rat can thus be used as a model for examination of neural mechanisms
      underlying the therapeutic effects of MPH on executive functions in humans. The
      efficacy of idazoxan and SCH23390 in reversing the beneficial effects of MPH
      indicate that both noradrenergic alpha2 adrenoceptor and dopamine D1 receptor
      stimulation contribute to cognitive-enhancing effects of MPH.

TI  - Prefrontal cortex and the mediation of proactive interference in working memory.
PG  - 600-8
AB  - Mediating proactive interference (PI), the deleterious effect of antecedent
      information on current memory representations, is believed to be a key function
      of prefrontal cortex (PFC). Item-specific PI results when an invalid probe
      matches a memorandum from the preceding trial; item-nonspecific PI is produced by
      the accumulation of no-longer-relevant items from previous trials. We tested the 
      hypothesis that these two types of PI are mediated by common PFC-based processes 
      with an fMRI study of a delayed-recognition task designed to produce both types
      of PI. Our results indicated that the fMRI correlates of both effects were
      restricted both to Brodmann's area 45 in the left hemisphere and to the memory
      probe epoch of the trial. These results suggest that a unification of the
      literatures and approaches that have independently studied these phenomena might 
      offer a fruitful new perspective from which to study the relations between
      working memory, executive control, and the PFC.

TI  - Bursting of prefrontal cortex neurons in awake rats is regulated by metabotropic 
      glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptors: rate-dependent influence and interaction with NMDA
      receptors.
PG  - 93-105
AB  - Metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptors have been recently implicated in
      prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent executive functions because inhibition of mGlu5
      receptors impairs working memory and worsens cognitive-impairing effects of NMDA 
      receptor antagonists. To better understand the mechanisms by which mGlu5
      receptors influence PFC function, we examined the effects of selective mGlu5
      receptor antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), given alone or in
      combination with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801, on ensemble single unit
      activity in the medial PFC (mPFC) of behaving rats. MPEP decreased the
      spontaneous burst activity of the majority of mPFC neurons. This inhibition was
      selective for the most active cells because greater decreases were observed in
      neurons with higher baseline firing rates. MPEP augmented the effects of MK801 on
      burst activity, variability of spike firing and random spike activity. These
      findings demonstrate that in awake animals mGlu5 receptors regulate the function 
      of PFC neurons by two related mechanisms: (i) rate-dependent excitatory influence
      on spontaneous burst activity; and (ii) potentiation of NMDA receptor mediated
      effects on firing rate and burst activity. These mechanisms support the idea that
      modulation of mGlu5 receptors may provide a pharmacological strategy for
      fine-tuning the temporal pattern of firing of PFC neurons.

TI  - Social and emotional decision-making following frontal lobe injury.
PG  - 398-403
AB  - Neuropsychological, psychophysiological and functional imaging research has begun
      to offer insights into the everyday difficulties in decision-making experienced
      by some patients with frontal lobe damage. It is widely accepted that the ventral
      prefrontal cortex plays a pivotal role in social and emotional decision-making.
      This article will review experimental findings using the Iowa Gambling Task and
      the Cambridge Gamble Task that explore the brain mechanisms of decision-making.
      Convergent evidence from the two tasks confirms the importance of ventral PFC,
      but also highlights the relevance of lesion laterality, lesion aetiology, and the
      contribution of other brain regions (including the dorsal prefrontal cortex and
      amygdala) to decision-making abilities. The extent to which disrupted
      decision-making can be separated from the broader domain of executive function is
      discussed.

TI  - Differential dopaminergic modulation of executive control in healthy subjects.
PG  - 420-30
AB  - RATIONALE: Executive control (EC) has different subcomponents, e.g., response
      inhibition (measured, for example, by the Stroop task) and working memory
      (WM-measured, for example, by delayed response tasks, DRT). EC has been
      associated with networks involving the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Moreover, there
      is evidence that dopamine agonists, especially those with a D1 profile, may
      modulate EC, since in the PFC D1 subtype receptors are more abundant. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aimed to selectively distinguish whether D1 versus D2 dopamine agonism
      differentially influences EC related to the inhibition of irrelevant information 
      and WM. Because of its D1 component, we predicted that the administration of
      pergolide (mixed D1/D2 agonist), in comparison with bromocriptine (D2 selective
      agonist) and placebo, would enhance performance in both EC tasks. Using a
      lateralized Stroop task, we predicted a decrease in the interference effect, as
      well as error rates, while no increase in facilitation effects. For the DRT task,
      we predicted fewer error scores in the delay condition. METHODS: Forty male
      healthy subjects participated in this randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover study. RESULTS: For the Stroop task no superiority 
      of pergolide was found; however, with bromocriptine, decreased interference was
      found. No modulation of lateralization effects was shown in interference
      measures. Moreover, subjects on pergolide showed an absence of facilitation
      effects. No effects of either agonist were found for the DRT. CONCLUSION: Our
      findings suggest that dopamine agonists modulate two EC tasks differently.
      Furthermore, there seems to be a selective modulation of different aspects of the
      Stroop task.

TI  - Working memory functioning in schizophrenia patients and their first-degree
      relatives: cognitive functioning shedding light on etiology.
PG  - 930-42
AB  - There is accumulating evidence for involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in 
      the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. A primary function supported by the PFC is 
      working memory (WM). Findings from WM studies in schizophrenia can provide
      insight into the nature of clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits associated
      with this disorder, as well as begin to suggest areas of underlying
      neuropathology. To date, studies have not adequately investigated different WM
      domains (e.g., verbal, spatial, or object) or processing requirements (e.g.,
      maintenance, monitoring, or manipulation), shown to be associated with distinct
      patterns of neural activation, in schizophrenia patients and their well
      relatives. Accordingly, this study evaluated the performance of schizophrenia
      patients, their first-degree biological relatives, and nonpsychiatric controls on
      a comprehensive battery of WM tasks and investigated the association among WM
      deficits and schizophrenia-spectrum psychopathology. The findings indicate that
      schizophrenia patients are consistently impaired on WM tasks, irrespective of WM 
      domain or processing requirements. In contrast, their unaffected relatives are
      only impaired on WM tasks with higher central executive processing requirements. 
      This pattern of WM performance may further implicate DLPFC dysfunction in the
      liability for schizophrenia and has implications for future cognitive, genetic,
      and neurodevelopmental research.

TI  - Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val108/158 Met polymorphism does not modulate
      executive function in children with ADHD.
PG  - 30
AB  - BACKGROUND: An association has been observed between the
      catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, the predominant means of catecholamine 
      catabolism within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and neuropsychological task
      performance in healthy and schizophrenic adults. Since several of the cognitive
      functions typically deficient in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD) are mediated by prefrontal dopamine (DA) mechanisms, we
      investigated the relationship between a functional polymorphism of the COMT gene 
      and neuropsychological task performance in these children. METHODS: The
      Val108/158 Met polymorphism of the COMT gene was genotyped in 118 children with
      ADHD (DSM-IV). The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Tower of London (TOL), and
      Self-Ordered Pointing Task (SOPT) were employed to evaluate executive functions. 
      Neuropsychological task performance was compared across genotype groups using
      analysis of variance. RESULTS: ADHD children with the Val/Val, Val/Met and
      Met/Met genotypes were similar with regard to demographic and clinical
      characteristics. No genotype effects were observed for WCST standardized
      perseverative error scores [F2,97 = 0.67; p > 0.05], TOL standardized scores
      [F2,99 = 0.97; p > 0.05], and SOPT error scores [F2,108 = 0.62; p > 0.05].
      CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the observed association between WCST performance and
      the Val108/158 Met polymorphism of the COMT gene in both healthy and
      schizophrenic adults, this polymorphism does not appear to modulate executive
      functions in children with ADHD.

TI  - Effect of methylphenidate on executive functioning in adults with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: normalization of behavior but not
      related brain activity.
PG  - 597-606
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the effect of prolonged methylphenidate (MPH) treatment
      on the functional neuroanatomy of executive functioning in adult men with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: Positron emission
      tomography with [(15)O] water measured alterations of regional cerebral blood
      flow (rCBF) during the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task and a control task in 
      10 ADHD and 11 normal control men. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder men
      were imaged unmedicated and after a clinically optimal dose of MPH for 3 weeks.
      RESULTS: Methylphenidate improved ADHD task performance, reduced rCBF in the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), and increased rCBF in the right thalamus and precentral 
      gyrus. Comparisons between the ADHD and normal control groups showed that normal 
      control participants exhibited greater anterior cingulate cortex and temporal
      gyrus rCBF than ADHD participants under both conditions. Executive functioning
      was associated with greater subcortical (basal ganglia and cerebellar vermis)
      activation in the ADHD than normal control group under both conditions.
      CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate does not normalize task-related activity in ADHD.
      Task-related rCBF decreases in the PFC may be due to improved filtering out of
      task-irrelevant stimuli by way of MPH-mediated dopamine release in the PFC.

PG  - 132-43
AB  - We used fMRI to study the brain processes involved in the executive control of
      behavior. The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), which allows
      unpredictable and predictable NOGO events to be contrasted, was imaged using a
      mixed (block and event-related) fMRI design to examine tonic and phasic processes
      involved in response inhibition, error detection, conflict monitoring and
      sustained attention. A network of regions, including right ventral prefrontal
      cortex (PFC), left dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and right inferior parietal cortex,
      was activated for successful unpredictable inhibitions, while rostral anterior
      cingulate was implicated in error processing and the pre-SMA in conflict
      monitoring. Furthermore, the pattern of correlations between left dorsolateral
      PFC, implicated in task-set maintenance, and the pre-SMA were indicative of a
      tight coupling between prefrontally mediated control and conflict levels
      monitored more posteriorly. The results reveal that the executive control of
      behavior can be separated into distinct functions performed by discrete cortical 
      regions.

TI  - Normal aging results in decreased synaptic excitation and increased synaptic
      inhibition of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the monkey prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 277-88
AB  - Executive system function, mediated largely by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), often
      declines significantly with normal aging in humans and non-human primates. The
      neural substrates of this decline are unknown, but age-related changes in the
      structural properties of PFC neurons could lead to altered synaptic signaling and
      ultimately to PFC dysfunction. The present study addressed this issue using
      whole-cell patch clamp assessment of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic
      currents (PSCs) in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in in vitro slices of the PFC from
      behaviorally characterized young (< or =12 years old) and aged (> or =19 years
      old) rhesus monkeys. Behaviorally, aged monkeys were significantly impaired in
      performance on memory and executive system function tasks. Physiologically, the
      frequency of spontaneous glutamate receptor-mediated excitatory PSCs was
      significantly reduced in cells from aged monkeys, while the frequency of
      spontaneous GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory PSCs was significantly increased. 
      In contrast, there was no effect of age on the frequency, amplitude, rise time or
      decay time of action potential-independent miniature excitatory and inhibitory
      PSCs. The observed change in excitatory-inhibitory synaptic balance likely leads 
      to significantly altered signaling properties of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the
      PFC with age.

TI  - Inhibition and the right inferior frontal cortex.
PG  - 170-7
AB  - It is controversial whether different cognitive functions can be mapped to
      discrete regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The localisationist tradition
      has associated one cognitive function - inhibition - by turns with dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), inferior frontal cortex (IFC), or orbital frontal
      cortex (OFC). Inhibition is postulated to be a mechanism by which PFC exerts its 
      effects on subcortical and posterior-cortical regions to implement executive
      control. We review evidence concerning inhibition of responses and task-sets.
      Whereas neuroimaging implicates diverse PFC foci, advances in human
      lesion-mapping support the functional localization of such inhibition to right
      IFC alone. Future research should investigate the generality of this proposed
      inhibitory function to other task domains, and its interaction within a wider
      network.

TI  - A preliminary report on dopamine system reactivity in PKU: acute effects of
      haloperidol on neuropsychological, physiological, and neuroendocrine functions.
PG  - 18-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Classic phenylketonuria (PKU) is due to an inborn error of metabolism
      resulting in an inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. To avoid
      mental retardation, affected individuals observe a phenylalanine-restricted diet.
      When dietary control is poor, deficits in prefrontally mediated cognitive
      functions have been observed. It has been suggested that these deficits are due
      to disruptions in the mesocortical dopamine system that projects to the
      prefrontal cortex. METHODS: In this study, dopamine system reactivity was
      examined in individuals with PKU, relative to age-matched controls, using the
      non-specific DA antagonist haloperidol, in a repeated measures placebo-controlled
      design. Outcome variables included neuroendocrine, physiological, and cognitive
      measures. RESULTS: Regardless of drug condition, PKU participants differed from
      control participants in their blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels, and in
      their times to complete measures of attention and working memory. Also, relative 
      to placebo, haloperidol influenced several variables irrespective of group
      status, including serum prolactin secretion, times to complete attention and
      working memory tasks, and accuracy of working memory performance. An interaction 
      between group and drug condition was observed for the digit span task, where PKU 
      participants exhibited greater relative impairments on haloperidol. When
      composite indices of impairment were derived, PKU participants demonstrated
      selective disruption in executive function on haloperidol relative to control
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Findings are consistent with the presence of
      frontostriatal dysfunction in PKU but are less consistent with the notion that
      PFC dopamine function is specifically affected.

TI  - A functional neuroimaging study of motivation and executive function.
PG  - 1045-54
AB  - Executive functions, such as working memory, must intersect with functions that
      determine value for the organism. Functional imaging work in humans and
      single-unit recordings in non-human primates provide evidence that PFC might
      integrate motivational context with working memory. With functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI), we addressed the question of motivation and working
      memory, using a trial-related design in an object-working memory task. The design
      permitted the analysis of BOLD signal at separate stages, corresponding to
      encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. Subjects were motivated by a financial
      incentive during the task, such that they could gain a high or a low reward. The 
      two different levels of reward also entailed greater or lesser risk of losing
      money for incorrect responses. In the high, relative to the low, reward
      condition, subjects shifted response bias, and showed a trend to greater
      sensitivity. We found main effects in fMRI BOLD signal for reward, which
      overlapped with BOLD effects for maintenance of information, in the right
      superior frontal sulcus and bilateral intraparietal sulcus. We also found an
      interaction between reward and retrieval from working memory in the right
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Main effects of load and reward occurred in
      adjacent regions of the ventrolateral PFC during retrieval. The data demonstrate 
      that when subjects perform a simple working memory task, financial incentives
      motivate performance and interact with some of the same neural networks that
      process various stages of working memory. Areas of overlap and interaction may
      integrate information about value, or they may represent a general effect of
      motivation increasing neural effort.

TI  - Cortico-subcortical contributions to executive control.
PG  - 271-89
AB  - The term "executive functions" refers to a range of cognitive processes, their
      common feature being the coordination of information processing and action
      control. Cortico-subcortical circuits which connect the prefrontal cortex (PFC), 
      the basal ganglia and the cerebellum via the thalamus are believed to serve as
      neuroanatomical substrates of executive processing. This paper focuses on
      information processing related to executive functions by the PFC and related
      subcortical regions. Findings are mainly derived from neuropsychological
      investigations of brain-damaged patients but also from imaging studies in healthy
      subjects. There is evidence for subtle differences between these regions with
      respect to the cognitive mechanisms contributing to inhibition of habitual
      responses, task management/multitasking and set shifting, although the data base 
      is sparse so far.

TI  - Prefrontal-cingulate activation during executive control: which comes first?
PG  - 278-87
AB  - The Stroop test requires executive control functions, in particular inhibition of
      a learned routine (in this case, word reading). The spatiotemporal analysis of
      brain activation during Stroop task execution was performed in 16 healthy
      subjects using high-density event-related potentials (ERPs) and dipole source
      modeling (BESA software). Scalp ERP analysis revealed the neurophysiological
      substrate of the interference effect: first, a greater negativity in the
      incongruent as compared to the congruent and neutral conditions was found between
      350 and 450 ms poststimulus over left frontocentral scalp regions. Source
      analysis of the difference wave (incongruent-congruent) indicated that a
      generator localized in left prefrontal cortex (PFC) contributed to this effect.
      Second, immediately after the first effect, a greater positivity in the
      incongruent as compared to the congruent and neutral conditions developed between
      450 and 550 ms poststimulus over midline frontocentral scalp regions. A generator
      of this effect was located in right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). ACC
      activation seems to follow the activation of PFC with some overlap between the
      two components. Possible interpretation of this finding is that PFC signals ACC
      when executive control is required and ACC implements the control.

TI  - The architecture of cognitive control in the human prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 1181-5
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves cognitive control: the ability to
      coordinate thoughts or actions in relation with internal goals. Its functional
      architecture, however, remains poorly understood. Using brain imaging in humans, 
      we showed that the lateral PFC is organized as a cascade of executive processes
      from premotor to anterior PFC regions that control behavior according to stimuli,
      the present perceptual context, and the temporal episode in which stimuli occur, 
      respectively. The results support an unified modular model of cognitive control
      that describes the overall functional organization of the human lateral PFC and
      has basic methodological and theoretical implications.

TI  - A computational model of prefrontal control in free recall: strategic memory use 
      in the California Verbal Learning Task.
PG  - 821-32
AB  - Several decades of research into the function of the frontal lobes in
      brain-damaged patients, and more recently in intact individuals using function
      brain imaging, has delineated the complex executive functions of the frontal
      cortex. And yet, the mechanisms by which the brain achieves these functions
      remain poorly understood. Here, we present a computational model of the role of
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in controlled memory use that may help to shed light 
      on the mechanisms underlying one aspect of frontal control: the development and
      deployment of recall strategies. The model accounts for interactions between the 
      PFC and medial temporal lobe in strategic memory use. The PFC self-organizes its 
      own mnemonic codes using internally derived performance measures. These mnemonic 
      codes serve as retrieval cues by biasing retrieval in the medial temporal lobe
      memory system. We present data from three simulation experiments that demonstrate
      strategic encoding and retrieval in the free recall of categorized lists of
      words. Experiment 1 compares the performance of the model with two control
      networks to evaluate the contribution of various components of the model.
      Experiment 2 compares the performance of normal and frontally lesioned models to 
      data from several studies using frontally intact and frontally lesioned
      individuals, as well as normal, healthy individuals under conditions of divided
      attention. Experiment 3 compares the model's performance on the recall of blocked
      and unblocked categorized lists of words to data from Stuss et al. (1994) for
      individuals with control and frontal lobe lesions. Overall, our model captures a 
      number of aspects of human performance on free recall tasks: an increase in total
      words recalled and in semantic clustering scores across trials, superiority on
      blocked lists of related items compared to unblocked lists of related items, and 
      similar patterns of performance across trials in the normal and frontally
      lesioned models, with poorer overall performance of the lesioned models on all
      measures. The model also has a number of shortcomings, in light of which we
      suggest extensions to the model that would enable more sophisticated forms of
      strategic control.

TI  - Parvalbumin-, calbindin-, and calretinin-immunoreactive neurons in the prefrontal
      cortex of the owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatus): a standardized quantitative
      comparison with sensory and motor areas.
PG  - 19-30
AB  - Recent studies have revealed regional variation in the density and distribution
      of inhibitory neurons in different cortical areas, which are thought to reflect
      area-specific specializations in cortical circuitry. However, there are as yet
      few standardized quantitative data regarding how the inhibitory circuitry in
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is thought to be involved in executive functions
      such as cognition, emotion and decision making, compares to that in other
      cortical areas. Here we used immunohistochemical techniques to determine the
      density and distribution of parvalbumin (PV)-, calbindin (CB)-, and calretinin
      (CR)-immunoreactive (ir) neurons and axon terminals in the dorsolateral and
      orbital PFC of the owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatus), and compared them directly
      with data obtained using the same techniques in 11 different visual,
      somatosensory and motor areas. We found marked differences in the density of
      PV-ir, CB-ir, and CR-ir interneurons in several cortical areas. One hundred and
      twenty eight of all 234 possible between-area pair-wise comparisons were
      significantly different. The density of specific subpopulations of these cells
      also varied among cortical areas, as did the density of axon terminals.
      Comparison of PFC with other cortical areas revealed that 40 of all 66 possible
      statistical comparisons of the density of PV-ir, CB-ir, and CR-ir cells were
      significantly different. We also found evidence for heterogeneity in the pattern 
      of labeling of PV-ir, CB-ir, and CR-ir cells and axon terminals between the
      dorsolateral and orbital subdivisions of PFC. These data are likely to reflect
      basic differences in interneuron circuitry, which are likely to influence
      inhibitory function in the cortex.

TI  - Does excessive memory load attenuate activation in the prefrontal cortex?
      Load-dependent processing in single and dual tasks: functional magnetic resonance
      imaging study.
PG  - 210-25
AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate the relationship
      between cortical activation and memory load in dual tasks. An n-back task at four
      levels of difficulty was used with auditory-verbal and visual-nonverbal material,
      performed separately as single tasks and simultaneously as dual tasks. With
      reference to single tasks, activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) commonly
      increases with incremental memory load, whereas for dual tasks it has been
      hypothesized previously that activity in the PFC decreases in the face of
      excessive processing demands, i.e., if the capacity of the working memory's
      central executive system is exceeded. However, our results show that during both 
      single and dual tasks, prefrontal activation increases continuously as a function
      of memory load. An increase of prefrontal activation was observed in the dual
      tasks even though processing demands were excessive in the case of the most
      difficult condition, as indicated by behavioral accuracy measures. The hypothesis
      concerning the decrease in prefrontal activation could not be supported and was
      discussed in terms of motivation factors. Similar changes in load-dependent
      activation were observed in two other regions outside the PFC, namely in the
      precentral gyrus and the superior parietal lobule. The results suggest that
      excessive processing demands in dual tasks are not necessarily accompanied by a
      diminution in cortical activity.

TI  - Pre-frontal executive committee for perception, working memory, attention,
      long-term memory, motor control, and thinking: a tutorial review.
PG  - 83-139
AB  - As an explicit organizing metaphor, memory aid, and conceptual framework, the
      prefrontal cortex may be viewed as a five-member 'Executive Committee,' as the
      prefrontal-control extensions of five sub-and-posterior-cortical systems: (1) the
      'Perceiver' (dominant-right-hemisphere ventral-lateral prefrontal
      cortex--VL/PERC-PFC) is the frontal extension of the ventral perceptual stream
      (the VL/PERC system) which represents the world and self in object coordinates;
      (2) the 'Verbalizer' (dominant-left-hemisphere ventral-lateral prefrontal cortex 
      system--VL/VERB-PFC) is the frontal extension of the language stream (the VL/VERB
      system) which represents the world and self in language coordinates; (3) the
      'Motivator' (ventral/medial-orbital pre-frontal cortex--VMO-PFC) is the frontal
      cortical extension of a subcortical extended-amygdala stream (the VMO system)
      which represents the world and self in motivational/emotional coordinates; (4)
      the 'Attender' (dorsal-medial/anterior cingulate--DM/AC-PFC) is the frontal
      cortical extension of a subcortical extended-hippocampal stream (the DM/AC
      system) which represents the world and self in spatiotemporal coordinates and
      directs attention to internal and external events; and (5) the 'Coordinator' (the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex--DL-PFC) is the frontal extension of the dorsal
      perceptual stream (the DL system) which represents the world and self in body-
      and eye-coordinates and controls willed action and working memory. This tutorial 
      review examines the interacting roles of these five systems in perception,
      working memory, attention, long-term memory, motor control, and thinking.

TI  - The role of prefrontal cortex in working-memory capacity, executive attention,
      and general fluid intelligence: an individual-differences perspective.
PG  - 637-71
AB  - We provide an "executive-attention" framework for organizing the cognitive
      neuroscience research on the constructs of working-memory capacity (WMC), general
      fluid intelligence, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) function. Rather than provide a
      novel theory of PFC function, we synthesize a wealth of single-cell,
      brain-imaging, and neuropsychological research through the lens of our theory of 
      normal individual differences in WMC and attention control (Engle, Kane, &
      Tuholski, 1999; Engle, Tuholski, Laughlin, & Conway, 1999). Our critical review
      confirms the prevalent view that dorsolateral PFC circuitry is critical to
      executive-attention functions. Moreover, although the dorsolateral PFC is but one
      critical structure in a network of anterior and posterior "attention control"
      areas, it does have a unique executive-attention role in actively maintaining
      access to stimulus representations and goals in interference-rich contexts. Our
      review suggests the utility of an executive-attention framework for guiding
      future research on both PFC function and cognitive control.

TI  - Impairment in abstraction and set shifting in aged rhesus monkeys.
PG  - 125-34
AB  - Understanding the nature of changes in cognition with aging has increased in
      importance as the number of individuals over the age of 65 years grows. To date, 
      studies have demonstrated that age-related changes occur most extensively in the 
      cognitive domains of memory and executive function. Whereas a large number of
      studies have been conducted about the effects of aging on memory, far less have
      explored the effects of aging on the so called "executive function" which include
      abilities essential for successful performance of higher level activities of
      daily living. As part of our ongoing effort to better characterize these changes,
      we assessed executive function in a non-human primate model of normal human aging
      using the Conceptual Set Shifting Task (CSST). This recently developed task
      assesses abstraction, concept formation and set shifting in the monkey in a way
      analogous to the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) in humans. Relative to young 
      adult monkeys, aged monkeys evidenced significant difficulty in both acquisition 
      and performance on this task, and moreover, demonstrated a high degree of
      perseverative responding. The pattern of performance displayed by the aged
      monkeys suggests an age-related decline in prefrontal cortex (PFC) functioning.

TI  - Executive control during episodic retrieval: multiple prefrontal processes
      subserve source memory.
PG  - 989-96
AB  - During recognition, one may sense items as familiar (item memory) and
      additionally recollect specific contextual details of the earlier encounters
      (source memory). Cognitive theory suggests that, unlike item memory, source
      memory requires controlled cue specification and monitoring processes. Functional
      imaging suggests that such processes may depend on left prefrontal cortex (PFC). 
      However, the nature and possible anatomical segregation of these processes
      remains unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we isolated
      distinct response patterns in left PFC during source memory consistent with
      semantic analysis/cue specification (anterior ventrolateral), recollective
      monitoring (posterior dorsolateral and frontopolar), and phonological
      maintenance/rehearsal (posterior ventrolateral). Importantly, cue specification
      and recollective monitoring responses were not seen during item memory and were
      unaffected by retrieval success, demonstrating that the mere attempt to recollect
      episodic detail engages multiple control processes with different left PFC
      substrates.

TI  - Working memory neurons in pigeons.
PG  - RC210
AB  - Working memory, the ability to temporarily store and manipulate currently
      relevant information, is required for most cognitive faculties. In humans and
      other mammals, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) provides the underlying neural network
      for these processes. Within the PFC, working memory neurons display sustained
      elevated activity while holding active an internal representation of the relevant
      stimulus during its physical absence or retaining a motor plan for the
      forthcoming response. Working memory, however, is not a hallmark of higher
      vertebrates endowed with a neocortex. Birds also master complex cognitive
      problems invoking working memory, but they lack a laminated neocortex. Behavioral
      studies in pigeons show that the neostriatum caudolaterale (NCL) plays a central 
      role in executive functions, such as working memory and response control. For
      neurons in the NCL of pigeons, we show activity changes during the delay of a
      working memory task, which were similar to those observed in PFC neurons and were
      related to the successful holding of information in memory and to the subsequent 
      behavior. Thus, although the anatomical and morphological structure of the
      neuronal substrate in birds is radically different from the mammalian neocortical
      architecture, the neuronal mechanisms evolved to master equivalent cognitive
      demands seem to be very similar.

TI  - HPA axis and stimulant dependence: an enigmatic relationship.
PG  - 5-12
AB  - Clinical and preclinical evidence links stress to drug dependence. Stress is
      accompanied by the rapid modification of brain and body physiology which leads to
      release of neuroactive hormones, including biogenic amines and adrenal steroids, 
      which activate the same brain circuitry, as stimulant drugs, such as cocaine and 
      amphetamines. Some preclinical studies showed that stress and elevated plasma
      concentrations of glucocorticoids increase acquisition and maintenance of
      stimulant use in rats, whereas other studies revealed that animals with
      inherently hypoactive HPA axis are more vulnerable to stimulant "abuse". In
      humans cocaine acutely activates the HPA axis, and in chronic cocaine abusers
      early abstinence is accompanied by alterations of the HPA axis function, with
      distinct patterns of hormonal changes characteristic for different subgroups of
      addicts. Some of these changes correspond to psychiatric comorbidities, which may
      be predictive of propensity to relapse. Hemispheric laterality plays a role in
      the stress-induced activation of the HPA axis, with right prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      having mostly stimulatory effects and the left, inhibitory effects. Brain-imaging
      studies showed preferential alteration of structure and function of the right
      cerebral hemisphere in cocaine addicts. Activation of the right PFC and
      inhibition of the left was noted in typical depressive disorders, and right
      hemispheric hypoactivity was reported in attention deficit hyperactivity and
      antisocial personality disorders, which are highly comorbid with stimulant
      dependence. Distinct patterns of hemispheric predominance or hypofunction between
      individuals may contribute to vulnerability or resilience to stimulant
      dependence. The nature and significance of the link between stress and activity
      of HPA axis, and vulnerability to drug dependence is not clear and deserves
      further study.

TI  - Prefrontal contributions to executive control: fMRI evidence for functional
      distinctions within lateral Prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 1337-47
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a fundamental role in internally guided
      behavior. Although it is generally accepted that PFC subserves working memory and
      executive control operations, it remains unclear whether the subregions within
      lateral PFC support distinct executive control processes. An event-related fMRI
      study was implemented to test the hypothesis that ventrolateral and dorsolateral 
      PFC are functionally distinct, as well as to assess whether functional
      specialization exists within ventrolateral PFC. Participants performed two
      executive control tasks that differed in the types of control processes required.
      During rote rehearsal, participants covertly rehearsed three words in the order
      presented, thus requiring phonological access and maintenance. During elaborative
      rehearsal, participants made semantic comparisons between three words held in
      working memory, reordering them from least to most desirable. Thus, in addition
      to maintenance, elaborative rehearsal required goal-relevant coding of items in
      working memory ("monitoring") and selection from among the items to implement
      their reordering. Results revealed that left posterior ventrolateral PFC was
      active during performance of both tasks, whereas right dorsolateral PFC was
      differentially engaged during elaborative rehearsal. The temporal characteristics
      of the hemodynamic responses further suggested that dorsolateral activation
      lagged ventrolateral activation. Finally, differential activation patterns were
      observed within left ventrolateral PFC, distinguishing between posterior and
      anterior regions. These data suggest that anatomically separable subregions
      within lateral PFC may be functionally distinct and are consistent with models
      that posit a hierarchical relationship between dorsolateral and ventrolateral
      regions such that the former monitors and selects goal-relevant representations
      being maintained by the latter.

TI  - Delay-dependent modulation of memory retrieval by infusion of a dopamine D1
      agonist into the rat medial prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 934-9
AB  - Dopamine (DA) in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) can modulate the short-term
      retention of information and other executive functions. The present study
      examined whether administration of a DA D1 agonist into the PFC could have
      differential effects on memory retrieval in circumstances in which memory was
      either excellent or poor. Separate groups of rats were trained on a delayed
      version of the radial maze task. On the test day, the delay between the phases
      was either 30 min or 12 hr. Infusions of the D1 receptor agonist SKF 81297 (0.05,
      0.10, or 0.20 microg/0.5 microl) into the PFC before the test phase improved
      memory retrieval after a 12-hr delay but disrupted performance after a 30-min
      delay. These data suggest that D1 receptor activity can exert differential
      effects over PFC function, depending on the strength of the memory trace. When
      memory is decremented by an extended delay, activation of PFC DA D1 receptors by 
      an agonist can improve cognitive function.

TI  - Activity in human frontal cortex associated with spatial working memory and
      saccadic behavior.
PG  - 2-14
AB  - We examined, with event-related fMRI, two hypotheses about the organization of
      human working memory function in frontal cortex: (1) that a region immediately
      anterior to the frontal eye fields (FEF) (superior frontal cortex, SFC) is
      specialized for spatial working memory (Courtney, et al., 1998); and (2) that
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a privileged role in the manipulation 
      of spatial stimuli held in working memory (Owen, et al., 1996; Petrides 1994).
      Our delayed-response task featured 2-D arrays of irregularly arranged squares
      that were highlighted serially in a random sequence. The Forward Memory condition
      required maintenance of the spatio-temporal sequence, the Manipulate Memory
      condition required reordering this sequence into a new spatially defined order,
      the Guided Saccade condition required saccades to highlighted squares in the
      array, but no memory, and the Free Saccade condition required self-paced,
      horizontal saccades. The comparison of fMRI signal intensity associated with 2-D 
      saccade generation (Guided Saccades) versus fMRI signal intensity associated with
      the delay period of the working memorials condition revealed no evidence for
      greater working memory-related activity than saccade-related activity in SFC in
      any individual subject, nor at the level of the group, and greater 2-D saccade
      than delay-period activity in three of five subjects. These results fail to
      support the hypothesis that spatial working memory-related activity is
      represented preferentially in a region of SFC anterior to the FEF (Courtney, et
      al., 1998). The comparison of maintenance versus manipulation of spatio-temporal 
      information in working memory revealed significantly greater activity associated 
      with the latter in dorsolateral PFC, but not in ventrolateral PFC or in SFC.
      These results suggest that the delay-related function of SFC is limited to the
      maintenance of spatial information, and that this region does not support the
      nonmnemonic executive control functions supported by dorsolateral PFC. These
      results also indicate that the preferential recruitment of dorsolateral PFC for
      the manipulation of information held in working memory applies to tasks employing
      spatial stimuli, as well as to tasks employing verbal stimuli (D'Esposito, et
      al., 1999); Petrides et al., 1993; Postle et al., 1999).

TI  - Control of semantic interference in episodic memory retrieval is associated with 
      an anterior cingulate-prefrontal activation pattern.
PG  - 94-103
AB  - Prefrontal activation is a consistent finding in functional neuroimaging studies 
      of episodic memory retrieval. In the present study we aimed at a further analysis
      of prefrontal neural systems involved in the executive control of
      context-specific properties in episodic memory retrieval using an event-related
      fMRI design. Nine subjects were asked to learn two 20-item word lists that
      consisted of concrete nouns assigned to four semantic categories. Ten items of
      both word lists referred to the same semantic category. Subjects were instructed 
      to determine whether nouns displayed in random order corresponded to the first
      20-item target list. The interference evoked by the retrieval of semantically
      related items of the second list resulted in significantly longer reaction times 
      compared to the noninterference condition. Contrasting the interference against
      the noninterference retrieval condition demonstrated an activation pattern that
      comprised a right anterior cingulate and frontal opercular area and a
      left-lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal region. Trial averaged time series
      revealed that the PFC areas were selectively activated at the interference
      condition and did not respond to the familiarity of learned words. These findings
      suggest a functionally separable role of prefrontal cortical areas mediating
      processes associated with the executive control of interfering context
      information in episodic memory retrieval.

TI  - The effects of local application of D2 selective dopaminergic drugs into the
      medial prefrontal cortex of rats in a delayed spatial choice task.
PG  - 99-111
AB  - The study examined the effects of modulation of dopamine D2 receptors-mediated
      neurotransmission in the rat's prefrontal cortex (PFC) on storage and executive
      components of working memory. Rats were trained on delayed (delay interval, 3 s) 
      and non-delayed choice in a U-maze. The prominence of proactive interference was 
      evaluated by sorting errors in a current trial on the basis of animal reactions
      in a preceding trial. The erroneous runs to the same arm of the maze as in the
      previous trial were identified as the repetitions (RE) and the erroneous runs to 
      the other arm in comparison with the previous trial were classified as
      alternations (AE). The bilateral microinfusion of D2 agonists PPHT (0.004 microg,
      0.04 microg, 0.4 microg/1 microl) into medial wall of the PFC produced a
      dose-dependent increase in the error rate of the delayed-response task and did
      not influence non-delayed choice. In delay condition PPHT enhanced the
      perseverative tendencies (the rate of RE was significantly higher than the rate
      of AE), in non-delayed choice the erroneous performance was mainly represented by
      AE. In contrast, the infusion of D2-receptor antagonist sulpiride (0.03 microg,
      0.3 microg, 3 microg/1 microl) increased the accuracy of delayed choice and
      changed the mode of intertrial dependence-rats made significantly more AE than
      RE. The results are discussed in terms of the involvement of D2 receptor
      dependent transmission of the PFC in different cognitive processes related to the
      delayed performance in U-maze (within-trial short-term storage of information
      versus dynamic control of between-trials working memory processing).

TI  - Pharmacologic strategies for augmenting cognitive performance in schizophrenia.
PG  - 1-16
AB  - There is recognition that the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia have the most
      substantial impact on illness outcome. Domains of cognition reported to be
      significantly affected include serial learning, executive function, vigilance,
      and distractibility, to name a few. Dopamine activity at D1 receptors mediates
      many cognitive processes subserved by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly
      working memory. The number of D1 receptors in the PFC is decreased in
      schizophrenics and is unaffected by chronic administration of typical
      neuroleptics. Therefore, medications that increase dopamine in the PFC, such as
      atypical neuroleptics, or that directly activate the D1 receptor may prove useful
      in the remediation of prefrontal-dependent cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.
      Decreased levels of cortical norepinephrine (NE) are associated with impaired
      learning and working memory in animal models, and can be reversed by drugs that
      restore NE activity. More specifically, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists have
      been particularly effective in improving delayed response performance in young
      monkeys with localized 6-hydroxydopamine lesions in the PFC. Furthermore, human
      postmortem studies have demonstrated decreased NE in the frontal cortex of
      demented schizophrenic patients. Therefore, alpha-2 receptor agonists hold
      promise as drugs to improve cognitive performance on tasks dependent upon PFC
      function in schizophrenics. Finally, the finding that cortical choline acetyl
      transferase activity correlates with Clinical Dementia Rating scores in
      schizophrenic patients and that cholinomimetic drugs enhance cognition in healthy
      subjects suggests that cholinergic drugs may also treat cognitive symptoms in
      schizophrenia. Two potential types of cholinomimetics for use in schizophrenics
      are the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and M1/M4 muscarinic agonists, both of
      which increase cortical cholinergic activity.

TI  - The functional roles of prefrontal cortex in episodic memory. I. Encoding.
PG  - 1239-48
AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies of episodic memory consistently report an
      association between memory encoding operations and left prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      activation. Encoding-related activation has been described in dorsolateral,
      ventrolateral and anterior prefrontal regions. We tested the hypothesis that a
      specific component of this left PFC activation reflects organizational processes 
      necessary for optimal memory encoding. Subjects underwent PET scans while
      learning auditorily presented word lists under dual task conditions. The degree
      to which they were required to organize word lists semantically was
      systematically varied across three experimental conditions. A task in which words
      were already organized produced the least degree of left PFC activity whereas a
      task requiring subjects to generate an organizational structure was associated
      with maximal activity in this region. This activation was localized to a region
      just above the inferior frontal sulcus. The functional specificity of this
      increased activity for organizational processes was tested using a concurrent
      distracting task known to disrupt these processes. Distraction resulted in a
      significant attenuation of this activation during the task emphasizing
      organizational processes but not other encoding tasks. In contrast, the
      distraction task resulted in reduced activity in a more ventral/anterior PFC
      region expressed equally for all memory tasks. The findings indicate that a key
      function of left dorsolateral PFC at encoding relates specifically to the use of 
      executive processes necessary for the creation of an organizational structure.
      Activity in more ventral and anterior left PFC regions would appear to reflect a 
      less specific component of episodic memory encoding.

TI  - A connectionist approach to the prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 241-53
AB  - Recent data from studies of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in humans and laboratory 
      animals are reviewed with particular reference to the anatomical substrates of
      prefrontal neuropsychological function in health and disease. The PFC has been
      shown to have a unique pattern of supramodal connectivity with intracortical and 
      subcortical circuits that place the PFC in an anatomical position to subserve
      "executive" cognitive functions and modulate limbic information to relate to
      basal ganglia circuits in a highly specific manner and to uniquely control the
      neurochemical elements of attention and reward. PFC connectivity is also
      consistent with current hypotheses about prefrontal neuropsychology, which
      emphasize conscious, goal-directed behavior guided by past experience. PFC
      connectivity explains the frequency with which prefrontal dysfunction is seen in 
      disease states, which, on the basis of neuroimaging and neuropathology data, can 
      be categorized as either intrinsic or dysconnection disorders.
