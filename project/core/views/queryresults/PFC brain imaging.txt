AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying impairments in
      generalizing learning shown by adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
      METHOD: A total of 21 high-functioning individuals with ASD aged 12 to 18 years, 
      and 23 gender-, IQ-, and age-matched adolescents with typical development (TYP), 
      completed a transitive inference (TI) task implemented using rapid event-related 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were trained on
      overlapping pairs in a stimulus hierarchy of colored ovals where A>B>C>D>E>F and 
      then tested on generalizing this training to new stimulus pairings (AF, BD, BE)
      in a "Big Game." Whole-brain univariate, region of interest, and functional
      connectivity analyses were used. RESULTS: During training, the TYP group
      exhibited increased recruitment of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas the group
      with ASD showed greater functional connectivity between the PFC and the anterior 
      cingulate cortex (ACC). Both groups recruited the hippocampus and caudate
      comparably; however, functional connectivity between these regions was positively
      associated with TI performance for only the group with ASD. During the Big Game, 
      the TYP group showed greater recruitment of the PFC, parietal cortex, and the
      ACC. Recruitment of these regions increased with age in the group with ASD.
      CONCLUSION: During TI, TYP individuals recruited cognitive control-related brain 
      regions implicated in mature problem solving/reasoning including the PFC,
      parietal cortex, and ACC, whereas the group with ASD showed functional
      connectivity of the hippocampus and the caudate that was associated with task
      performance. Failure to reliably engage cognitive control-related brain regions
      may produce less integrated flexible learning in individuals with ASD unless they
      are provided with task support that, in essence, provides them with cognitive
      control; however, this pattern may normalize with age.

AB  - Down-regulation of the amygdala with real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI NF)
      potentially allows targeting brain circuits of emotion processing and may involve
      prefrontal-limbic networks underlying effective emotion regulation. Little
      research has been dedicated to the effect of rtfMRI NF on the functional
      connectivity of the amygdala and connectivity patterns in amygdala
      down-regulation with neurofeedback have not been addressed yet. Using
      psychophysiological interaction analysis of fMRI data, we present evidence that
      voluntary amygdala down-regulation by rtfMRI NF while viewing aversive pictures
      was associated with increased connectivity of the right amygdala with the
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in healthy subjects (N=16). In contrast, a
      control group (N=16) receiving sham feedback did not alter amygdala connectivity 
      (GroupxCondition t-contrast: p<.05 at cluster-level). Task-dependent increases in
      amygdala-vmPFC connectivity were predicted by picture arousal (beta=.59, p<.05). 
      A dynamic causal modeling analysis with Bayesian model selection aimed at further
      characterizing the underlying causal structure and favored a bottom-up model
      assuming predominant information flow from the amygdala to the vmPFC (xp=.90).
      The results were complemented by the observation of task-dependent alterations in
      functional connectivity of the vmPFC with the visual cortex and the ventrolateral
      PFC in the experimental group (Condition t-contrast: p<.05 at cluster-level).
      Taken together, the results underscore the potential of amygdala fMRI
      neurofeedback to influence functional connectivity in key networks of emotion
      processing and regulation. This may be beneficial for patients suffering from
      severe emotion dysregulation by improving neural self-regulation.

TI  - Chronic back pain is associated with decreased prefrontal and anterior insular
      gray matter. Results from a population-based cohort study.

LID - 10.1016/j.jpain.2015.10.003 [doi]
AB  - Chronic back pain (CBP) is associated with circumscribed atrophy in gray matter
      (GM) predominantly localized in areas of the so called "pain matrix" and the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). Previous studies applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM) 
      for identifying structural brain alterations related to CBP have reported
      inconsistent results, are limited to small sample sizes and often did not control
      for medication. We therefore used VBM for high resolution magnetic resonance
      images to investigate the association of CBP and regional GM volume in 111
      individuals with CBP und 432 pain free controls derived from the representative
      Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP), while controlling for effects of medication.
      CBP was associated with decreased regional GM in the ventrolateral (VLPFC) and
      dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), both the ventral and dorsal medial PFC (mPFC) and the
      anterior insula. Pain intensity showed a weak negative correlated with GM volume 
      in the left DLPFC, VLPFC and ACC. The CBP sample showed alterations in regions
      commonly associated with pain processing and emotional demands. To our knowledge,
      this is the first VBM study reporting decreased regional GM volume in the mPFC in
      a CBP sample. However, we were unable to confirm alterations in regions other
      than the DLPFC and the insula. PERSPECTIVE: Previous studies reported
      inconsistent results for brain areas altered in chronic pain conditions that may 
      be in part attributable to small sample sizes, medication use or emotional
      comorbidities. This study in a large and representative cohort helps to clarify
      these issues.

AB  - Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) studies in schizophrenia patients
      generally report decreased levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), glutamate and
      glutathione, particularly in frontal cortex. However, these data are inconsistent
      in part due to confounds associated with clinical samples. The lack of validated 
      diagnostic biomarkers also hampers analysis of the neurodevelopmental trajectory 
      of neurochemical abnormalities. Rodent models are powerful tools to address these
      issues, particularly when combined with 1H MRS (clinically comparable
      technology). We investigated the trajectory of metabolic changes in the
      prefrontal cortex during brain maturation from adolescence to adulthood in vivo
      using 1H MRS in rats exposed prenatally to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (POL),
      a rodent model of maternal immune activation (MIA), an epidemiological risk
      factor for several psychiatric disorders with a neurodevelopmental origin.
      Longitudinal in vivo 1H MRS revealed a significant decrease in PFC levels of GSH 
      and taurine in adult, but not adolescent rats. Significant agexMIA interactions
      for PFC levels of NAA were also observed. These data replicate some deficits
      observed in the PFC of patients with schizophrenia. There were no significant
      changes in the levels of glutamate or any other metabolite. These data suggest
      prenatal exposure to POL leads to subtle metabolic perturbations of the normal
      maturing PFC, which may be related to subsequent behavioural abnormalities.
      Further work is however required to examine any potential confound of shipping
      stress on the presumed imbalances in PFC metabolites in POL-exposed offspring.
      Testing the interactions between MIA with stress or genetic risk variants will
      also be an important advance.

AB  - Sickness behaviors have become the focus of great interest in recent years as
      they represent a clear case of how peripheral disturbances in immune signaling
      can disrupt quite complex behaviors. In the current study, we were interested in 
      examining whether we could identify any significant morphological disturbances in
      microglia associated with these sickness-like behaviors in adult male
      Sprague-Dawley rats. We chose lipopolysaccharide (LPS 100mug/kg/i.p.), to induce 
      sickness-like behaviors as it is the most well-validated approach to do so in
      rodents and humans. We were particularly interested in examining changes in
      microglia within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as several recent neuroimaging
      studies have highlighted significant functional changes in this region following 
      peripheral LPS administration. Paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue was collected from
      animals 24h post LPS administration and labeled immunohistochemically with an
      antibody directed to bind to Iba-1, a protein known to be involved in the
      structural remodeling of microglia. To analyze changes, we have made use of two
      recently described image analysis procedures. The first is known as cumulative
      threshold spectra (CTS) analysis. The second involves the unsupervised digital
      reconstruction of microglia. We undertook these complementary analysis of
      microglial cells in the both the pre- and infralimbic divisions of the PFC. Our
      results indicated that microglial soma size was significantly enlarged, while
      cell processes had contracted slightly following LPS administration. To our
      knowledge this study is to first to definitely demonstrate substantial microglial
      disturbances within the PFC following LPS delivered at a dose that was sufficient
      to induce significant sickness-like behavior.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its connections with other brain areas are
      crucial for cognitive function. Cognitive impairments are one of the core
      symptoms associated with schizophrenia, and manifest even before the onset of the
      disorder. Altered neural networks involving PFC contribute to cognitive
      impairments in schizophrenia. Both genetic and environmental risk factors affect 
      the development of the local circuitry within PFC as well as development of
      broader brain networks, and make the system vulnerable to further insults during 
      adolescence, leading to the onset of the disorder in young adulthood. Since
      spared cognitive functions correlate with functional outcome and prognosis, a
      better understanding of the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments will have
      important implications for novel therapeutics for schizophrenia focusing on
      cognitive functions. Multidisciplinary approaches, from basic neuroscience to
      clinical studies, are required to link molecules, circuitry, networks, and
      behavioral phenotypes. Close interactions among such fields by sharing a common
      language on connectomes, behavioral readouts, and other concepts are crucial for 
      this goal.

AB  - Deficits in verbal learning and memory are a prominent feature of neurocognitive 
      function in HIV-infected women, and are associated with high levels of perceived 
      stress. To understand the neurobiological factors contributing to this
      stress-related memory impairment, we examined the association between stress,
      verbal memory, and brain volumes in HIV-infected women. Participants included 38 
      HIV-infected women (Mean age=43.9years) from the Chicago Consortium of the
      Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). Participants underwent structural magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) and completed standardized measures of verbal learning
      and memory and stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10; PSS-10). Brain volumes were
      evaluated in a priori regions of interest, including the medial temporal lobe
      (MTL) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Compared to HIV-infected women with lower
      stress (PSS-10 scores in lower two tertiles), HIV-infected women with higher
      stress (scores in the top tertile), performed worse on measures of verbal
      learning and memory and showed smaller volumes bilaterally in the parahippocampal
      gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus
      (p's<0.05). Reduced volumes in the inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, 
      and superior frontal gyrus (all right hemisphere) were negatively associated with
      verbal learning and memory performance. Prefrontal cortical atrophy is associated
      with stress-related deficits in verbal learning and memory in HIV-infected women.
      The time course of these volume losses in relation to memory deficits has yet to 
      be elucidated, but the magnitude of the volumetric differences between women with
      higher versus lower stress suggests a prolonged vulnerability due to chronic
      stress and/or early life trauma.

TI  - Decoding Episodic Retrieval Processes: Frontoparietal and Medial-temporal Lobe
      Contributions to Free Recall.
PG  - 1-15
AB  - Neuroimaging studies of recognition memory have identified distinct patterns of
      cortical activity associated with two sets of cognitive processes: Recollective
      processes supporting retrieval of information specifying a probe item's original 
      source are associated with the posterior hippocampus, ventral posterior parietal 
      cortex, and medial pFC. Familiarity processes supporting the correct
      identification of previously studied probes (in the absence of a recollective
      response) are associated with activity in anterior medial-temporal lobe (MTL)
      structures including the perirhinal cortex and anterior hippocampus, in addition 
      to lateral prefrontal and dorsal posterior parietal cortex. Here, we address an
      open question in the cognitive neuroscientific literature: To what extent are
      these same neurocognitive processes engaged during an internally directed memory 
      search task like free recall? We recorded fMRI activity while participants
      performed a series of free recall and source recognition trials, and we used a
      combination of univariate and multivariate analysis techniques to compare neural 
      activation profiles across the two tasks. Univariate analyses showed that
      posterior MTL regions were commonly associated with recollective processes during
      source recognition and with free recall responses. Prefrontal and posterior
      parietal regions were commonly associated with familiarity processes and free
      recall responses, whereas anterior MTL regions were only associated with
      familiarity processes during recognition. In contrast with the univariate
      results, free recall activity patterns characterized using multivariate pattern
      analysis did not reliably match the neural patterns associated with recollective 
      processes. However, these free recall patterns did reliably match patterns
      associated with familiarity processes, supporting theories of memory in which
      common cognitive mechanisms support both item recognition and free recall.

AB  - Deficits in reward anticipation are putative mechanisms for multiple
      psychopathologies. Research indicates that these deficits are characterized by
      reduced left (relative to right) frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and 
      blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal abnormalities in mesolimbic and
      prefrontal neural regions during reward anticipation. Although it is often
      assumed that these two measures capture similar mechanisms, no study to our
      knowledge has directly examined the convergence between frontal EEG alpha
      asymmetry and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during reward
      anticipation in the same sample. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to
      investigate if and where in the brain frontal EEG alpha asymmetry and fMRI
      measures were correlated in a sample of 40 adults. All participants completed two
      analogous reward anticipation tasks-once during EEG data collection and the other
      during fMRI data collection. Results indicated that the two measures do converge 
      and that during reward anticipation, increased relative left frontal activity is 
      associated with increased left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)/medial prefrontal 
      cortex (mPFC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activation. This suggests that 
      the two measures may similarly capture PFC functioning, which is noteworthy given
      the role of these regions in reward processing and the pathophysiology of
      disorders such as depression and schizophrenia.

AB  - Working memory (WM) refers to the temporary holding and manipulation of
      information during the performance of a range of cognitive tasks, and WM training
      is a promising method for improving an individual's cognitive functions. Our
      previous work demonstrated that WM performance can be improved through
      self-regulation of dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation using
      real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI), which enables
      individuals to control local brain activities volitionally according to the
      neurofeedback. Furthermore, research concerning large-scale brain networks has
      demonstrated that WM training requires the engagement of several networks,
      including the central executive network (CEN), the default mode network (DMN) and
      the salience network (SN), and functional connectivity within the CEN and DMN can
      be changed by WM training. Although a switching role of the SN between the CEN
      and DMN has been demonstrated, it remains unclear whether WM training can affect 
      the interactions between the three networks and whether a similar mechanism also 
      exists during the training process. In this study, we investigated the dynamic
      functional connectivity between the three networks during the rtfMRI feedback
      training using independent component analysis (ICA) and correlation analysis. The
      results indicated that functional connectivity within and between the three
      networks were significantly enhanced by feedback training, and most of the
      changes were associated with the insula and correlated with behavioral
      improvements. These findings suggest that the insula plays a critical role in the
      reorganization of functional connectivity among the three networks induced by
      rtfMRI training and in WM performance, thus providing new insights into the
      mechanisms of high-level functions and the clinical treatment of related
      functional impairments.

AB  - The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, a pathologic hallmark of
      Alzheimer's disease, has been associated with functional alterations in
      cognitively normal elderly, most often in the context of episodic memory with a
      particular emphasis on the medial temporal lobes. The topography of Abeta
      deposition, however, highly overlaps with frontoparietal control (FPC) regions
      implicated in cognitive control/working memory. To examine Abeta-related
      functional alternations in the FPC regions during a working memory task, we
      imaged 42 young and 57 cognitively normal elderly using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging during a letter Sternberg task with varying load. Based on
      18F-florbetaben-positron emission tomography scan, we determined older subjects' 
      amyloid positivity (Abeta+) status. Within brain regions commonly recruited by
      all subject groups during the delay period, age and Abeta deposition were
      independently associated with load-dependent frontoparietal hyperactivation,
      whereas additional compensatory Abeta-related hyperactivity was found beyond the 
      FPC regions. The present results suggest that Abeta-related hyperactivation is
      not specific to the episodic memory system but occurs in the PFC regions as well.

AB  - Measures of psychopathy have been proved to be valuable for risk assessment in
      violent criminals. However, the neuronal basis of psychopathy and its
      contribution to the prediction of criminal recidivism is still poorly understood.
      We compared structural imaging data from 40 male high-risk violent offenders and 
      37 non-delinquent healthy controls via voxel-based morphometry. Psychopathic
      traits and risk of violence recidivism were correlated with gray matter volume
      (GMV) of regions of interest previously shown relevant for criminal behavior.
      Relative to controls, criminals showed less GMV in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      and more GMV in cerebellar regions and basal ganglia structures. Within
      criminals, we found a negative correlation between prefrontal GMV and
      psychopathy. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between cerebellar
      GMV and psychopathy as well as risk of recidivism for violence. Moreover, GMVs of
      the basal ganglia and supplementary motor area (SMA) were positively correlated
      with anti-sociality. GMV of the amygdala was negatively correlated with dynamic
      risk for violence recidivism. In contrast, GMV of (para)limbic areas
      (orbitofrontal cortex, insula) was positively correlated with anti-sociality and 
      risk of violence recidivism. The current investigation revealed that in violent
      offenders deviations in GMV of the PFC as well as areas involved in the motor
      component of impulse control (cerebellum, basal ganglia, SMA) are differentially 
      related to psychopathic traits and the risk of violence recidivism. The results
      might be valuable for improving existing risk assessment tools.

TI  - Step-down vs. step-up noxious stimulation: differential effects on pain
      perception and patterns of brain activation.
LID - 10.1111/aas.12607 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesize that pain and brain responses are affected by changes 
      in the presentation sequence of noxious stimuli that are, overall, identical in
      intensity and duration. METHODS: During functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) scanning, 21 participants experienced three patterns of noxious
      stimulation: Up-type (step-up noxious stimulation, 15 s), Down-type (step-down
      noxious stimulation, 15 s), and Down-up-type (decreasing and increasing pattern
      of noxious stimulation, 15 s). The total intensity and duration of the three
      noxious stimulation patterns were identical, but the stimulation sequences were
      different. RESULTS: Pain and unpleasantness ratings in the Down- and Down-up-type
      noxious stimulations were lower than in the Up-type noxious stimulation. The left
      prefrontal cortex [(PFC, BA (Brodmann area) 10, (-45, 50, 1)] was more highly
      activated in the Down- and Down-up-type noxious stimulations than in the Up-type 
      noxious stimulation. The S1, S2, insula, bilateral PFC (BA 46), and midcingulate 
      cortex were more highly activated in the Up-type noxious stimulation than in the 
      Down-type noxious stimulation. PFC BA 10 was located at an inferior level
      compared to the bilateral PFC BA 46 (Z axis = 1 for BA 10, compared to 22 and 25 
      for the right and left BA 46, respectively). When cortisol level was increased,
      the left hippocampal cortex, along with the left parahippocampal cortex, was
      greatly activated for the Up-type noxious stimulation. CONCLUSION: When pain
      cannot be avoided in clinical practice, noxious stimuli should be applied to
      patients in a step-down pattern that delivers the most intense pain first and the
      least intense pain last.

AB  - The ability to overcome distraction is critical to a number of goal-directed
      behaviors, but information that is not relevant to our goals often captures our
      attention and distracts us from the task at hand. Neuroimaging work has
      demonstrated that activity in specific regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) is related to the suppression of distracting information, implicating PFC
      as a critical node in the goal-directed control network. In the current work we
      asked whether applying transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) to PFC
      would influence the likelihood of attentional capture by salient, task-irrelevant
      visual information encountered during visual search. Our results showed that
      anodal stimulation, relative to sham or cathodal stimulation, led to a transient 
      decrease in attentional capture lasting approximately 15min after stimulation.
      This provides causal evidence that PFC is involved in goal-directed control over 
      distraction, and provides a basis for using PFC stimulation as a causal tool to
      understand deficits in goal-directed control in both neurologically healthy and
      impaired populations.

TI  - Abnormal prefrontal cortex resting state functional connectivity and severity of 
      internet gaming disorder.
AB  - Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) among adolescents has become an important public
      concern and gained more and more attention internationally. Recent studies
      focused on IGD and revealed brain abnormalities in the IGD group, especially the 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, the role of PFC-striatal circuits in pathology 
      of IGD remains unknown. Twenty-five adolescents with IGD and 21 age- and
      gender-matched healthy controls were recruited in our study. Voxel-based
      morphometric (VBM) and functional connectivity analysis were employed to
      investigate the abnormal structural and resting-state properties of several
      frontal regions in individuals with online gaming addiction. Relative to healthy 
      comparison subjects, IGD subjects showed significant decreased gray matter volume
      in PFC regions including the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC),
      orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the right
      supplementary motor area (SMA) after controlling for age and gender effects. We
      chose these regions as the seeding areas for the resting-state analysis and found
      that IGD subjects showed decreased functional connectivity between several
      cortical regions and our seeds, including the insula, and temporal and occipital 
      cortices. Moreover, significant decreased functional connectivity between some
      important subcortical regions, i.e., dorsal striatum, pallidum, and thalamus, and
      our seeds were found in the IGD group and some of those changes were associated
      with the severity of IGD. Our results revealed the involvement of several PFC
      regions and related PFC-striatal circuits in the process of IGD and suggested IGD
      may share similar neural mechanisms with substance dependence at the circuit
      level.

AB  - Humans monitor states of uncertainty that can guide decision-making. These
      uncertain states are evident behaviorally when humans decline to make a
      categorization response. Such behavioral uncertainty responses (URs) have also
      defined the search for metacognition in animals. While a plethora of neuroimaging
      studies have focused on uncertainty, the brain systems supporting a volitional
      strategy shift under uncertainty have not been distinguished from those observed 
      in making introspective post-hoc reports of categorization uncertainty. Using
      rapid event-related fMRI, we demonstrate that the neural activity patterns
      elicited by humans' URs are qualitatively different from those recruited by
      associative processes during categorization. Participants performed a
      one-dimensional perceptual-categorization task in which an uncertainty-response
      option let them decline to make a categorization response. Uncertainty responding
      activated a distributed network including prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior and
      posterior cingulate cortex (ACC, PCC), anterior insula, and posterior parietal
      areas; importantly, these regions were distinct from those whose activity was
      modulated by task difficulty. Generally, our results can be characterized as a
      large-scale cognitive control network including recently evolved brain regions
      such as the anterior dorsolateral and medial PFC. A metacognitive theory would
      view the UR as a deliberate behavioral adjustment rather than just a learned
      middle category response, and predicts this pattern of results. These
      neuroimaging results bolster previous behavioral findings, which suggested that
      different cognitive processes underlie responses due to associative learning
      versus the declaration of uncertainty. We conclude that the UR represents an
      elemental behavioral index of metacognition.

      genes on neural response to alcohol cues and craving.
LID - 10.1111/adb.12291 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the current study was to determine genotype effects of four single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of the N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor
      (GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2C) and kainate receptor (GRIK1), which have been previously 
      associated with alcoholism, on behavior, neural cue-reactivity and drinking
      outcome. Eighty-six abstinent alcohol dependent patients were recruited from an
      in-patient setting. Neuropsychological tests, genotyping and functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) were used to study genotype effects. GRIN2C risk allele 
      carriers displayed increased alcohol cue-induced activation in the anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Neural
      activation in the ACC positively correlated with craving for alcohol (r = 0.201, 
      P = 0.032), whereas activation in the dlPFC showed a negative association (r =
      -0.215, P = 0.023). In addition, dlPFC activation predicted time to first relapse
      (HR = 2.701, 95%CI 1.244-5.864, P = 0.012). GRIK1 risk allele carriers showed
      increased cue-induced activation in the medial prefrontal (PFC) and orbitofrontal
      cortex (OFC) and in the lateral PFC and OFC. Activation in both clusters
      positively correlated with alcohol craving (rmedOFC, medPFC = 0.403, P = 0.001,
      rlatOFC, latPFC = 0.282, P = 0.008), and activation in the cluster that
      encompassed the medial OFC predicted time to first relapse (HR = 1.911, 95%CI
      1.030-3.545, P = 0.040). Findings indicate that SNPs in the GRIN2C and GRIK1
      genes are associated with altered cue-induced brain activation that is related to
      craving for alcohol and relapse risk.

AB  - Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children often
      persist into adulthood and can lead to severe antisocial behavior. However,
      to-date it remains unclear whether neuro-functional abnormalities cause ADHD,
      which in turn can then provide a marker of persistent ADHD. Using event-related
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we measured blood oxygenation level
      dependent (BOLD) signal changes in subjects during a reversal learning task in
      which choice of the correct stimulus led to a probabilistically determined
      'monetary' reward or punishment. Participants were diagnosed with ADHD during
      their childhood (N = 32) and were paired with age, gender, and education matched 
      healthy controls (N = 32). Reassessment of the ADHD group as adults resulted in a
      split between either persistent (persisters, N = 17) or remitted ADHDs
      (remitters, N = 15). All three groups showed significantly decreased activation
      in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the left striatum during punished
      correct responses, however only remitters and controls presented significant
      psycho-physiological interaction between these fronto-striatal reward and outcome
      valence networks. Comparing persisters to remitters and controls showed
      significantly inverted responses to punishment (P < 0.05, family-wise error
      corrected) in left PFC region. Interestingly, the decreased activation shown
      after punishment was located in different areas of the PFC for remitters compared
      with controls, suggesting that remitters might have learned compensation
      strategies to overcome their ADHD symptoms. Thus, fMRI helps understanding the
      neuro-functional basis of ADHD related behavior differences and differentiates
      between persistent and remittent ADHD. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4648-4663, 2015. (c)

TI  - Neural signatures of third-party punishment: evidence from penetrating traumatic 
      brain injury.
LID - nsv105 [pii]
AB  - The ability to survive within a cooperative society depends on impartial
      third-party punishment (TPP) of social norm violations. Two cognitive mechanisms 
      have been postulated as necessary for the successful completion of TPP:
      evaluation of legal responsibility and selection of a suitable punishment given
      the magnitude of the crime. Converging neuroimaging research suggests two
      supporting domain-general networks; a mentalizing network for evaluation of legal
      responsibility and a central-executive network for determination of punishment. A
      whole-brain voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach was used in conjunction
      with a rank-order TPP task to identify brain regions necessary for TPP in a large
      sample of patients with penetrating traumatic brain injury. Patients who
      demonstrated atypical TPP had specific lesions in core regions of the mentalizing
      (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex [PFC], ventromedial PFC) and central-executive
      (bilateral dorsolateral PFC, right intraparietal sulcus) networks. Altruism and
      executive functioning (concept formation skills) were significant predictors of
      TPP: altruism was uniquely associated with TPP in patients with lesions in right 
      dorsolateral PFC and executive functioning was uniquely associated with TPP in
      individuals with lesions in left PFC. Our findings contribute to the extant
      literature to support underlying neural networks associated with TPP, with
      specific brain-behavior causal relationships confirming recent functional
      neuroimaging research.

TI  - Longitudinal Changes in Prefrontal Cortex Activation Underlie Declines in
      Adolescent Risk Taking.
PG  - 11308-14
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1553-15.2015 [doi]
AB  - Adolescence is a critical developmental phase during which risk-taking behaviors 
      increase across a variety of species, raising the importance of understanding how
      brain changes contribute to such behaviors. While the prefrontal cortex is
      thought to influence adolescent risk taking, the specific ways in which it
      functions are unclear. Using longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
      in human adolescents, we found that ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC)
      activation decreased during an experimental risk-taking task over time, with
      greater declines in VLPFC associated with greater declines in self-reported risky
      behavior. Furthermore, greater decreases in functional coupling between the
      medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and ventral striatum over time were associated
      with decreases in self-reported risky behavior. Thus, disparate roles of the
      VLPFC and MPFC modulate longitudinal declines in adolescent risk taking.
      SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Adolescence is a developmental period marked by steep
      increases in risk-taking behavior coupled with dramatic brain changes. Although
      theories propose that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may influence adolescent risk
      taking, the specific ways in which it functions remain unclear. We report the
      first longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging study to examine how
      neural activation during risk taking changes over time and contributes to
      adolescents' real-life risk-taking behavior. We find that longitudinal declines
      in activation of the ventrolateral PFC are linked to declines in adolescent risk 
      taking, whereas the medial PFC influences adolescent risk taking via its
      functional neural coupling with reward-related regions. This is the first study
      to identify the mechanism by which different regions of the PFC disparately
      contribute to declines in risk taking.

TI  - Earlier adolescent substance use onset predicts stronger connectivity between
      reward and cognitive control brain networks.
LID - S1878-9293(15)00067-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.dcn.2015.07.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early adolescent onset of substance use is a robust predictor of
      future substance use disorders. We examined the relation between age of substance
      use initiation and resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the core
      reward processing (nucleus accumbens; NAcc) to cognitive control (prefrontal
      cortex; PFC) brain networks. METHOD: Adolescents in a longitudinal study of
      Mexican-origin youth reported their substance use annually from ages 10 to 16
      years. At age 16, 69 adolescents participated in a resting state functional
      magnetic resonance imaging scan. Seed-based correlational analyses were conducted
      using regions of interest in bilateral NAcc. RESULTS: The earlier that
      adolescents initiated substance use, the stronger the connectivity between
      bilateral NAcc and right dorsolateral PFC, right dorsomedial PFC, right
      pre-supplementary motor area, right inferior parietal lobule, and left medial
      temporal gyrus. DISCUSSION: The regions that demonstrated significant positive
      linear relationships between the number of adolescent years using substances and 
      connectivity with NAcc are nodes in the right frontoparietal network, which is
      central to cognitive control. The coupling of reward and cognitive control
      networks may be a mechanism through which earlier onset of substance use is
      related to brain function over time, a trajectory that may be implicated in
      subsequent substance use disorders.

TI  - The electrophysiological correlates of the working memory subcomponents: evidence
      from high-density EEG and coherence analysis.
AB  - Synchronization between prefrontal (executive) and posterior (association)
      cortices seems a plausible mechanism for temporary maintenance of information.
      However, while EEG studies reported involvement of (pre)frontal midline
      structures in synchronization, functional neuroimaging elucidated the importance 
      of lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in working memory (WM). Verbal and spatial WM 
      rely on lateralized subsystems (phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad,
      respectively), yet only trends for hemispheric dissociation of networks
      supporting rehearsal of verbal and spatial information were identified by EEG. As
      oscillatory activity is WM load dependent, we applied an individually tailored
      submaximal load for verbal (V) and spatial (S) task to enhance synchronization in
      the relevant functional networks. To map these networks, we used high-density EEG
      and coherence analysis. Our results imply that the synchronized activity is
      limited to highly specialized areas that correspond well with the areas
      identified by functional neuroimaging. In both V and S task, two independent
      networks of theta synchronization involving dorsolateral PFC of each hemisphere
      were revealed. In V task, left prefrontal and left parietal areas were
      functionally coupled in gamma frequencies. Theta synchronization thus provides
      the necessary interface for storage and manipulation of information, while
      left-lateralized gamma synchronization could represent the EEG correlate of the
      phonological loop.

TI  - The Neurodynamics of Affect in the Laboratory Predicts Persistence of Real-World 
      Emotional Responses.
PG  - 10503-9
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0569-15.2015 [doi]
AB  - Failure to sustain positive affect over time is a hallmark of depression and
      other psychopathologies, but the mechanisms supporting the ability to sustain
      positive emotional responses are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the
      neural correlates associated with the persistence of positive affect in the real 
      world by conducting two experiments in humans: an fMRI task of reward responses
      and an experience-sampling task measuring emotional responses to a reward
      obtained in the field. The magnitude of DLPFC engagement to rewards administered 
      in the laboratory predicted reactivity of real-world positive emotion following a
      reward administered in the field. Sustained ventral striatum engagement in the
      laboratory positively predicted the duration of real-world positive emotional
      responses. These results suggest that common pathways are associated with the
      unfolding of neural processes over seconds and with the dynamics of emotions
      experienced over minutes. Examining such dynamics may facilitate a better
      understanding of the brain-behavior associations underlying emotion. Significance
      statement: How real-world emotion, experienced over seconds, minutes, and hours, 
      is instantiated in the brain over the course of milliseconds and seconds is
      unknown. We combined a novel, real-world experience-sampling task with fMRI to
      examine how individual differences in real-world emotion, experienced over
      minutes and hours, is subserved by affective neurodynamics of brain activity over
      the course of seconds. When winning money in the real world, individuals
      sustaining positive emotion the longest were those with the most prolonged
      ventral striatal activity. These results suggest that common pathways are
      associated with the unfolding of neural processes over seconds and with the
      dynamics of emotions experienced over minutes. Examining such dynamics may
      facilitate a better understanding of the brain-behavior associations underlying
      emotion.

AB  - The ability to regulate the emotional response to threat is critical to healthy
      emotional function. However, the response to threat varies considerably from
      person-to-person. This variability may be partially explained by differences in
      emotional processes, such as locus of control and affective state, which vary
      across individuals. Although the basic neural circuitry that mediates the
      response to threat has been described, the impact individual differences in
      affective state and locus of control have on that response is not well
      characterized. Understanding how these factors influence the neural response to
      threat would provide new insight into processes that mediate emotional function. 
      Therefore, the present study used a Pavlovian conditioning procedure to
      investigate the influence individual differences in locus of control, positive
      affect, and negative affect have on the brain and behavioral responses to
      predictable and unpredictable threats. Thirty-two healthy volunteers participated
      in a fear conditioning study in which predictable and unpredictable threats
      (i.e., unconditioned stimulus) were presented during functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI). Locus of control showed a linear relationship with
      learning-related ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity such that the more
      external an individual's locus of control, the greater their differential
      response to predictable versus unpredictable threat. In addition, positive and
      negative affectivity showed a curvilinear relationship with dorsolateral PFC,
      dorsomedial PFC, and insula activity, such that those with high or low
      affectivity showed reduced regional activity compared to those with an
      intermediate level of affectivity. Further, activity within the PFC, as well as
      other regions including the amygdala, were linked with the peripheral emotional
      response as indexed by skin conductance and electromyography. The current
      findings demonstrate that the neural response to threat within brain regions that
      mediate the peripheral emotional response is modulated by an individual's
      affective state as well as their perceptions of an event's causality.

AB  - Previous work in animals has shown that dopamine (DA) in cortex and striatum
      plays an essential role in stress processing. For the first time, we
      systematically reviewed the in vivo evidence for DAergic stress processing in
      health and psychopathology in humans. All studies included (n studies=25, n
      observations=324) utilized DA D2/3 positron emission tomography and measured
      DAergic activity during an acute stress challenge. The evidence in healthy
      volunteers (HV) suggests that physiological, but not psychological, stress
      consistently increases striatal DA release. Instead, increased medial prefrontal 
      cortex (mPFC) DAergic activity in HV was observed during psychological stress.
      Across brain regions, stress-related DAergic activity was correlated with the
      physiological and psychological intensity of the stressor. The magnitude of
      stress-induced DA release was dependent on rearing conditions, personality traits
      and genetic variations in several SNPs. In psychopathology, preliminary evidence 
      was found for stress-related dorsal striatal DAergic hyperactivity in psychosis
      spectrum and a blunted response in chronic cannabis use and pain-related
      disorders, but results were inconsistent. Physiological stress-induced DAergic
      activity in striatum in HV may reflect somatosensory properties of the stressor
      and readiness for active fight-or-flight behavior. DAergic activity in HV in the 
      ventral striatum and mPFC may be more related to expectations about the stressor 
      and threat evaluation, respectively. Future studies with increased sample size in
      HV and psychopathology assessing the functional relevance of stress-induced
      DAergic activity, the association between cortical and subcortical DAergic
      activity and the direct comparison of different stressors are necessary to
      conclusively elucidate the role of the DA system in the stress response.

TI  - Acute ketamine challenge increases resting state prefrontal-hippocampal
      connectivity in both humans and rats.

AB  - RATIONALE: Aberrant prefrontal-hippocampal (PFC-HC) connectivity is disrupted in 
      several psychiatric and at-risk conditions. Advances in rodent functional imaging
      have opened the possibility that this phenotype could serve as a translational
      imaging marker for psychiatric research. Recent evidence from functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) studies has indicated an increase in PFC-HC coupling
      during working-memory tasks in both schizophrenic patients and at-risk
      populations, in contrast to a decrease in resting-state PFC-HC connectivity.
      Acute ketamine challenge is widely used in both humans and rats as a
      pharmacological model to study the mechanisms of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
      receptor hypofunction in the context of psychiatric disorders. OBJECTIVES: We
      aimed to establish whether acute ketamine challenge has consistent effects in
      rats and humans by investigating resting-state fMRI PFC-HC connectivity and thus 
      to corroborate its potential utility as a translational probe. METHODS:
      Twenty-four healthy human subjects (12 females, mean age 25 years) received
      intravenous doses of either saline (placebo) or ketamine (0.5 mg/kg body weight).
      Eighteen Sprague-Dawley male rats received either saline or ketamine (25 mg/kg). 
      Resting-state fMRI measurements took place after injections, and the data were
      analyzed for PFC-HC functional connectivity. RESULTS: In both species, ketamine
      induced a robust increase in PFC-HC coupling, in contrast to findings in chronic 
      schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: This translational comparison demonstrates a
      cross-species consistency in pharmacological effect and elucidates
      ketamine-induced alterations in PFC-HC coupling, a phenotype often disrupted in
      pathological conditions, which may give clue to understanding of psychiatric
      disorders and their onset, and help in the development of new treatments.

      ultra-high field.
PG  - 4076-88
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22899 [doi]
AB  - The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a portion of the "extended
      amygdala," is implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety and addiction
      disorders. Its small size and connection to other small regions prevents standard
      imaging techniques from easily capturing it and its connectivity with confidence.
      Seed-based resting state functional connectivity is an established method for
      mapping functional connections across the brain from a region of interest. We,
      therefore, mapped the BNST resting state network with high spatial resolution
      using 7 Tesla fMRI, demonstrating the in vivo reproduction of many human BNST
      connections previously described only in animal research. We identify strong BNST
      functional connectivity in amygdala, hippocampus and thalamic subregions,
      caudate, periaqueductal gray, hypothalamus, and cortical areas such as the medial
      PFC and precuneus. This work, which demonstrates the power of ultra-high field
      for mapping functional connections in the human, is an important step toward
      elucidating cortical and subcortical regions and subregions of the BNST network.

TI  - Association of serum VEGF levels with prefrontal cortex volume in schizophrenia.
LID - 10.1038/mp.2015.96 [doi]
AB  - A large body of evidence indicates alterations in brain regional cellular energy 
      metabolism and blood flow in schizophrenia. Among the different molecules
      regulating blood flow, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is generally
      accepted as the major factor involved in the process of angiogenesis. In the
      present study, we examined whether peripheral VEGF levels correlate with changes 
      in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) volume in patients with schizophrenia and in
      healthy controls. Whole-blood samples were obtained from 96 people with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 83 healthy controls. Serum VEGF
      protein levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas
      quantitative PCR was performed to measure interleukin-6 (IL-6, a pro-inflammatory
      marker implicated in schizophrenia) mRNA levels in the blood samples. Structural 
      magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained using a 3T Achieva scanner on a
      subset of 59 people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 65 healthy
      controls, and prefrontal volumes were obtained using FreeSurfer software. As
      compared with healthy controls, individuals with schizophrenia had a significant 
      increase in log-transformed mean serum VEGF levels (t(177)=2.9, P=0.005). A
      significant inverse correlation (r=-0.40, P=0.002) between serum VEGF and total
      frontal pole volume was found in patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective
      disorder. Moreover, we observed a significant positive association (r=0.24,
      P=0.03) between serum VEGF and IL-6 mRNA levels in patients with schizophrenia.
      These findings suggest an association between serum VEGF and inflammation, and
      that serum VEGF levels are related to structural abnormalities in the PFC of
      people with schizophrenia.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 14

TI  - Effects of Increasing Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Current Intensity on
      Cortical Sensorimotor Network Activation: A Time Domain fNIRS Study.
PG  - e0131951
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0131951 [doi]
AB  - Neuroimaging studies have shown neuromuscular electrical stimulation
      (NMES)-evoked movements activate regions of the cortical sensorimotor network,
      including the primary sensorimotor cortex (SMC), premotor cortex (PMC),
      supplementary motor area (SMA), and secondary somatosensory area (S2), as well as
      regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) known to be involved in pain processing.
      The aim of this study, on nine healthy subjects, was to compare the cortical
      network activation profile and pain ratings during NMES of the right forearm
      wrist extensor muscles at increasing current intensities up to and slightly over 
      the individual maximal tolerated intensity (MTI), and with reference to voluntary
      (VOL) wrist extension movements. By exploiting the capability of the
      multi-channel time domain functional near-infrared spectroscopy technique to
      relate depth information to the photon time-of-flight, the cortical and
      superficial oxygenated (O2Hb) and deoxygenated (HHb) hemoglobin concentrations
      were estimated. The O2Hb and HHb maps obtained using the General Linear Model
      (NIRS-SPM) analysis method, showed that the VOL and NMES-evoked movements
      significantly increased activation (i.e., increase in O2Hb and corresponding
      decrease in HHb) in the cortical layer of the contralateral sensorimotor network 
      (SMC, PMC/SMA, and S2). However, the level and area of contralateral sensorimotor
      network (including PFC) activation was significantly greater for NMES than VOL.
      Furthermore, there was greater bilateral sensorimotor network activation with the
      high NMES current intensities which corresponded with increased pain ratings. In 
      conclusion, our findings suggest that greater bilateral sensorimotor network
      activation profile with high NMES current intensities could be in part
      attributable to increased attentional/pain processing and to increased bilateral 
      sensorimotor integration in these cortical regions.

AB  - Stress resilience is mediated, in part, by our ability to predict and control
      threats within our environment. Therefore, determining the neural mechanisms that
      regulate the emotional response to predictable and controllable threats may
      provide important new insight into the processes that mediate resilience to
      emotional dysfunction and guide the future development of interventions for
      anxiety disorders. To better understand the effect of predictability and
      controllability on threat-related brain activity in humans, two groups of healthy
      volunteers participated in a yoked Pavlovian fear conditioning study during
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Threat predictability was
      manipulated by presenting an aversive unconditioned stimulus (UCS) that was
      either preceded by a conditioned stimulus (i.e., predictable) or by presenting
      the UCS alone (i.e., unpredictable). Similar to animal model research that has
      employed yoked fear conditioning procedures, one group (controllable condition;
      CC), but not the other group (uncontrollable condition; UC) was able to terminate
      the UCS. The fMRI signal response within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (PFC), dorsomedial PFC, ventromedial PFC, and posterior cingulate was diminished 
      during predictable compared to unpredictable threat (i.e., UCS). In addition,
      threat-related activity within the ventromedial PFC and bilateral hippocampus was
      diminished only to threats that were both predictable and controllable. These
      findings provide insight into how threat predictability and controllability
      affects the activity of brain regions (i.e., ventromedial PFC and hippocampus)
      involved in emotion regulation, and may have important implications for better
      understanding neural processes that mediate emotional resilience to stress.

TI  - Prefrontal and Striatal Glutamate Differently Relate to Striatal Dopamine:
      Potential Regulatory Mechanisms of Striatal Presynaptic Dopamine Function?
PG  - 9615-21
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0329-15.2015 [doi]
AB  - Theoretical and animal work has proposed that prefrontal cortex (PFC) glutamate
      inhibits dopaminergic inputs to the ventral striatum (VS) indirectly, whereas
      direct VS glutamatergic afferents have been suggested to enhance dopaminergic
      inputs to the VS. In the present study, we aimed to investigate relationships of 
      glutamate and dopamine measures in prefrontostriatal circuitries of healthy
      humans. We hypothesized that PFC and VS glutamate, as well as their balance, are 
      differently associated with VS dopamine. Glutamate concentrations in the left
      lateral PFC and left striatum were assessed using 3-Tesla proton magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy. Striatal presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity was
      measured by fluorine-18-l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (F-18-FDOPA) positron emission
      tomography. First, a negative relationship was observed between glutamate
      concentrations in lateral PFC and VS dopamine synthesis capacity (n = 28).
      Second, a positive relationship was revealed between striatal glutamate and VS
      dopamine synthesis capacity (n = 26). Additionally, the intraindividual
      difference between PFC and striatal glutamate concentrations correlated
      negatively with VS dopamine synthesis capacity (n = 24). The present results
      indicate an involvement of a balance in PFC and striatal glutamate in the
      regulation of VS dopamine synthesis capacity. This notion points toward a
      potential mechanism how VS presynaptic dopamine levels are kept in a fine-tuned
      range. A disruption of this mechanism may account for alterations in striatal
      dopamine turnover as observed in mental diseases (e.g., in schizophrenia).
      SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The present work demonstrates complementary relationships
      between prefrontal and striatal glutamate and ventral striatal presynaptic
      dopamine using human imaging measures: a negative correlation between prefrontal 
      glutamate and presynaptic dopamine and a positive relationship between striatal
      glutamate and presynaptic dopamine are revealed. The results may reflect a
      regulatory role of prefrontal and striatal glutamate for ventral striatal
      presynaptic dopamine levels. Such glutamate-dopamine relationships improve our
      understanding of neurochemical interactions in prefrontostriatal circuits and
      have implications for the neurobiology of mental disease.

TI  - Dynamically Allocated Hub in Task-Evoked Network Predicts the Vulnerable
      Prefrontal Locus for Contextual Memory Retrieval in Macaques.
PG  - e1002177
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002177 [doi]
AB  - Neuroimaging and neurophysiology have revealed that multiple areas in the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) are activated in a specific memory task, but severity of 
      impairment after PFC lesions is largely different depending on which activated
      area is damaged. The critical relationship between lesion sites and impairments
      has not yet been given a clear mechanistic explanation. Although recent works
      proposed that a whole-brain network contains hubs that play integrative roles in 
      cortical information processing, this framework relying on an anatomy-based
      structural network cannot account for the vulnerable locus for a specific task,
      lesioning of which would bring impairment. Here, we hypothesized that (i)
      activated PFC areas dynamically form an ordered network centered at a
      task-specific "functional hub" and (ii) the lesion-effective site corresponds to 
      the "functional hub," but not to a task-invariant "structural hub." To test these
      hypotheses, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments in
      macaques performing a temporal contextual memory task. We found that the
      activated areas formed a hierarchical hub-centric network based on task-evoked
      directed connectivity, differently from the anatomical network reflecting axonal 
      projection patterns. Using a novel simulated-lesion method based on support
      vector machine, we estimated severity of impairment after lesioning of each area,
      which accorded well with a known dissociation in contextual memory impairment in 
      macaques (impairment after lesioning in area 9/46d, but not in area 8Ad). The
      predicted severity of impairment was proportional to the network "hubness" of the
      virtually lesioned area in the task-evoked directed connectivity network, rather 
      than in the anatomical network known from tracer studies. Our results suggest
      that PFC areas dynamically and cooperatively shape a functional hub-centric
      network to reallocate the lesion-effective site depending on the cognitive
      processes, apart from static anatomical hubs. These findings will be a foundation
      for precise prediction of behavioral impacts of damage or surgical intervention
      in human brains.

      tomography: Implications for the stimulant paradigm.

LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.06.057 [doi]
AB  - Experimental tasks and stimulant paradigms in combination with D2/3 emission
      tomography have been essential in understanding the dopamine (DA) system.
      However, whereas task-induced DA release is dependent on a mechanism that is
      largely similar throughout the brain, the DA-increasing stimulant mechanism of
      action changes drastically from striatum to cortex. We posit the problems that
      may be encountered when translating the stimulant emission tomography paradigm
      from striatum to PFC. After comparing the available human data on task- and
      stimulant-induced changes in extracellular PFC DA assessed with PET, we
      hypothesize that the stimulant paradigm in the PFC, even with high affinity
      tracers, may not completely capture the true effect of stimulants on
      extracellular PFC DA levels. Task-induced and stimulant-induced effects on
      extracellular PFC DA measured with emission tomography should therefore be
      regarded as different phenomena. We conclude with future directions and
      alternative probes to measure PFC DA transmission with emission tomography.

      and Predictors of Change.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-a chronic, debilitating condition, broadly
      characterized by emotion dysregulation-is prevalent among US military personnel
      who have returned from Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Iraqi Freedom (OIF).
      Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a first-line treatment for
      PTSD, but treatment mechanisms are unknown and patient response varies. SSRIs may
      exert their effects by remediating emotion regulatory brain activity and
      individual differences in patient response might be explained, in part, by
      pre-treatment differences in neural systems supporting the downregulation of
      negative affect. Thirty-four OEF/OIF veterans, 17 with PTSD and 17 without PTSD
      underwent 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging scans 12 weeks apart. At each
      scan, they performed an emotion regulation task; in the interim, veterans with
      PTSD were treated with the SSRI, paroxetine. SSRI treatment increased activation 
      in both the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and supplementary motor
      area (SMA) during emotion regulation, although only change in the SMA over time
      occurred in veterans with PTSD and not those without PTSD. Less activation of the
      right ventrolateral PFC/inferior frontal gyrus during pre-treatment emotion
      regulation was associated with greater reduction in PTSD symptoms with SSRI
      treatment, irrespective of pre-treatment severity. Patients with the least
      recruitment of prefrontal emotion regulatory brain regions may benefit most from 
      treatment with SSRIs, which appear to augment activity in these
      regions.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 5 August 2015;

AB  - Functional, molecular and genetic neuroimaging has highlighted the existence of
      brain anomalies and neural vulnerability factors related to obesity and eating
      disorders such as binge eating or anorexia nervosa. In particular, decreased
      basal metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and striatum as well as dopaminergic
      alterations have been described in obese subjects, in parallel with increased
      activation of reward brain areas in response to palatable food cues. Elevated
      reward region responsivity may trigger food craving and predict future weight
      gain. This opens the way to prevention studies using functional and molecular
      neuroimaging to perform early diagnostics and to phenotype subjects at risk by
      exploring different neurobehavioral dimensions of the food choices and motivation
      processes. In the first part of this review, advantages and limitations of
      neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
      positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT), pharmacogenetic fMRI and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
      will be discussed in the context of recent work dealing with eating behavior,
      with a particular focus on obesity. In the second part of the review,
      non-invasive strategies to modulate food-related brain processes and functions
      will be presented. At the leading edge of non-invasive brain-based technologies
      is real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback, which is a powerful tool to better
      understand the complexity of human brain-behavior relationships. rtfMRI, alone or
      when combined with other techniques and tools such as EEG and cognitive therapy, 
      could be used to alter neural plasticity and learned behavior to optimize and/or 
      restore healthy cognition and eating behavior. Other promising non-invasive
      neuromodulation approaches being explored are repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS). Converging
      evidence points at the value of these non-invasive neuromodulation strategies to 
      study basic mechanisms underlying eating behavior and to treat its disorders.
      Both of these approaches will be compared in light of recent work in this field, 
      while addressing technical and practical questions. The third part of this review
      will be dedicated to invasive neuromodulation strategies, such as vagus nerve
      stimulation (VNS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS). In combination with
      neuroimaging approaches, these techniques are promising experimental tools to
      unravel the intricate relationships between homeostatic and hedonic brain
      circuits. Their potential as additional therapeutic tools to combat
      pharmacorefractory morbid obesity or acute eating disorders will be discussed, in
      terms of technical challenges, applicability and ethics. In a general discussion,
      we will put the brain at the core of fundamental research, prevention and therapy
      in the context of obesity and eating disorders. First, we will discuss the
      possibility to identify new biological markers of brain functions. Second, we
      will highlight the potential of neuroimaging and neuromodulation in
      individualized medicine. Third, we will introduce the ethical questions that are 
      concomitant to the emergence of new neuromodulation therapies.

AB  - Patients with long-term remission of Cushing's disease (CD) demonstrate residual 
      psychological complaints. At present, it is not known how previous exposure to
      hypercortisolism affects psychological functioning in the long-term. Earlier
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies demonstrated abnormalities of brain
      structure and resting-state connectivity in patients with long-term remission of 
      CD, but no data are available on functional alterations in the brain during the
      performance of emotional or cognitive tasks in these patients. We performed a
      cross-sectional functional MRI study, investigating brain activation during
      emotion processing in patients with long-term remission of CD. Processing of
      emotional faces versus a non-emotional control condition was examined in 21
      patients and 21 matched healthy controls. Analyses focused on activation and
      connectivity of two a priori determined regions of interest: the amygdala and the
      medial prefrontal-orbitofrontal cortex (mPFC-OFC). We also assessed psychological
      functioning, cognitive failure, and clinical disease severity. Patients showed
      less mPFC activation during processing of emotional faces compared to controls,
      whereas no differences were found in amygdala activation. An exploratory
      psychophysiological interaction analysis demonstrated decreased functional
      coupling between the ventromedial PFC and posterior cingulate cortex (a region
      structurally connected to the PFC) in CD-patients. The present study is the first
      to show alterations in brain function and task-related functional coupling in
      patients with long-term remission of CD relative to matched healthy controls.
      These alterations may, together with abnormalities in brain structure, be related
      to the persisting psychological morbidity in patients with CD after long-term
      remission.

AB  - To study rapid sensorimotor remapping, we developed a method to train rats in a
      behavior in which subjects are cued, on each trial, to apply a sensorimotor
      association to orient either toward a visual target ("Pro") or away from it,
      toward its reverse ("Anti"). Multiple behavioral asymmetries suggested that Anti 
      behavior is cognitively demanding while Pro is easier to learn and perform. This 
      is consistent with a prominent hypothesis in the primate literature that Anti
      requires prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas Pro could be mediated by midbrain
      superior colliculus (SC). Pharmacological inactivation of rat medial PFC
      supported its expected role in Anti. Remarkably, bilateral SC inactivation
      substantially impaired Anti while leaving Pro essentially intact. Moreover, SC
      inactivation eliminated the performance cost of switching from Anti to Pro tasks.
      Our results establish a rodent model of single-trial sensorimotor remapping and
      suggest a critical role for SC in the cognitively demanding Anti task.

TI  - Maintaining Gait Performance by Cortical Activation during Dual-Task
      Interference: A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Study.

AB  - In daily life, mobility requires walking while performing a cognitive or
      upper-extremity motor task. Although previous studies have evaluated the effects 
      of dual tasks on gait performance, few studies have evaluated cortical activation
      and its association with gait disturbance during dual tasks. In this study, we
      simultaneously assessed gait performance and cerebral oxygenation in the
      bilateral prefrontal cortices (PFC), premotor cortices (PMC), and supplemental
      motor areas (SMA), using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, in 17 young
      adults performing dual tasks. Each participant was evaluated while performing
      normal-pace walking (NW), walking while performing a cognitive task (WCT), and
      walking while performing a motor task (WMT). Our results indicated that the left 
      PFC exhibited the strongest and most sustained activation during WCT, and that NW
      and WMT were associated with minor increases in oxygenation levels during their
      initial phases. We observed increased activation in channels in the SMA and PMC
      during WCT and WMT. Gait data indicated that WCT and WMT both caused reductions
      in walking speed, but these reductions resulted from differing alterations in
      gait properties. WCT was associated with significant changes in cadence, stride
      time, and stride length, whereas WMT was associated with reductions in stride
      length only. During dual-task activities, increased activation of the PMC and SMA
      correlated with declines in gait performance, indicating a control mechanism for 
      maintaining gait performance during dual tasks. Thus, the regulatory effects of
      cortical activation on gait behavior enable a second task to be performed while
      walking.

AB  - The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) relates to basic neuronal functions,
      such as cell survival, axonal outgrowth, and dendritic growth. The Val66Met
      polymorphism of the BDNF gene may affect genetic susceptibility to major
      depressive disorder (MDD). We prospectively investigated the relationship between
      the Val66Met BDNF genotype and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) findings for first
      episode and drug-naive MDD patients and healthy subjects (HS). Participants
      comprised 38 MDD patients and 42 age- and sex-matched HS were divided into groups
      based on their BDNF genotype. The effects of diagnosis and genotype, as well as
      the genotype-diagnosis interaction, in relation to brain morphology were
      evaluated using a voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis of high-resolution magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Among the Met-carriers, the volume of the left 
      middle frontal gyrus (composition of the prefrontal cortex [PFC]) was
      significantly smaller for MDD patients than for the HS, i.e., there was a
      significant genotype-diagnosis interaction effect on brain morphology noted in
      the left PFC. The BDNF polymorphism was associated with atrophy of the PFC in MDD
      patients, which suggests that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may play an
      important role in the pathogenesis of early stages of MDD.

AB  - Panic disorder has been associated with dysfunctional neuropsychological
      dimensions, including anxiety sensitivity. Brain-imaging studies of the neural
      correlates of emotional processing have identified a network of structures that
      constitute the neural circuitry for emotions. The anterior cingulate cortex
      (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and insula, which are part of this
      network, are also involved in the processing of threat-related stimuli. The aim
      of the study was to investigate if neural activity in response to emotional
      stimuli in the cortico-limbic network is associated to anxiety sensitivity in
      panic disorder. In a sample of 18 outpatients with panic disorder, we studied
      neural correlates of implicit emotional processing of facial affect expressions
      with a face-matching paradigm; correlational analyses were performed between
      brain activations and anxiety sensitivity. The correlational analyses performed
      showed a positive correlation between anxiety sensitivity and brain activity
      during emotional processing in regions encompassing the PFC, ACC and insula. Our 
      data seem to confirm that anxiety sensitivity is an important component of panic 
      disorder. Accordingly, the neural underpinnings of anxiety sensitivity could be
      an interesting focus for treatment and further research.

TI  - The relationship between exercise intensity, cerebral oxygenation and cognitive

PG  - 2189-97

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between exercise intensity, cerebral HbO2 and
      cognitive performance (Executive and non-Executive) in young adults. METHODS: We 
      measured reaction time (RT) and accuracy, during a computerized Stroop task, in
      19 young adults (7 males and 12 females). Their mean +/- SD age, height, body
      mass and body mass index (BMI) were 24 +/- 4 years, 1.67 +/- 0.07 m, 72 +/- 14 kg
      and 25 +/- 3 kg m(-2), respectively. Each subject performed the Stroop task at
      rest and during cycling at exercise of low intensity [40 % of peak power output
      (PPO)], moderate intensity (60 % of PPO) and high intensity (85 % of PPO).
      Cerebral oxygenation was monitored during the resting and exercise conditions
      over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
      RESULTS: High-intensity exercise slowed RT in both the Naming (p = 0.04) and the 
      Executive condition (p = 0.04). The analysis also revealed that high-intensity
      exercise was associated with a decreased accuracy when compared to low-intensity 
      exercise (p = 0.021). Neuroimaging results confirm a decrease of cerebral
      oxygenation during high-intensity exercise in comparison to low- (p = 0.004) and 
      moderate-intensity exercise (p = 0.003). Correlations revealed that a lower
      cerebral HbO2 in the prefrontal cortex was associated with slower RT in the
      Executive condition only (p = 0.04, g = -0.72). CONCLUSION: Results of the
      present study suggest that low to moderate exercise intensity does not alter
      Executive functioning, but that exercise impairs cognitive functions (Executive
      and non-Executive) when the physical workload becomes heavy. The cerebral HbO2
      correlation suggests that a lower availability of HbO2 was associated with slower
      RT in the Executive condition only.

TI  - Risk-Taking Behavior in a Computerized Driving Task: Brain Activation Correlates 
      of Decision-Making, Outcome, and Peer Influence in Male Adolescents.
PG  - e0129516
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0129516 [doi]
AB  - Increased propensity for risky behavior in adolescents, particularly in peer
      groups, is thought to reflect maturational imbalance between reward processing
      and cognitive control systems that affect decision-making. We used functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain functional correlates of
      risk-taking behavior and effects of peer influence in 18-19-year-old male
      adolescents. The subjects were divided into low and high risk-taking groups using
      either personality tests or risk-taking rates in a simulated driving task. The
      fMRI data were analyzed for decision-making (whether to take a risk at
      intersections) and outcome (pass or crash) phases, and for the influence of peer 
      competition. Personality test-based groups showed no difference in the amount of 
      risk-taking (similarly increased during peer competition) and brain activation.
      When groups were defined by actual task performance, risk-taking activated two
      areas in the left medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) significantly more in low than
      in high risk-takers. In the entire sample, risky decision-specific activation was
      found in the anterior and dorsal cingulate, superior parietal cortex, basal
      ganglia (including the nucleus accumbens), midbrain, thalamus, and hypothalamus. 
      Peer competition increased outcome-related activation in the right caudate head
      and cerebellar vermis in the entire sample. Our results suggest that the
      activation of the medial (rather than lateral) PFC and striatum is most specific 
      to risk-taking behavior of male adolescents in a simulated driving situation, and
      reflect a stronger conflict and thus increased cognitive effort to take risks in 
      low risk-takers, and reward anticipation for risky decisions, respectively. The
      activation of the caudate nucleus, particularly for the positive outcome (pass)
      during peer competition, further suggests enhanced reward processing of
      risk-taking under peer influence.

TI  - Anhedonia in combat veterans with penetrating head injury.
PG  - 456-60
LID - 10.1007/s11682-015-9414-4 [doi]
AB  - Anhedonia is a common symptom following traumatic brain injury. The neural basis 
      of anhedonia is poorly understood, but believed to involve disturbed reward
      processing, rather than the loss of sense of pleasure. This analysis was
      undertaken to determine if injury to specific regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
      result in anhedonia. A CT-based lesion analysis was undertaken in 192
      participants of the Vietnam Head Injury Study, most with penetrating head injury.
      Participants were divided into left and right ventrolateral prefrontal, bilateral
      ventromedial prefrontal, and other injury locations. Anhedonia was measured by
      self-report in each group using the four-item anhedonia subscale score of the
      Beck Depression Inventory-II. Individuals with right ventrolateral injury
      reported greater severity of anhedonia compared to those with injury in the left 
      ventrolateral region. These findings support an association between injury in the
      right ventrolateral PFC and anhedonia.

TI  - Neural and Behavioral Correlates of Alcohol-Induced Aggression Under Provocation.
LID - 10.1038/npp.2015.141 [doi]
AB  - Although alcohol consumption is linked to increased aggression, its neural
      correlates have not directly been studied in humans so far. Based on a
      comprehensive neurobiological model of alcohol-induced aggression, we
      hypothesized that alcohol-induced aggression would go along with increased
      amygdala and ventral striatum reactivity and impaired functioning of the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) under alcohol. We measured neural and behavioral
      correlates of alcohol-induced aggression in a provoking vs non-provoking
      condition with a variant of the Taylor aggression paradigm (TAP) allowing to
      differentiate between reactive (provoked) and proactive (unprovoked) aggression. 
      In a placebo-controlled cross-over design with moderate alcohol intoxication
      (~0.6 g/kg), 35 young healthy adults performed the TAP during functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI). Analyses revealed that provoking vs non-provoking
      conditions and alcohol vs placebo increased aggression and decreased brain
      responses in the anterior cingulate cortex/dorso-medial PFC
      (provoking<non-provoking) and the ventral striatum (alcohol<placebo) across our
      healthy sample. Interestingly, alcohol specifically increased proactive
      (unprovoked) but not reactive (provoked) aggression (alcohol x provocation
      interaction). However, investigation of inter-individual differences revealed (1)
      that pronounced alcohol-induced proactive aggression was linked to higher levels 
      of aggression under placebo, and (2) that pronounced alcohol-induced reactive
      aggression was related to increased amygdala and ventral striatum reactivity
      under alcohol, providing evidence for their role in human alcohol-induced
      reactive aggression. Our findings suggest that in healthy young adults a
      liability for alcohol-induced aggression in a non-provoking context might depend 
      on overall high levels of aggression, but on alcohol-induced increased striatal
      and amygdala reactivity when triggered by provocation.Neuropsychopharmacology

      substance use disorders.
PG  - 219
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00219 [doi]
AB  - We aimed to uncover differences in brain circuits of adolescents with parental
      positive or negative histories of substance use disorders (SUD), when performing 
      a task that elicits emotional conflict, testing whether the brain circuits could 
      serve as endophenotype markers to distinguish these adolescents. We acquired
      functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 11 adolescents with a positive
      familial history of SUD (FH+ group) and seven adolescents with a negative
      familial history of SUD (FH- group) when performing an emotional stroop task. We 
      extracted brain features from the conflict-related contrast images in group level
      analyses and granger causality indices (GCIs) that measure the causal
      interactions among regions. Support vector machine (SVM) was applied to classify 
      the FH+ and FH- adolescents. Adolescents with FH+ showed greater activity and
      weaker connectivity related to emotional conflict, decision making and reward
      system including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and
      ventral tegmental area (VTA). High classification accuracies were achieved with
      leave-one-out cross validation (89.75% for the maximum conflict, 96.71% when
      combining maximum conflict and general conflict contrast, 97.28% when combining
      activity of the two contrasts and GCIs). Individual contributions of the brain
      features to the classification were further investigated, indicating that
      activation in PFC, ACC, VTA and effective connectivity from PFC to ACC play the
      most important roles. We concluded that fundamental differences of neural
      substrates underlying cognitive behaviors of adolescents with parental positive
      or negative histories of SUD provide new insight into potential neurobiological
      mechanisms contributing to the elevated risk of FH+ individuals for developing
      SUD.

PG  - 7030-40
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2371-14.2015 [doi]
AB  - Complex audio-vocal integration systems depend on a strong interconnection
      between the auditory and the vocal motor system. To gain cognitive control over
      audio-vocal interaction during vocal motor control, the PFC needs to be involved.
      Neurons in the ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) have been shown to separately encode the
      sensory perceptions and motor production of vocalizations. It is unknown,
      however, whether single neurons in the PFC reflect audio-vocal interactions. We
      therefore recorded single-unit activity in the VLPFC of rhesus monkeys (Macaca
      mulatta) while they produced vocalizations on command or passively listened to
      monkey calls. We found that 12% of randomly selected neurons in VLPFC modulated
      their discharge rate in response to acoustic stimulation with species-specific
      calls. Almost three-fourths of these auditory neurons showed an additional
      modulation of their discharge rates either before and/or during the monkeys'
      motor production of vocalization. Based on these audio-vocal interactions, the
      VLPFC might be well positioned to combine higher order auditory processing with
      cognitive control of the vocal motor output. Such audio-vocal integration
      processes in the VLPFC might constitute a precursor for the evolution of complex 
      learned audio-vocal integration systems, ultimately giving rise to human speech.

AB  - While schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have been assumed to share phenotypic
      and genotypic features, there is also evidence for overlapping brain structural
      correlates, although it is unclear whether these relate to shared psychotic
      features. In this study, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM8) in 34
      schizophrenia patients, 17 euthymic bipolar I disorder patients (with a history
      of psychotic symptoms), and 34 healthy controls. Our results indicate that
      compared to healthy controls schizophrenia patients show grey matter deficits
      (p<0.05, FDR corrected) in medial and right dorsolateral prefrontal, as well as
      bilaterally in ventrolateral prefrontal and insular cortical areas, thalamus
      (bilaterally), left superior temporal cortex, and minor medial parietal and
      parietooccipital areas. Comparing schizophrenia vs. bipolar I patients (p<0.05,
      FDR corrected) yielded a similar pattern, however, there was an additional
      significant reduction in schizophrenia patients in the (posterior) hippocampus
      bilaterally, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left cerebellum. Compared
      to healthy controls, the deficits in bipolar I patients only reached significance
      at p<0.001 (uncorr.) for a minor parietal cluster, but not for prefrontal areas. 
      Our results suggest that the more extensive prefrontal, thalamic, and hippocampal
      deficits that might set apart schizophrenia and bipolar disorder might not be
      related to mere appearance of psychotic symptoms at some stage of the disorders.

TI  - Brain Rewarding Stimulation Reduces Extracellular Glutamate Through Glial
      Modulation in Medial Prefrontal Cortex of Rats.
PG  - 2686-95
LID - 10.1038/npp.2015.115 [doi]
AB  - Growing evidence implicates a critical involvement of prefrontal glial modulation
      of extracellular glutamate (GLU) in aversive behaviors. However, nothing is known
      about whether prefrontal glial cells modulate GLU levels in rewarding behaviors. 
      To address this question, we measured GLU efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex 
      (PFC) of rats associated with rewarding behaviors. We used intracranial
      self-stimulation (ICSS) of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) as the rewarding
      behavior. GLU was indirectly measured using microdialysis combined with on-line
      fluorometric detection of NADH resulting from the reaction of GLU and NAD(+)
      catalyzed by GLU dehydrogenase with a time resolution of 1 min. ICSS caused a
      minute-by-minute change of extracellular GLU in the medial PFC, with a slight
      decrease during the stimulation, followed by an increase afterward. This
      bidirectional change was tetrodotoxin insensitive and abolished by the gliotoxin 
      fluorocitrate. To confirm and extend the previous studies of aversion-induced
      increase of extracellular GLU in the medial PFC, we also measured prefrontal GLU 
      efflux associated with an aversive stimulation, immobilization stress. The
      temporal change in extracellular GLU caused by this stress was markedly different
      from that observed during ICSS. A rapid increase in GLU was detected during the
      aversive stimulation, followed by a large increase afterward. This bimodal change
      was tetrodotoxin insensitive, similar to that detected for ICSS. These findings
      indicate a bidirectional regulation of extracellular GLU by prefrontal glial
      cells associated with rat ICSS behavior, and reveal that glial modulation of GLU 
      neurochemistry in the medial PFC contributes to rewarding as well as aversive
      behaviors in rats.

AB  - RATIONALE: Chronic marijuana (MJ) use among adolescents has been associated with 
      structural and functional abnormalities, particularly in developing regions
      responsible for higher order cognition. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated
      prefrontal (PFC) and parietal volumes and executive function in emerging adult MJ
      users and explored potential gender differences. METHODS: Participants (ages
      18-25) were 27 MJ users and 32 controls without neurologic or psychiatric
      disorders or heavy other drug use. A series of multiple regressions examined
      whether group status, past year MJ use, and their interactions with gender
      predicted ROI volumes. Post hoc analyses consisted of brain-behavior correlations
      between volumes and cognitive variables and Fisher's z tests to assess group
      differences. RESULTS: MJ users demonstrated significantly smaller medial
      orbitofrontal (mOFC; p = 0.004, FDR p = 0.024) and inferior parietal volumes (p =
      0.04, FDR p = 0.12); follow-up regressions found that increased past year MJ use 
      did not significantly dose-dependently predict smaller mOFC volume in a
      sub-sample of individuals with at least one past year MJ use. There were no
      significant gender interactions. There was a significant brain-behavior
      difference by group, such that smaller mOFC volumes were associated with poorer
      complex attention for MJ users (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Smaller mOFC volumes
      among MJ users suggest disruption of typical neurodevelopmental processes
      associated with regular MJ use for both genders. These results highlight the need
      for longitudinal, multi-modal imaging studies providing clearer information on
      timing of neurodevelopmental processes and neurocognitive impacts of youth MJ
      initiation.

TI  - Neurogenetic and epigenetic correlates of adolescent predisposition to and risk
      for addictive behaviors as a function of prefrontal cortex dysregulation.
PG  - 286-92
LID - 10.1089/cap.2014.0146 [doi]
AB  - As addiction professionals, we are becoming increasingly concerned about
      preteenagers and young adults' involvement with substance abuse as a way of
      relieving stress and anger. The turbulent underdeveloped central nervous system, 
      especially in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), provides impetus to not only continue 
      important neuroimaging studies in both human and animal models, but also to
      encourage preventive measures and cautions embraced by governmental and social
      media outlets. It is well known that before people reach their 20s, PFC
      development is undergoing significant changes and, as such, hijacks appropriate
      decision making in this population. We are further proposing that early genetic
      testing for addiction risk alleles will offer important information that could
      potentially be utilized by their parents and caregivers prior to use of
      psychoactive drugs by these youth. Understandably, family history, parenting
      styles, and attachment may be modified by various reward genes, including the
      known bonding substances oxytocin/vasopressin, which effect dopaminergic
      function. Well-characterized neuroimaging studies continue to reflect
      region-specific differential responses to drugs and food (including other
      non-substance-addictive behaviors) via either "surfeit" or "deficit." With this
      in mind, we hereby propose a "reward deficiency solution system" that combines
      early genetic risk diagnosis, medical monitoring, and nutrigenomic dopamine
      agonist modalities to combat this significant global dilemma that is preventing
      our youth from leading normal productive lives, which will in turn make them
      happier.

      psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.
PG  - 810548
LID - 10.1155/2015/810548 [doi]
AB  - In rodents, the hippocampus has been studied extensively as part of a brain
      system responsible for learning and memory, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      participates in numerous cognitive functions including working memory,
      flexibility, decision making, and rewarding learning. The neuronal projections
      from the hippocampus, either directly or indirectly, to the PFC, referred to as
      the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex (Hip-PFC) circuit, play a critical role in
      cognitive and emotional regulation and memory consolidation. Although in certain 
      psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, structural connectivity viewed by
      imaging techniques has been consistently found to be associated with clinical
      phenotype and disease severity, the focus has moved towards the investigation of 
      connectivity correlates of molecular pathology and coupling of oscillation.
      Moreover, functional and structural connectivity measures have been emerging as
      potential intermediate biomarkers for neuronal disorders. In this review, we
      summarize progress on the anatomic, molecular, and electrophysiological
      characters of the Hip-PFC circuit in cognition and emotion processes with an
      emphasis on oscillation and functional connectivity, revealing a disrupted
      Hip-PFC connectivity and electrical activity in psychiatric and neurodegenerative
      disorders as a promising candidate of neural marker for neuronal disorders.

TI  - A resting-state functional MRI study on central control of storage: brain
      response provoked by strong desire to void.
PG  - 927-35
LID - 10.1007/s11255-015-0978-0 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: In order to observe central responses during naturally occurring urinary
      bladder storage in healthy subjects, we examined brain areas that control strong 
      bladder sensation by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (rs-fMRI). METHODS: All subjects were right-handed and scanned twice under the
      following two conditions: empty bladder and full bladder ('strong desire to
      void') without the use of filling with a catheter. Brain imaging software (DPARSF
      and REST) was adopted to analyze the difference in brain-blood perfusion between 
      the two conditions. Voxel-based analysis of the regional homogeneity (Reho) maps 
      between empty and full bladder was performed with a paired t test. Statistical
      maps were set at P value <0.05 and were corrected for multiple comparisons.
      RESULTS: The rs-fMRI scans of 30 healthy subjects (8 men and 22 women, between 24
      and 49 years of age) were analyzed. The responses became stronger in the state of
      strong desire to void (P < 0.05). Increased activity during strong desire to void
      was observed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
      hypothalamus, temporal lobes and left caudate nucleus, which are involved in
      bladder perception related to large volumes in adults. CONCLUSIONS: There are
      significant changes in the brain's Reho during the strong sensation to void. The 
      results suggest that the PFC, the ACC, hypothalamus, temporal lobes and left
      caudate nucleus play a role in the cerebral control of bladder storage without
      artificial bladder filling in healthy people.

AB  - The frontostriatal system plays a critical role in emotional and cognitive
      control. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) influences the release of
      dopamine (DA) in the ventral striatum (VST), while catechol-O-methyltransferase
      (COMT) impacts DA availability in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Behavioral studies
      have already shown a genetic interaction of BDNF Val66Met and COMT Val158Met, but
      the interaction on the DA-related neural circuit has not been previously studied.
      Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a sample of healthy 
      human subjects, that BDNF and COMT epistatically interacted on the functional
      connectivity between the bilateral VST and the anterior cingulate cortex.
      Specifically, BDNF Val66Met impacted the VST-PFC functional connectivity in an
      inverted U-shaped in COMT Met carriers, while COMT Val homozygotes displayed a
      U-shaped. These data may be helpful elucidating the mechanism of the interaction 
      between BDNF and COMT on the cognitive functions that are based in the
      frontostriatal system.

TI  - Light therapy and serotonin transporter binding in the anterior cingulate and
      prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 379-88
LID - 10.1111/acps.12424 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of light therapy on serotonin transporter
      binding (5-HTT BPND ), an index of 5-HTT levels, in the anterior cingulate and
      prefrontal cortices (ACC and PFC) of healthy individuals during the fall and
      winter. Twenty-five per cent of healthy individuals experience seasonal mood
      changes that affect functioning. 5-HTT BPND has been found to be higher across
      multiple brain regions in the fall and winter relative to spring and summer, and 
      elevated 5-HTT BPND may lead to extracellular serotonin loss and low mood. We
      hypothesized that, during the fall and winter, light therapy would reduce 5-HTT
      BPND in the ACC and PFC, which sample brain regions involved in mood regulation. 
      METHOD: In a single-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, crossover design,
      [(11) C]DASB positron emission tomography was used measure 5-HTT BPND following
      light therapy and placebo conditions during fall and winter. RESULTS: In winter, 
      light therapy significantly decreased 5-HTT BPND by 12% in the ACC relative to
      placebo (F1,9 = 18.04, P = 0.002). In the fall, no significant change in 5-HTT
      BPND was found in any region across conditions. CONCLUSION: These results
      identify, for the first time, a central biomarker associated with the
      intervention of light therapy in humans which may be applied to further develop
      this treatment for prevention of seasonal depression.

AB  - Maladaptive use of the Internet results in Internet addiction (IA), which is
      associated with various negative consequences. Molecular and functional imaging
      techniques have been increasingly used for analysis of neurobiological changes
      and neurochemical correlates of IA. This review summarizes molecular and
      functional imaging findings on neurobiological mechanisms of IA, focusing on
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear imaging modalities including
      positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT). MRI studies demonstrate that structural changes in frontal cortex are
      associated with functional abnormalities in Internet addicted subjects. Nuclear
      imaging findings indicate that IA is associated with dysfunction of the brain
      dopaminergic systems. Abnormal dopamine regulation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      could underlie the enhanced motivational value and uncontrolled behavior over
      Internet overuse in addicted subjects. Further investigations are needed to
      determine specific changes in the Internet addictive brain, as well as their
      implications for behavior and cognition.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging revealed that trait anxiety predicts the microstructural
      properties of a prespecified fiber tract between the amygdala and the perigenual 
      anterior cingulate cortex. Besides this particular pathway, it is likely that
      other pathways are also affected. We investigated white matter differences in
      persons featuring an anxious or a nonanxious personality, taking into account all
      potential pathway connections between amygdala and anxiety-related regions of the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). Diffusion-weighted images, measures of trait anxiety and
      of reappraisal use (an effective emotion-regulation style), were collected in 48 
      females. With probabilistic tractography, pathways between the amygdala and the
      dorsolateral PFC, dorsomedial PFC, ventromedial PFC, and orbitofrontal cortex
      (OFC) were delineated. The resulting network showed a direct ventral connection
      between amygdala and PFC and a second limbic connection following the fornix and 
      the anterior limb of the internal capsule. Reappraisal use predicted the
      microstructure of pathways to all calculated PFC regions in the left hemisphere, 
      indicating stronger pathways for persons with high reappraisal use. Trait anxiety
      predicted the microstructure in pathways to the ventromedial PFC and OFC,
      indexing weaker connections in trait-anxious persons. These effects appeared in
      the right hemisphere, supporting lateralization and top-down inhibition theories 
      of emotion processing. Whereas a specific microstructure is associated with an
      anxious personality, a different structure subserves emotion regulation. Both are
      part of a broad fiber tract network between amygdala and PFC.

AB  - The human brain, especially the prefrontal cortex (PFC), is functionally and
      anatomically reorganized in order to adapt to neuronal challenges in aging. This 
      study employed structural MRI, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), and high angular
      resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), and examined the functional and structural 
      reorganization of the PFC in aging using a Chinese sample of 173 subjects aged
      from 21 years and above. We found age-related increases in the structural
      connectivity between the PFC and posterior brain regions. Such findings were
      partially mediated by age-related increases in the structural connectivity of the
      occipital lobe within the posterior brain. Based on our findings, it is thought
      that the PFC reorganization in aging could be partly due to the adaptation to
      age-related changes in the structural reorganization of the posterior brain. This
      thus supports the idea derived from task-based fMRI that the PFC reorganization
      in aging may be adapted to the need of compensation for resolving less
      distinctive stimulus information from the posterior brain regions. In addition,
      we found that the structural connectivity of the PFC with the temporal lobe was
      fully mediated by the temporal cortical thickness, suggesting that the brain
      morphology plays an important role in the functional and structural
      reorganization with aging.

PG  - 132

AB  - The neuropeptide oxytocin plays a critical role in social cognition and behavior.
      A number of studies using intranasal administration have demonstrated that
      oxytocin improves social perception. However, little is known about the
      relationship between individual differences in endogenous levels of oxytocin and 
      social cognition. In the current study, we assessed the relationship between
      endogenous oxytocin and brain activity during an animacy perception paradigm.
      Thirty-seven male participants underwent scanning and provided a blood sample for
      oxytocin analysis. In line with previous research, perception of animacy was
      associated with activations in superior temporal sulcus, inferior frontal gyrus, 
      and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Notably, participants' levels of plasma
      oxytocin robustly predicted activation in areas critical for social cognitive
      processes, such that higher oxytocin levels were related to increased activity in
      dorsal mPFC, ventral mPFC, dorsolateral PFC, superior temporal gyrus, and
      temporoparietal junction (TPJ), suggesting differential processing of social
      stimuli. Together these results show that stable variations in endogenous
      oxytocin levels explain individual differences in social perception.

      interactions.
PG  - 125
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00125 [doi]
AB  - Adapting behavior to accommodate changes in the environment is an important
      function of the nervous system. A universal problem for motile animals is the
      discovery that a learned route is blocked and a detour is required. Given the
      substantial neuroscience research on spatial navigation and decision-making it is
      surprising that so little is known about how the brain solves the detour problem.
      Here we review the limited number of relevant functional neuroimaging, single
      unit recording and lesion studies. We find that while the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      consistently responds to detours, the hippocampus does not. Recent evidence
      suggests the hippocampus tracks information about the future path distance to the
      goal. Based on this evidence we postulate a conceptual model in which: Lateral
      PFC provides a prediction error signal about the change in the path, frontopolar 
      and superior PFC support the re-formulation of the route plan as a novel subgoal 
      and the hippocampus simulates the new path. More data will be required to
      validate this model and understand (1) how the system processes the different
      options; and (2) deals with situations where a new path becomes available (i.e., 
      shortcuts).

TI  - Comparison of electroacupuncture and moxibustion on brain-gut function in
      patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: A randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 855-65
LID - 10.1007/s11655-015-2049-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) and moxibustion
      therapies on patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS).
      METHODS: A total of 60 D-IBS patients were randomly allocated to the EA group (30
      cases) and moxibustion group (30 cases). Before and after treatment, the
      gastrointestinal symptoms and psychological symptoms were scored by Visual
      Analogue Scale, Bristol Stool Form Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA),
      and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD); the expressions of
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-HT3 receptor (5-HT3R), and 5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4R) 
      in the sigmoid mucosal tissue were measured by immunohistochemical staining.
      Additionally, the effects on the functional brain areas of the anterior cingulate
      cortex (ACC), insular cortex (IC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were observed by
      functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Compared with before treatment,
      both EA and moxibustion groups reported significant improvements in abdominal
      pain and abdominal bloating after treatment (P<0.01 or P<0.05). The moxibustion
      group reported greater improvements in defecation emergency, defecation
      frequency, and stool feature than the EA group (P<0.01). Both HAMA and HAMD
      scores were significantly decreased in the moxibustion group than in the EA group
      (P<0.01). Both groups demonstrated signifificantly reduced expressions of 5-HT,
      5-HT3R and 5-HT4R in the colonic mucosa after treatment (P<0.01), with a greater 
      reduction of 5-HT in the moxibustion group (P<0.05). Finally, decreased activated
      voxel values were observed in the left IC, right IC and PFC brain regions of
      patients in the moxibustion group under stimulation with 150 mL colorectal
      distension after treatment (P<0.05 or P<0.01), while in the EA group only PFC
      area demonstrated a reduction (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Moxibustion can
      signifificantly improve the symptoms of D-IBS, suggesting that moxibustion may be
      a more effective therapy than EA for D-IBS patients.

AB  - Impairments in working memory (WM) and other cognitive functions are cardinal
      neuropsychological symptoms in schizophrenia (ScZ). The prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      is important for mediating and executing these functions. Functional neuroimaging
      and molecular studies have consistently shown PFC abnormalities in ScZ. In
      addition, recent studies have suggested that impairments in oscillatory activity,
      especially in the gamma band (approximately 30-80 Hz), reflect disturbed cortical
      information processing in this patient group. Here we review evidence that
      dysfunctional gamma-band responses (GBR) in the PFC could be a factor
      contributing to WM and other cognitive deficits in ScZ. We provide an overview of
      noninvasive electrophysiological studies reporting frontal GBR abnormalities in
      ScZ patients during WM and other cognitive tasks. In agreement with the
      often-reported hypofrontality in functional neuroimaging studies, the majority of
      reviewed studies revealed reduced amplitudes or reduced phase locking of GBR over
      frontal areas in this patient group. Clinical implications derived from these
      findings and possibilities to foster future studies on GBR abnormalities in ScZ
      patients, are discussed. Since oscillatory activity in the gamma band has
      previously been linked to a variety of neurotransmitters, such as the
      gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic system, the study of prefrontal GBR could also have
      implications for pharmacologic approaches in the treatment of WM and other
      cognitive deficits in ScZ.

AB  - Many daily behaviors require us to actively focus on the current task and ignore 
      all other distractions. Yet, ignoring everything else might hinder the ability to
      discover new ways to achieve the same goal. Here, we studied the neural
      mechanisms that support the spontaneous change to better strategies while an
      established strategy is executed. Multivariate neuroimaging analyses showed that 
      before the spontaneous change to an alternative strategy, medial prefrontal
      cortex (MPFC) encoded information that was irrelevant for the current strategy
      but necessary for the later strategy. Importantly, this neural effect was related
      to future behavioral changes: information encoding in MPFC was changed only in
      participants who eventually switched their strategy and started before the actual
      strategy change. This allowed us to predict spontaneous strategy shifts ahead of 
      time. These findings suggest that MPFC might internally simulate alternative
      strategies and shed new light on the organization of PFC.

TI  - Brain Correlates of Cognitive Remediation in Schizophrenia: Activation Likelihood
      Analysis Shows Preliminary Evidence of Neural Target Engagement.
PG  - 1276-84
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbv025 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive remediation training (CRT) for schizophrenia has been found to improve 
      cognitive functioning and influence neural plasticity. However, with various
      training approaches and mixed findings, the mechanisms driving generalization of 
      cognitive skills from CRT are unclear. In this meta-analysis of extant imaging
      studies examining CRT's effects, we sought to clarify whether varying approaches 
      to CRT suggest common neural changes and whether such mechanisms are restorative 
      or compensatory. We conducted a literature search to identify studies appropriate
      for inclusion in an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. Our
      criteria required studies to consist of training-based interventions designed to 
      improve patients' cognitive or social functioning, including generalization to
      untrained circumstances. Studies were also required to examine changes in pre- vs
      posttraining functional activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging or
      positron emission tomography. The literature search identified 162 articles, 9 of
      which were appropriate for inclusion. ALE analyses comparing pre- and
      posttraining brain activation showed increased activity in the lateral and medial
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), parietal cortex, insula, and the caudate and thalamus.
      Notably, activation associated with CRT in the left PFC and thalamus partially
      overlapped with previous meta-analytically identified areas associated with
      deficits in working memory, executive control, and facial emotion processing in
      schizophrenia. We conclude that CRT interventions from varying theoretic
      modalities elicit plasticity in areas that support cognitive and socioemotional
      processes in this early set of studies. While preliminary, these changes appear
      to be both restorative and compensatory, though thalamocortical areas previously 
      associated with dysfunction may be common sources of plasticity for cognitive
      remediation in schizophrenia.

AB  - The sense of self has always been a major focus in the psychophysical debate. It 
      has been argued that this complex ongoing internal sense cannot be explained by
      any physical measure and therefore substantiates a mind-body differentiation.
      Recently, however, neuro-imaging studies have associated self-referential
      spontaneous thought, a core-element of the ongoing sense of self, with
      synchronous neural activations during rest in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC),
      as well as the medial and lateral parietal cortices. By applying deep
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over human PFC before rest, we disrupted 
      activity in this neural circuitry thereby inducing reports of lowered
      self-awareness and strong feelings of dissociation. This effect was not found
      with standard or sham TMS, or when stimulation was followed by a task instead of 
      rest. These findings demonstrate for the first time a critical, causal role of
      intact rest-related PFC activity patterns in enabling integrated, enduring,
      self-referential mental processing.

TI  - The neurobiology of emotion-cognition interactions: fundamental questions and
      strategies for future research.
PG  - 58
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00058 [doi]
AB  - Recent years have witnessed the emergence of powerful new tools for assaying the 
      brain and a remarkable acceleration of research focused on the interplay of
      emotion and cognition. This work has begun to yield new insights into fundamental
      questions about the nature of the mind and important clues about the origins of
      mental illness. In particular, this research demonstrates that stress, anxiety,
      and other kinds of emotion can profoundly influence key elements of cognition,
      including selective attention, working memory, and cognitive control. Often, this
      influence persists beyond the duration of transient emotional challenges,
      partially reflecting the slower molecular dynamics of catecholamine and hormonal 
      neurochemistry. In turn, circuits involved in attention, executive control, and
      working memory contribute to the regulation of emotion. The distinction between
      the 'emotional' and the 'cognitive' brain is fuzzy and context-dependent. Indeed,
      there is compelling evidence that brain territories and psychological processes
      commonly associated with cognition, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      and working memory, play a central role in emotion. Furthermore, putatively
      emotional and cognitive regions influence one another via a complex web of
      connections in ways that jointly contribute to adaptive and maladaptive behavior.
      This work demonstrates that emotion and cognition are deeply interwoven in the
      fabric of the brain, suggesting that widely held beliefs about the key
      constituents of 'the emotional brain' and 'the cognitive brain' are fundamentally
      flawed. We conclude by outlining several strategies for enhancing future
      research. Developing a deeper understanding of the emotional-cognitive brain is
      important, not just for understanding the mind but also for elucidating the root 
      causes of its disorders.

TI  - Propensity to obesity impacts the neuronal response to energy imbalance.

AB  - The mechanisms responsible for the propensity to gain weight or remain normal
      weight are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to study the
      neuronal response to visual food cues during short-term energy imbalance in
      healthy adults recruited as obesity-resistant (OR) or obesity-prone (OP) based on
      self-identification, body mass index, and personal/family weight history.
      Twenty-five OR and 28 OP subjects were studied in underfed (UF) and overfed (OF) 
      as compared to eucaloric (EU) conditions in a randomized crossover design. Each
      study phase included a 3-day run-in diet, 1 day of controlled feeding (basal
      energy needs for EU, 40% above/below basal energy needs for OF/UF), and a test
      day. On the test day, fMRI was performed in the acute fed stated (30 min after a 
      test meal) while subjects viewed images of foods of high hedonic value and
      neutral non-food objects. Measures of appetite and hormones were also performed
      before and every 30 min after the test meal. UF was associated with significantly
      increased activation of insula, somatosensory cortex, inferior and medial
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), parahippocampus, precuneus, cingulate, and visual cortex
      in OR. However, UF had no impact in OP. As a result, UF was associated with
      significantly greater activation, specifically in the insula, inferior PFC, and
      somatosensory cortex in OR as compared to OP. While OF was overall associated
      with reduced activation of inferior visual cortex, no group interaction was
      observed with OF. In summary, these findings suggest that individuals resistant
      to weight gain and obesity are more sensitive to short-term energy imbalance,
      particularly with UF, than those prone to weight gain. The inability to sense or 
      adapt to changes in energy balance may represent an important mechanism
      contributing to excess energy intake and risk for obesity.

AB  - Knowledge of online functional brain mechanisms of locomotion is scarce due to
      technical limitations of traditional neuroimaging methods. Using functional Near 
      Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) we evaluated task-related changes in oxygenated
      hemoglobin levels (HbO2) in real-time over the pre-frontal-cortex (PFC) regions
      during simple (Normal Walk; NW) and attention-demanding (Walking While Talking;
      WWT) locomotion tasks in a large cohort of non-demented older adults. Results
      revealed that the assessment of task-related changes in HbO2 was internally
      consistent. Imposing greater demands on the attention system during locomotion
      resulted in robust bilateral PFC increases in HbO2 levels during WWT compared to 
      NW and the cognitive interference tasks. Elevated PFC oxygenation levels were
      maintained throughout the course of WWT but not during the NW condition.
      Increased oxygenation levels in the PFC were related to greater stride length and
      better cognitive performance but not to faster gait velocity in WWT. These
      findings elucidate online brain mechanisms of locomotion, and confer significant 
      implications for risk assessment and intervention for major mobility outcomes.

TI  - Prefrontal cortex and the dysconnectivity hypothesis of schizophrenia.
PG  - 207-19
LID - 10.1007/s12264-014-1502-8 [doi]
AB  - Schizophrenia is hypothesized to arise from disrupted brain connectivity. This
      "dysconnectivity hypothesis" has generated interest in discovering whether there 
      is anatomical and functional dysconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
      and other brain regions, and how this dysconnectivity is linked to the impaired
      cognitive functions and aberrant behaviors of schizophrenia. Critical advances in
      neuroimaging technologies, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), make it possible to explore these
      issues. DTI affords the possibility to explore anatomical connectivity in the
      human brain in vivo and fMRI can be used to make inferences about functional
      connections between brain regions. In this review, we present major advances in
      the understanding of PFC anatomical and functional dysconnectivity and their
      implications in schizophrenia. We then briefly discuss future prospects that need
      to be explored in order to move beyond simple mapping of connectivity changes to 
      elucidate the neuronal mechanisms underlying schizophrenia.

TI  - Modulation of hippocampal theta and hippocampal-prefrontal cortex function by a
      schizophrenia risk gene.
PG  - 2387-95
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22778 [doi]
AB  - Hippocampal theta-band oscillations are thought to facilitate the co-ordination
      of brain activity across distributed networks, including between the hippocampus 
      and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Impairments in hippocampus-PFC functional
      connectivity are implicated in schizophrenia and are associated with a
      polymorphism within the ZNF804A gene that shows a genome-wide significant
      association with schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms by which ZNF804A affects 
      hippocampus-PFC connectivity are unknown. We used a multimodal imaging approach
      to investigate the impact of the ZNF804A polymorphism on hippocampal theta and
      hippocampal network coactivity. Healthy volunteers homozygous for the ZNF804A
      rs1344706 (A[risk]/C[nonrisk]) polymorphism were imaged at rest using both
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A 
      dual-regression approach was used to investigate coactivations between the
      hippocampal network and other brain regions for both modalities, focusing on the 
      theta band in the case of MEG. We found a significant decrease in
      intrahippocampal theta (using MEG) and greater coactivation of the superior
      frontal gyrus with the hippocampal network (using fMRI) in risk versus nonrisk
      homozygotes. Furthermore, these measures showed a significant negative
      correlation. Our demonstration of an inverse relationship between hippocampal
      theta and hippocampus-PFC coactivation supports a role for hippocampal theta in
      coordinating hippocampal-prefrontal activity. The ZNF804A-related differences
      that we find in hippocampus-PFC coactivation are consistent with previously
      reported associations with functional connectivity and with these changes lying
      downstream of altered hippocampal theta. Changes in hippocampal-PFC
      co-ordination, driven by differences in oscillatory activity, may be one
      mechanism by which ZNF804A impacts on brain function and risk for psychosis.

TI  - Noradrenergic stimulation modulates activation of extinction-related brain
      regions and enhances contextual extinction learning without affecting renewal.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00034 [doi]
AB  - Renewal in extinction learning describes the recovery of an extinguished response
      if the extinction context differs from the context present during acquisition and
      recall. Attention may have a role in contextual modulation of behavior and
      contribute to the renewal effect, while noradrenaline (NA) is involved in
      attentional processing. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      study we investigated the role of the noradrenergic system for behavioral and
      brain activation correlates of contextual extinction and renewal, with a
      particular focus upon hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), which
      have crucial roles in processing of renewal. Healthy human volunteers received a 
      single dose of the NA reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine prior to extinction
      learning. During extinction of previously acquired cue-outcome associations, cues
      were presented in a novel context (ABA) or in the acquisition context (AAA). In
      recall, all cues were again presented in the acquisition context. Atomoxetine
      participants (ATO) showed significantly faster extinction compared to placebo
      (PLAC). However, atomoxetine did not affect renewal. Hippocampal activation was
      higher in ATO during extinction and recall, as was ventromedial PFC activation,
      except for ABA recall. Moreover, ATO showed stronger recruitment of insula,
      anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral/orbitofrontal PFC. Across groups, cingulate,
      hippocampus and vmPFC activity during ABA extinction correlated with recall
      performance, suggesting high relevance of these regions for processing the
      renewal effect. In summary, the noradrenergic system appears to be involved in
      the modification of established associations during extinction learning and thus 
      has a role in behavioral flexibility. The assignment of an association to a
      context and the subsequent decision on an adequate response, however, presumably 
      operate largely independently of noradrenergic mechanisms.

TI  - Resting-state functional connectivity of antero-medial prefrontal cortex
      sub-regions in major depression and relationship to emotional intelligence.
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyu112 [doi]
LID - pyu112 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder has been associated with abnormal
      resting-state functional connectivity (FC), especially in cognitive processing
      and emotional regulation networks. Although studies have found abnormal FC in
      regions of the default mode network (DMN), no study has investigated the FC of
      specific regions within the anterior DMN based on cytoarchitectonic subdivisions 
      of the antero-medial pre-frontal cortex (PFC). Studies from different areas in
      the field have shown regions within the anterior DMN to be involved in emotional 
      intelligence. Although abnormalities in this region have been observed in
      depression, the relationship between the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) function and
      emotional intelligence has yet to be investigated in depressed individuals.
      METHODS: Twenty-one medication-free, non-treatment resistant, depressed patients 
      and 21 healthy controls underwent a resting state functional magnetic resonance
      imaging session. The participants also completed an ability-based measure of
      emotional intelligence: the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. FC 
      maps of Brodmann areas (BA) 25, 10 m, 10r, and 10p were created and compared
      between the two groups. RESULTS: Mixed-effects analyses showed that the more
      anterior seeds encompassed larger areas of the DMN. Compared to healthy controls,
      depressed patients had significantly lower connectivity between BA10p and the
      right insula and between BA25 and the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex.
      Exploratory analyses showed an association between vmPFC connectivity and
      emotional intelligence. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that individuals with 
      depression have reduced FC between antero-medial PFC regions and regions involved
      in emotional regulation compared to control subjects. Moreover, vmPFC functional 
      connectivity appears linked to emotional intelligence.

AB  - Cognitive impairment, particularly involving dysfunction of circuitry within the 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), represents a core feature of many neuropsychiatric and
      neurodevelopmental disorders, including depression, post-traumatic stress
      disorder, schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. Deficits in cognitive
      function also represent the most difficult symptom domain to successfully treat, 
      as serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants have only modest
      effects. Functional neuroimaging studies and postmortem analysis of human brain
      tissue implicate the PFC as being a primary region of dysregulation in patients
      with these disorders. However, preclinical behavioral assays used to assess these
      deficits in mouse models which can be readily manipulated genetically and could
      provide the basis for studies of new treatment avenues have been underutilized.
      Here we describe the adaptation of a behavioral assay, the attentional set
      shifting task (AST), to be performed in mice to assess prefrontal cortex mediated
      cognitive deficits. The neural circuits underlying behavior during the AST are
      highly conserved across humans, nonhuman primates and rodents, providing
      excellent face, construct and predictive validity.

TI  - Multicenter mapping of structural network alterations in autism.
PG  - 2364-73
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22776 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental conditions
      primarily characterized by abnormalities in social cognition. Abundant previous
      functional MRI studies have shown atypical activity in networks encompassing
      medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and medial parietal regions corresponding to
      posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCC/PCU). Conversely, studies assessing
      structural brain anomalies in ASD have been rather inconsistent. The current work
      evaluated whether structural changes in ASD can be reliability detected in a
      large multicenter dataset. Our comprehensive structural MRI framework encompassed
      cortical thickness mapping and structural covariance analysis based on three
      independent samples comprising individuals with ASD and controls (n = 220),
      selected from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange open-access database.
      Surface-based analysis revealed increased cortical thickness in ASD relative to
      controls in mPFC and lateral prefrontal cortex. Clusters encompassing mPFC were
      embedded in altered inter-regional covariance networks, showing decreased
      covariance in ASD relative to controls primarily to PCC/PCU and inferior parietal
      regions. Cortical thickness increases and covariance reductions in ASD were
      consistent, yet of variable effect size, across the different sites evaluated and
      measurable both in children and adults. Our multisite study shows regional and
      network-level structural alterations in mPFC in ASD that, possibly, relate to
      atypical socio-cognitive functions in this condition.

TI  - Mapping of functionally characterized cell classes onto canonical circuit
      operations in primate prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 2975-91
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2700-14.2015 [doi]
AB  - Microcircuits are composed of multiple cell classes that likely serve unique
      circuit operations. But how cell classes map onto circuit functions is largely
      unknown, particularly for primate prefrontal cortex during actual goal-directed
      behavior. One difficulty in this quest is to reliably distinguish cell classes in
      extracellular recordings of action potentials. Here we surmount this issue and
      report that spike shape and neural firing variability provide reliable markers to
      segregate seven functional classes of prefrontal cells in macaques engaged in an 
      attention task. We delineate an unbiased clustering protocol that identifies four
      broad spiking (BS) putative pyramidal cell classes and three narrow spiking (NS) 
      putative inhibitory cell classes dissociated by how sparse, bursty, or regular
      they fire. We speculate that these functional classes map onto canonical circuit 
      functions. First, two BS classes show sparse, bursty firing, and phase
      synchronize their spiking to 3-7 Hz (theta) and 12-20 Hz (beta) frequency bands
      of the local field potential (LFP). These properties make cells flexibly
      responsive to network activation at varying frequencies. Second, one NS and two
      BS cell classes show regular firing and higher rate with only marginal
      synchronization preference. These properties are akin to setting tonically the
      excitation and inhibition balance. Finally, two NS classes fired irregularly and 
      synchronized to either theta or beta LFP fluctuations, tuning them potentially to
      frequency-specific subnetworks. These results suggest that a limited set of
      functional cell classes emerges in macaque prefrontal cortex (PFC) during
      attentional engagement to not only represent information, but to subserve basic
      circuit operations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists augment cognition
      among cigarette smokers and nonsmokers, yet the systems-level neurobiological
      mechanisms underlying such improvements are not fully understood. Aggregating
      neuroimaging results regarding nAChR agonists provides a means to identify common
      functional brain changes that may be related to procognitive drug effects.
      METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of pharmacologic neuroimaging studies
      within the activation likelihood estimation framework. We identified published
      studies contrasting a nAChR drug condition versus a baseline and coded each
      contrast by activity change direction (decrease or increase), participant
      characteristics (smokers or nonsmokers), and drug manipulation employed
      (pharmacologic administration or cigarette smoking). RESULTS: When considering
      all studies, nAChR agonist administration was associated with activity decreases 
      in multiple regions, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC),
      posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), parahippocampus, insula, and the parietal and
      precentral cortices. Conversely, activity increases were observed in lateral
      frontoparietal cortices, the anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and cuneus.
      Exploratory analyses indicated that both smokers and nonsmokers showed activity
      decreases in the vmPFC and PCC, and increases in lateral frontoparietal regions. 
      Among smokers, both pharmacologic administration and cigarette smoking were
      associated with activity decreases in the vmPFC, PCC, and insula and increases in
      the lateral PFC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and cuneus.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the systems-level perspective that
      nAChR agonists suppress activity in default-mode network regions and enhance
      activity in executive control network regions in addition to reducing activation 
      of some task-related regions. We speculate these are potential mechanisms by
      which nAChR agonists enhance cognition.

TI  - Deficits in prefrontal cortical and extrastriatal dopamine release in
      schizophrenia: a positron emission tomographic functional magnetic resonance
      imaging study.
PG  - 316-24
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2014.2414 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Multiple lines of evidence suggest a deficit in dopamine release in
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in schizophrenia. Despite the prevalence of the
      concept of prefrontal cortical hypodopaminergia in schizophrenia, in vivo imaging
      of dopamine release in the PFC has not been possible until now, when the validity
      of using the positron emission tomographic D2/3 radiotracer carbon 11-labeled
      FLB457 in combination with the amphetamine paradigm was clearly established.
      OBJECTIVES: To (1) test amphetamine-induced dopamine release in the dorsolateral 
      PFC (DLPFC) in drug-free or drug-naive patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and
      healthy control (HC) individuals matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
      familial socioeconomic status;(2) test blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
      functional magnetic resonance imaging activation during a working memory task in 
      the same participants; and (3) examine the relationship between positron emission
      tomographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging outcome measures. DESIGN,
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Positron emission tomographic imaging with carbon
      11-labeled FLB457 before and following 0.5 mg/kg of amphetamine by mouth. Blood
      oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging during the
      self-ordered working memory task. Twenty patients with schizophrenia recruited
      from the inpatient and outpatient research facilities at New York State
      Psychiatric Institute and 21 healthy control individuals participated, and data
      were acquired between June 16, 2011, and February 25, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND
      MEASURE: The percentage change in binding potential (BPND) in the DLPFC following
      amphetamine, BOLD activation during the self-ordered working memory task compared
      with the control task, and the correlation between these 2 outcome measures.
      RESULTS: We observed significant differences in the effect of amphetamine on
      DLPFC BPND (mean [SD], BPND in HC: -7.5% [11%]; SCZ: +1.8% [11%]; P = .01); a
      generalized blunting in dopamine release in SCZ involving most extrastriatal
      regions and the midbrain; and a significant association between BPND and BOLD
      activation in the DLPFC in the overall sample including patients with SCZ and HC 
      individuals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, these results provide
      the first in vivo evidence for a deficit in the capacity for dopamine release in 
      the DLPFC in SCZ and suggest a more widespread deficit extending to many cortical
      and extrastriatal regions including the midbrain. This contrasts with the
      well-replicated excess in dopamine release in the associative striatum in SCZ and
      suggests a differential regulation of striatal dopamine release in associative
      striatum vs extrastriatal regions. Furthermore, dopamine release in the DLPFC
      relates to working memory-related activation of this region, suggesting that
      blunted release may affect frontal cortical function.

TI  - Neural correlates of expected risks and returns in risky choice across
      development.
PG  - 1549-60
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1924-14.2015 [doi]
AB  - Adolescence is often described as a period of increased risk taking relative to
      both childhood and adulthood. This inflection in risky choice behavior has been
      attributed to a neurobiological imbalance between earlier developing motivational
      systems and later developing top-down control regions. Yet few studies have
      decomposed risky choice to investigate the underlying mechanisms or tracked their
      differential developmental trajectory. The current study uses a risk-return
      decomposition to more precisely assess the development of processes underlying
      risky choice and to link them more directly to specific neural mechanisms. This
      decomposition specifies the influence of changing risks (outcome variability) and
      changing returns (expected value) on the choices of children, adolescents, and
      adults in a dynamic risky choice task, the Columbia Card Task. Behaviorally, risk
      aversion increased across age groups, with adults uniformly risk averse and
      adolescents showing substantial individual differences in risk sensitivity,
      ranging from risk seeking to risk averse. Neurally, we observed an adolescent
      peak in risk-related activation in the anterior insula and dorsal medial PFC.
      Return sensitivity, on the other hand, increased monotonically across age groups 
      and was associated with increased activation in the ventral medial PFC and
      posterior cingulate cortex with age. Our results implicate adolescence as a
      developmental phase of increased neural risk sensitivity. Importantly, this work 
      shows that using a behaviorally validated decision-making framework allows a
      precise operationalization of key constructs underlying risky choice that inform 
      the interpretation of results.

TI  - Changes in Effective Connectivity Between Dorsal and Ventral Prefrontal Regions
      Moderate Emotion Regulation.
LID - bhv005 [pii]
AB  - Reappraisal, the cognitive reevaluation of a potentially emotionally arousing
      event, has been proposed to be based upon top-down appraisal systems within the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). It still remains unclear, however, how different
      prefrontal regions interact to control and regulate emotional responses. We used 
      fMRI and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to characterize the functional
      interrelationships among dorsal and ventral PFC regions involved in reappraisal. 
      Specifically, we examined the effective connectivity between the inferior frontal
      gyrus (IFG), dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and other reappraisal-related regions
      (supplementary motor area, supramarginal gyrus) during the up- and downregulation
      of emotions in response to highly arousing extreme sports film clips. We found
      DLPFC to be the central node of the prefrontal emotion regulation network,
      strongly interconnected with the IFG. The DCM analysis further revealed
      excitatory changes of connection strength from the DLPFC to the IFG and strong
      inhibitory changes of connection strength between the IFG and DLPFC during
      reappraisal. These bidirectional changes in connectivity strength indicate a
      feedback mechanism by which the IFG may select one out of several possible
      goal-appropriate reappraisals held active in working memory (represented in the
      DLPFC) and inhibits the DLPFC once the selection process is completed.

AB  - Older adults often show different functional activation patterns than younger
      adults in prefrontal cortex (PFC) when performing cognitive control tasks. These 
      differences include age-related increases in PFC activation magnitude and
      reorganized PFC functional connectivity (fC) patterns. However, it remains
      unclear whether age-related alterations in brain activation patterns reflect a
      positive mechanism (e.g., compensatory response) or a sign of brain dysfunction
      (e.g., reduced efficiency). Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) to compare PFC activation magnitudes and PFC connectivity patterns between
      younger and older adult groups during performance of a task switching paradigm.
      Results indicated age-related increases both in PFC activation magnitudes and in 
      PFC fC with inferotemporal (IT) regions. However, these age-related fMRI
      increases were differentially associated with task performance. Whereas increased
      PFC activation magnitudes tended to be either unrelated to task RT or associated 
      with poorer task performance, increased PFC-IT connectivity was associated with
      better task performance in older adults. Our results suggest that age-related
      reductions in efficiency and successful compensation can co-exist in older adults
      in the context of the same task.

AB  - Clinical brain imaging and postmortem studies provide evidence of structural and 
      functional abnormalities of key limbic and cortical structures in depressed
      patients, suggesting that spine synapse connectivity is altered in depression.
      Characterization of the cellular determinants underlying these changes in
      patients are limited, but studies in rodent models demonstrate alterations of
      dendrite complexity and spine density and function that could contribute to the
      morphological and functional alterations observed in humans. Rodent studies
      demonstrate region specific effects in chronic stress models of depression,
      including reductions in dendrite complexity and spine density in the hippocampus 
      and prefrontal cortex (PFC) but increases in the basolateral amygdala and nucleus
      accumbens. Alterations of spine synapse connectivity in these regions are thought
      to contribute to the behavioral symptoms of depression, including disruption of
      cognition, mood, emotion, motivation, and reward. Studies of the mechanisms
      underlying these effects demonstrate a role for altered brain derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling that regulates synaptic protein synthesis.
      In contrast, there is evidence that chronic antidepressant treatment can block or
      reverse the spine synapse alterations caused by stress. Notably, the new fast
      acting antidepressant ketamine, which produces rapid therapeutic actions in
      treatment resistant MDD patients, rapidly increases spine synapse number in the
      PFC of rodents and reverses the effects of chronic stress. The rapid synaptic and
      behavioral actions of ketamine occur via increased BDNF regulation of synaptic
      protein synthesis. Together these studies provide evidence for a neurotophic and 
      synaptogenic hypothesis of depression and treatment response and indicate that
      spine synapse connectivity in key cortical and limbic brain regions is critical
      for control of mood and emotion.

TI  - Moderate-level prenatal alcohol exposure induces sex differences in dopamine d1
      receptor binding in adult rhesus monkeys.
PG  - 2934-43

AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and/or 
      prenatal stress exposure on (D1 R) binding in a non human primate model. The
      dopamine D1 R is involved in executive function, and it may play a role in
      cognitive behavioral deficits associated with prenatal alcohol and/or stress
      exposure. Little is known, however, about the effects of prenatal alcohol and/or 
      stress exposure on the D1 R. We expected that prenatal insults would lead to
      alterations in D1 R binding in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum in adulthood.
      METHODS: Rhesus macaque females were randomly assigned to moderate alcohol
      exposure and/or mild prenatal stress as well as a control condition during
      pregnancy. Thirty-eight offspring were raised identically and studied as adults
      by noninvasive in vivo neuroimaging using positron emission tomography with the
      D1 antagonist radiotracer [(11) C]SCH 23390. Radiotracer binding in PFC and
      striatum was evaluated by 2 (alcohol) x 2 (stress) x 2 (sex) analysis of
      variance. RESULTS: In PFC, a significant alcohol x sex interaction was observed
      with prenatal alcohol exposure leading to increased [(11) C]SCH 23390 binding in 
      male monkeys. No main effect of prenatal alcohol or prenatal stress exposure was 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure
      results in long-term increases in prefrontal dopamine D1 R binding in males. This
      may help explain gender differences in the prevalence of neurodevelopmental
      disorders consequent to prenatal alcohol exposure.

AB  - The animal and blood-injection-injury (BII) subtypes of specific phobia are both 
      characterized by subjective fear but distinct autonomic reactions to threat.
      Previous functional neuroimaging studies have related these characteristic
      responses to shared and non-shared neural underpinnings. However, no comparative 
      structural data are available. This study aims to fill this gap by comparing the 
      two subtypes and also comparing them with a non-phobic control group. Gray and
      white matter data of 33 snake phobia subjects (SP), 26 dental phobia subjects
      (DP), and 37 healthy control (HC) subjects were analyzed with voxel-based
      morphometry. Especially DP differed from HC and SP by showing significantly
      increased grey matter volumes in widespread areas including the right subgenual
      anterior cingulate gyrus, left insula, left orbitofrontal and left prefrontal
      (PFC) cortices. In addition, white matter volume was significantly increased in
      the left PFC in DP compared with SP. These results are in line with functional
      changes observed in dental phobia and point toward those brain circuits
      associated with emotional processing and regulation. Future studies should aim to
      further delineate functional and structural connectivity alterations in specific 
      phobia.

AB  - Neuroimaging research has shown that acute bouts of moderate intensity aerobic
      exercise can enhance attention-based neuronal activity in frontal brain regions, 
      namely in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as improve cognitive performance. 
      The circuitry of the PFC is complex with extensive reciprocal corticocortical and
      thalamocortical connections, yet it remains unclear if aerobic exercise can also 
      assist attentional control over modality-specific sensory cortices. To test this,
      we used a tactile discrimination task to compare tactile event-related potentials
      (ERPs) prior to and following an acute bout of moderate intensity aerobic
      exercise. We hypothesized that exercise preceding performance of the task would
      result in more efficient sensory gating of irrelevant/non-attended and
      enhancement of relevant/attended sensory information, respectively. Participants 
      received vibrotactile stimulation to the second and fifth digit on the left hand 
      and reported target stimuli on one digit only. ERP amplitudes for the P50, P100, 
      N140 and long latency positivity (LLP) were quantified for attended and
      non-attended trials at FC4, C4, CP4 and P4 while P300 amplitudes were quantified 
      in response to attended target stimuli at electrodes FCZ, CZ and CPZ. Results
      showed no effect of attention on the P50, however, both P100 and LLP amplitudes
      were significantly greater during attended, task-relevant trials, while the N140 
      was enhanced for non-attended, task-irrelevant stimuli. Moreover, unattended N140
      amplitudes over parietal sites contralateral to stimulation were significantly
      greater post-exercise versus pre-exercise, while LLP modulation varied with
      greater unattended amplitudes post-exercise over frontal sites and greater
      attended amplitudes post-exercise over parietal sites. These results suggest that
      a single session of moderate intensity aerobic exercise facilitated the sensory
      gating of task-irrelevant tactile stimuli so that relevant sensory signals could 
      be enhanced at later stages of somatosensory processing in healthy young adults.

TI  - Positron emission tomography quantification of serotonin(1A) receptor binding in 
      suicide attempters with major depressive disorder.
PG  - 169-78

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Serotonergic system dysfunction has been associated with increased
      lethal suicide attempts and suicide. Dysfunction includes higher binding of
      serotonin(1A) autoreceptor in the brainstem raphe of individuals who die by
      suicide. OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationships between brain serotonin(1A)
      binding and suicidal behavior in vivo in major depressive disorder (MDD) using
      positron emission tomography and the serotonin(1A) antagonist radiotracer carbon 
      C 11 [11C]-labeled WAY-100635. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional
      positron emission tomography study at an academic medical center from 1999
      through 2009. We compared serotonin(1A) binding between individuals with MDD who 
      did not attempt suicide (nonattempters) (n = 62) and those who attempted suicide 
      (attempters) (n = 29). We subdivided the attempters into those with lower (n =
      16) and higher (n = 13) levels of lethality. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The
      binding potential (BPF) of [11C]WAY-100635 (calculated as the number of receptors
      available divided by affinity) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and brainstem,
      estimated by kinetic modeling with an arterial input function; the severity of
      suicidal behaviors, including lethality and intent of suicide attempts; and
      suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Using a linear mixed-effects model, we found no
      difference between attempters and nonattempters with MDD in serotonin(1A) BPF in 
      the PFC regions (F1,88 = 0.03; P = .87) or in the raphe nuclei (F1,88 = 0.29; P =
      .59). Raphe nuclei serotonin(1A) BPF was 45.1% greater in higher-lethality
      attempters compared with lower-lethality attempters (F1,25 = 7.33; P = .01),
      whereas no difference was observed in the PFC regions (F1,25 = 0.12; P = .73).
      Serotonin(1A )BPF in the raphe nuclei of suicide attempters was positively
      correlated with the lethality rating (F1,25 = 10.56; P = .003) and the subjective
      lethal intent factor (F1,25 = 10.63; P = .003; R2 = 0.32) based on the most
      recent suicide attempt. Suicide ideation in participants with MDD was positively 
      correlated with serotonin(1A) BPF in the PFC regions (F1,88 = 5.19; P = .03) and 
      in the raphe nuclei (F1,87 = 7.38; P = .008; R2 = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS AND
      RELEVANCE: Higher brainstem raphe serotonin(1A)BPF observed in higher-lethality
      suicide attempters with MDD is in agreement with findings in suicide studies and 
      also with the finding of low cerebrospinal fluid levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic 
      acid in higher-lethality suicide attempters. Higher brainstem raphe serotonin(1A)
      BPF would be consistent with lower levels of serotonin neuron firing and release 
      and supports a model of impaired serotonin signaling in suicide and
      higher-lethality suicidal behavior. Severity of suicidal ideation in MDD is
      related to brainstem and prefrontal serotonin(1A) BPF, suggesting a role for both
      regions in suicidal ideation. Lower levels of serotonin release at key brain
      projection sites, such as the prefrontal regions, may favor more severe suicidal 
      ideation and higher-lethality suicide attempts.

TI  - Common and unique representations in pFC for face and place attractiveness.
PG  - 959-73
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00777 [doi]
AB  - Although previous neuroimaging research has identified overlapping correlates of 
      subjective value across different reward types in the ventromedial pFC (vmPFC),
      it is not clear whether this "common currency" evaluative signal extends to the
      aesthetic domain. To examine this issue, we scanned human participants with fMRI 
      while they made attractiveness judgments of faces and places-two stimulus
      categories that are associated with different underlying rewards, have very
      different visual properties, and are rarely compared with each other. We found
      overlapping signals for face and place attractiveness in the vmPFC, consistent
      with the idea that this region codes a signal for value that applies across
      disparate reward types and across both economic and aesthetic judgments. However,
      we also identified a subregion of vmPFC within which activity patterns for face
      and place attractiveness were distinguishable, suggesting that some
      category-specific attractiveness information is retained in this region. Finally,
      we observed two separate functional regions in lateral OFC: one region that
      exhibited a category-unique response to face attractiveness and another region
      that responded strongly to faces but was insensitive to their value. Our results 
      suggest that vmPFC supports a common mechanism for reward evaluation while also
      retaining a degree of category-specific information, whereas lateral OFC may be
      involved in basic reward processing that is specific to only some stimulus
      categories.

AB  - The gene Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) has been indicated as a determinant
      of psychopathology, including affective disorders, and shown to influence
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus functioning, regions of major interest
      for affective disorders. We aimed to investigate whether DISC1 differentially
      modulates brain function during executive and memory processing, and morphology
      in regions relevant for depression and anxiety disorders (affective disorders).
      128 participants, with (n = 103) and without (controls; n = 25) affective
      disorders underwent genotyping for Ser704Cys (with Cys-allele considered as
      risk-allele) and structural and functional (f) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
      during visuospatial planning and emotional episodic memory tasks. For both
      voxel-based morphometry and fMRI analyses, we investigated the effect of genotype
      in controls and explored genotypeXdiagnosis interactions. Results are reported at
      p < 0.05 FWE small volume corrected. In controls, Cys-carriers showed smaller
      bilateral (para)hippocampal volumes compared with Ser-homozygotes, and lower
      activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral PFC during
      visuospatial planning. In anxiety patients, Cys-carriers showed larger
      (para)hippocampal volumes and more ACC activation during visuospatial planning.
      In depressive patients, no effect of genotype was observed and overall, no effect
      of genotype on episodic memory processing was detected. We demonstrated that
      Ser704Cys-genotype influences (para)hippocampal structure and functioning the
      dorsal PFC during executive planning, most prominently in unaffected controls.
      Results suggest that presence of psychopathology moderates Ser704Cys effects.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that one's brain response to high-calorie food cues
      can predict long-term weight gain or weight loss. The neural correlates that
      predict food intake in the short term have, however, hardly been investigated.
      This study examined which brain regions' activation predicts chocolate intake
      after participants had been either exposed to real chocolate or to control
      stimuli during approximately one hour, with interruptions for fMRI measurements. 
      Further we investigated whether the variance in chocolate intake could be better 
      explained by activated brain regions than by self-reported craving. In total,
      five brain regions correlated with subsequent chocolate intake. The activation of
      two reward regions (the right caudate and the left frontopolar cortex) correlated
      positively with intake in the exposure group. The activation of two regions
      associated with cognitive control (the left dorsolateral and left
      mid-dorsolateral PFC) correlated negatively with intake in the control group.
      When the regression analysis was conducted with the exposure and the control
      group together, an additional region's activation (the right anterior PFC)
      correlated positively with chocolate intake. In all analyses, the intake variance
      explained by neural correlates was above and beyond the variance explained by
      self-reported craving. These results are in line with neuroimaging research
      showing that brain responses are a better predictor of subsequent intake than
      self-reported craving. Therefore, our findings might provide for a missing link
      by associating brain activation, previously shown to predict weight change, with 
      short-term intake.

TI  - Brain regions involved in moxibustion-induced analgesia in irritable bowel
      syndrome with diarrhea: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.
PG  - 500

AB  - BACKGROUND: Moxibustion is one of the most commonly used therapies in acupuncture
      practice, and is demonstrated to be beneficial for patients with diarrhea from
      irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). But its mechanism remains unclear. Because
      visceral hypersensitivity in IBS patients has been documented by evaluation of
      perceived stimulations through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      studies, we focused on observing brain imaging changes in D-IBS patients during
      rectal balloon distention before and after moxibustion in order to reveal its
      possible central mechanism and further evaluate its effect. METHODS: This
      clinical trial is registered under the number: ChiCTR-TRC-10000887. Eighty D-IBS 
      patients were randomly divided into a moxibustion and sham moxibustion group
      (control group) for a 4-week treatment. Fifteen patients in moxibustion group and
      thirteen patients in control group completed two fMRI scans during a 50 and 100
      ml rectal balloon distention before and after treatment. Rectal pain were
      obtained with a scan test. Birmingham IBS Symptom Scale and IBS Quality of Life
      (QOL) Scale were used to evaluate therapeutic effect. RESULTS: After treatment,
      the decrease in Birmingham IBS Symptom Scale and IBS QOL Scale scores in
      moxibustion group was significantly greater than that of control group (P <
      0.01). The defecation urge threshold and the pain perception threshold of
      moxibustion group was also significantly higher after treatment than that of
      control group (P < 0.01). The decrease in pain score during the 100 ml rectal
      balloon distention in moxibustion group was significantly greater than that of
      control group (P < 0.05). There was no definite activated center during the 50 ml
      rectal distention in either group before treatment. After treatment, the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) was affected in moxibustion group, while the PFC and the 
      anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) were affected in control group. During the 100
      ml distention before treatment in both groups, the PFC and ACC were activated.
      After treatment, they disappeared in moxibustion group but remained in control
      group. CONCLUSIONS: Moxibustion can improve symptoms and quality of life in D-IBS
      patients. It can also decrease rectal sensitivity. The activation of PFC and ACC 
      during a 100 ml rectal distention disappeared after moxibustion treatment.

TI  - Measuring cigarette smoking-induced cortical dopamine release: A [(1)(1)C]FLB-457
      PET study.
PG  - 1417-27
LID - 10.1038/npp.2014.327 [doi]
AB  - Striatal dopamine (DA) is thought to have a fundamental role in the reinforcing
      effects of tobacco smoking and nicotine. Microdialysis studies indicate that
      nicotine also increases DA in extrastriatal brain areas, but much less is known
      about its role in addiction. High-affinity D2/3 receptor radiotracers permit the 
      measurement of cortical DA in humans using positron emission tomography (PET).
      [(11)C]FLB-457 PET scans were conducted in 10 nicotine-dependent daily smokers
      after overnight abstinence and reinstatement of smoking. Voxel-wise
      [(11)C]-FLB-457-binding potential (BPND) in the frontal lobe, insula, and limbic 
      regions was estimated in the two conditions. Paired t-tests showed BPND values
      were reduced following smoking (an indirect index of DA release). The overall
      peak t was located in the cingulate gyrus, which was part of a larger medial
      cluster (BPND change -12.1+/-9.4%) and this survived false discovery rate
      correction for multiple comparisons. Clusters were also identified in the left
      anterior cingulate cortex/medial frontal gyrus, bilateral prefrontal cortex
      (PFC), bilateral amygdala, and the left insula. This is the first demonstration
      of tobacco smoking-induced cortical DA release in humans; it may be the result of
      both pharmacological (nicotine) and non-pharmacological factors (tobacco cues).
      Abstinence increased craving but had minimal cognitive effects, thus limiting
      correlation analyses. However, given that the cingulate cortex, PFC, insula, and 
      amygdala are thought to have important roles in tobacco craving, cognition, and
      relapse, these associations warrant investigation in a larger sample.
      [(11)C]FLB-457 PET imaging may represent a useful tool to investigate individual 
      differences in tobacco addiction severity and treatment response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Picking up statistical regularities of patterns from the environment 
      is essential for predictive and adaptive behavior. One of the most important
      challenges is to understand how statistical learning occurs and how the acquired 
      information consolidates and stabilizes in the brain. Evidence suggests that the 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) has a critical role in these processes; the division of
      labor between hemispheres, however, is less characterized. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: 
      The aim of the present study was to directly investigate the causal role of the
      right and left PFC in statistical learning and its consolidation. METHODS:
      Healthy, young adults were trained on a probabilistic sequence learning task.
      Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right or left
      dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) was applied during the training in order to modify
      learning-related cortical plasticity in the targeted brain regions by increasing 
      neural excitability. Performance was tested during and immediately after the
      stimulation, 2-h and 24-h later. RESULTS: We found that the anodal tDCS over the 
      right DLPFC led to enhanced learning performance both after the 2-h and 24-h
      retention periods, suggesting the causal role of this area in statistical
      learning. In contrast, we did not find any effect of left DLPFC stimulation on
      learning. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the role of the right
      fronto-striatal network in statistical learning and its consolidation.

TI  - Remoteness modulates the effects of emotional valence on the neural network of
      autobiographical memory in older females.
PG  - 23-54
AB  - To better understand the effects of emotional valence on autobiographical memory 
      (AM), the present study compared behavioral performance and neural activation in 
      positive and negative AMs at different levels of remoteness (the time-interval
      between encoding and retrieving) in a sample of Chinese older females. The
      behavioral results revealed that older females held a positivity bias in
      emotional AM in the form of an obvious trend of higher level of vividness when
      retrieving positive AMs compared with negative AMs. At the neural level, a
      de-lateralized neural network, covering the core AM system and the affect
      processing system, was found to be associated with emotional AM. Within the
      network, increased activation of a prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex
      (PFC/ACC) control system was found when processing negative recent AMs compared
      with positive recent AMs; increased activation of the somatosensory area was
      found with positive remote AMs compared with negative remote AMs. On the basis of
      these results, we suggest that the positivity bias of the older adults in recent 
      AMs may be due to the use of an emotion regulation or control system (involving
      PFC/ACC) against negative AMs; in contrast, for remote AMs, the positivity bias
      may be due to better access to the positive remote memory details than the
      negative remote memory details.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The association of periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) with
      posterior fossa cyst (PFC) is documented after birth. We report this association 
      in a series of fetuses. METHODS: Eleven cases (7 females) of PVNH and PFC
      diagnosed at prenatal imaging were collected in this retrospective multicenter
      study. The patients were referred to tertiary centers for targeted
      ultrasonography (US) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) following detection of 
      PFC on routine US. Mutations of the filamin A gene (FLNA) were searched for (n = 
      6). Maternal brain MRI was performed (n = 8). Post-mortem or postnatal data were 
      recorded. RESULTS: Targeted US was performed at a mean gestational age of 29
      (range; 23-35) weeks and identified PVNH in 4 cases. At MRI, performed at a mean 
      gestational age of 31 (range; 29-35) weeks, PVNH and PFC were visible in all
      cases. Those findings were confirmed by postnatal MRI (n = 3), autopsy (n = 7)
      and/or post-mortem MRI (n = 2) or US (n = 1). Maternal brain MRI showed PVNH in
      one case. A de novo FLNA mutation was found in four cases. CONCLUSION: We
      describe a series of PVNH and PFC in fetuses, which underlines the importance of 
      searching for PVNH when PFC is identified at prenatal US. (c) 2014 John Wiley &

AB  - According to the cross-stressor adaptation hypothesis, physically trained
      individuals show lower physiological and psychological responses to stressors
      other than exercise, e.g. psychosocial stress. Reduced stress reactivity may
      constitute a mechanism of action for the beneficial effects of exercise in
      maintaining mental health. With regard to neural and psychoneuroendocrine stress 
      responses, the acute stress-buffering effects of exercise have not been
      investigated yet. A sample of highly trained (HT) and sedentary (SED) young men
      was randomized to either exercise on a treadmill at moderate intensity (60-70%
      VO2max; AER) for 30 min, or to perform 30 min of "placebo" exercise (PLAC). 90
      min later, an fMRI experiment was conducted using an adapted version of the
      Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST). The subjective and psychoneuroendocrine
      (cortisol and alpha-amylase) changes induced by the exercise intervention and the
      MIST were assessed, as well as neural activations during the MIST. Finally,
      associations between the different stress responses were analysed. Participants
      of the AER group showed a significantly reduced cortisol response to the MIST,
      which was inversely related to the previous exercise-induced alpha-amylase and
      cortisol fluctuations. With regard to the sustained BOLD signal, we found higher 
      bilateral hippocampus (Hipp) activity and lower prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity 
      in the AER group. Participants with a higher aerobic fitness showed lower
      cortisol responses to the MIST. As the Hipp and PFC are brain structures
      prominently involved in the regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal
      (HPA) axis, these findings indicate that the acute stress-buffering effect of
      exercise relies on negative feedback mechanisms. Positive affective changes after
      exercise appear as important moderators largely accounting for the effects
      related to physical fitness.

AB  - Gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) is the primary method of choice in
      functional MRI and other methods relying on fast MRI to image brain activation
      and connectivity. However, the high susceptibility of EPI towards B0 magnetic
      field inhomogeneity poses serious challenges. Conventional magnetic field
      shimming with low-order spherical harmonic (SH) functions is capable of
      compensating shallow field distortions, but performs poorly for global brain
      shimming or on specific areas with strong susceptibility-induced B0 distortions
      such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Excellent B0 homogeneity has been
      demonstrated recently in the human brain at 7 Tesla with the DYNAmic Multi-coIl
      TEchnique (DYNAMITE) for magnetic field shimming (J Magn Reson (2011)
      212:280-288). Here, we report the benefits of DYNAMITE shimming for multi-slice
      EPI and T2* mapping. A standard deviation of 13Hz was achieved for the residual
      B0 distribution in the human brain at 7 Tesla with DYNAMITE shimming and was 60% 
      lower compared to conventional shimming that employs static zero through third
      order SH shapes. The residual field inhomogeneity with SH shimming led to an
      average 8mm shift at acquisition parameters commonly used for fMRI and was
      reduced to 1.5-3mm with DYNAMITE shimming. T2* values obtained from the
      prefrontal and temporal cortices with DYNAMITE shimming were 10-50% longer than
      those measured with SH shimming. The reduction of the confounding macroscopic B0 
      field gradients with DYNAMITE shimming thereby promises improved access to the
      relevant microscopic T2* effects. The combination of high spatial resolution and 
      DYNAMITE shimming allows largely artifact-free EPI and T2* mapping throughout the
      brain, including prefrontal and temporal lobe areas. DYNAMITE shimming is
      expected to critically benefit a wide range of MRI applications that rely on
      excellent B0 magnetic field conditions including EPI-based fMRI to study various 
      cognitive processes and assessing large-scale brain connectivity in vivo. As
      such, DYNAMITE shimming has the potential to replace conventional SH shim systems
      in human MR scanners.

AB  - Cognitive reappraisal has been associated with increased activation in prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) and cingulate regions implicated in cognitive control and affect
      regulation. To date, neuroimaging studies of reappraisal have primarily used
      emotionally evocative scenes, and it remains unclear whether the same cognitive
      strategy applied to emotional facial expressions would involve similar or
      different neural underpinnings. The present study used fMRI to examine brain
      activation during cognitive reappraisal of negatively valenced facial expressions
      relative to passive viewing of negative and neutral facial expressions.
      Twenty-two healthy adults completed a cognitive reappraisal task comprised of
      three different conditions (Look-Neutral, Maintain-Negative,
      Reappraise-Negative). Results indicated that reappraisal was associated with a
      decrease in negative affect and engagement of PFC brain regions implicated in
      cognitive control and affect regulation (DLPFC, mPFC, and VLPFC). Furthermore,
      individual differences in habitual reappraisal use were associated with greater
      DLPFC and mPFC activation, while suppression use was associated with greater
      amygdala activation. The present study provides preliminary evidence that facial 
      expressions are effective alternative 'targets' of prefrontal engagement during
      cognitive reappraisal. These findings are particularly relevant for future
      research probing the neural bases of emotion regulation in populations for whom
      aversive scenes may be less appropriate (e.g., children) and illnesses in which
      aberrant responses to social signals of threat and negative feedback are cardinal
      phenotypes.

TI  - Functional compensation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex improves
      memory-dependent decisions in older adults.
PG  - 15648-57

AB  - Everyday consumer choices frequently involve memory, as when we retrieve
      information about consumer products when making purchasing decisions. In this
      context, poor memory may affect decision quality, particularly in individuals
      with memory decline, such as older adults. However, age differences in choice
      behavior may be reduced if older adults can recruit additional neural resources
      that support task performance. Although such functional compensation is well
      documented in other cognitive domains, it is presently unclear whether it can
      support memory-guided decision making and, if so, which brain regions play a role
      in compensation. The current study engaged younger and older humans in a
      memory-dependent choice task in which pairs of consumer products from a popular
      online-shopping site were evaluated with different delays between the first and
      second product. Using functional imaging (fMRI), we found that the ventromedial
      prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) supports compensation as defined by three a priori
      criteria: (1) increased vmPFC activation was observed in older versus younger
      adults; (2) age-related increases in vmPFC activity were associated with
      increased retrieval demands; and (3) increased vmPFC activity was positively
      associated with performance in older adults-evidence of successful compensation. 
      Extending these results, we observed evidence for compensation in connectivity
      between vmPFC and the dorsolateral PFC during memory-dependent choice. In
      contrast, we found no evidence for age differences in value-related processing or
      age-related compensation for choices without delayed retrieval. Together, these
      results converge on the conclusion that age-related decline in memory-dependent
      choice performance can be minimized via functional compensation in vmPFC.

TI  - fNIRS suggests increased effort during executive access in ecstasy polydrug
      users.
PG  - 1571-82
LID - 10.1007/s00213-014-3795-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ecstasy use is associated with cognitive impairment, believed to
      result from damage to 5-HT axons. Neuroimaging techniques to investigate
      executive dysfunction in ecstasy users provide a more sensitive measure of
      cognitive impairment than behavioural indicators. The present study assessed
      executive access to semantic memory in ecstasy polydrug users and non-users.
      METHODS: Twenty ecstasy polydrug users and 20 non-user controls completed an oral
      variant of the Chicago Word Fluency Test (CWFT), whilst the haemodynamic response
      to the task was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
      RESULTS: There were no between-group differences in many background measures
      including measures of sleep and mood state (anxiety, arousal, hedonic tone). No
      behavioural differences were observed on the CWFT. However, there were
      significant differences in oxy-Hb level change at several voxels relating to the 
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and right medial prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) during the CWFT, indicating increased cognitive effort in ecstasy users
      relative to controls. Regression analyses showed that frequency of ecstasy use,
      total lifetime dose and amount used in the last 30 days was significant
      predictors of oxy-Hb increase at several voxels after controlling for alcohol and
      cannabis use indices. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that ecstasy users show
      increased activation in the PFC as a compensatory mechanism, to achieve
      equivalent performance to non-users. These findings are in agreement with much of
      the literature in the area which suggests that ecstasy may be a selective
      serotonin neurotoxin in humans.

TI  - Amygdala and Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Connectivity during an Emotional Working
      Memory Task in Borderline Personality Disorder Patients with Interpersonal Trauma
      History.
PG  - 848

AB  - Working memory is critically involved in ignoring emotional distraction while
      maintaining goal-directed behavior. Antagonistic interactions between brain
      regions implicated in emotion processing, e.g., amygdala, and brain regions
      involved in cognitive control, e.g., dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal
      cortex (dlPFC, dmPFC), may play an important role in coping with emotional
      distraction. We previously reported prolonged reaction times associated with
      amygdala hyperreactivity during emotional distraction in interpersonally
      traumatized borderline personality disorder (BPD) patients compared to healthy
      controls (HC): Participants performed a working memory task, while neutral versus
      negative distractors (interpersonal scenes from the International Affective
      Picture System) were presented. Here, we re-analyzed data from this study using
      psychophysiological interaction analysis. The bilateral amygdala and bilateral
      dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were defined as seed regions of interest.
      Whole-brain regression analyses with reaction times and self-reported increase of
      dissociation were performed. During emotional distraction, reduced amygdala
      connectivity with clusters in the left dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC was
      observed in the whole group. Compared to HC, BPD patients showed a stronger
      coupling of both seeds with a cluster in the right dmPFC and stronger positive
      amygdala connectivity with bilateral (para)hippocampus. Patients further
      demonstrated stronger positive dACC connectivity with left posterior cingulate,
      insula, and frontoparietal regions during emotional distraction. Reaction times
      positively predicted amygdala connectivity with right dmPFC and
      (para)hippocampus, while dissociation positively predicted amygdala connectivity 
      with right ACC during emotional distraction in patients. Our findings suggest
      increased attention to task-irrelevant (emotional) social information during a
      working memory task in interpersonally traumatized patients with BPD.

PG  - 455-62
LID - 10.1016/j.nicl.2014.10.008 [doi]
AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have been used to quantitatively
      assess focal and network abnormalities. Idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) is 
      characterized by bilateral synchronous spike-wave discharges on
      electroencephalography (EEG) but normal clinical MRI. Dysfunctions involving the 
      neocortex, particularly the prefrontal cortex, and thalamus likely contribute to 
      seizure activity. To identify possible morphometric and functional differences in
      the brains of IGE patients and normal controls, we employed measures of thalamic 
      volumes, cortical thickness, gray-white blurring, fractional anisotropy (FA)
      measures from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fractional amplitude of low
      frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in thalamic subregions from resting state
      functional MRI. Data from 27 patients with IGE and 27 age- and sex-matched
      controls showed similar thalamic volumes, cortical thickness and gray-white
      contrast. There were no differences in FA values on DTI in tracts connecting the 
      thalamus and prefrontal cortex. Functional analysis revealed decreased fALFF in
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) subregion of the thalamus in patients with IGE. We
      provide minimum detectable effect sizes for each measure used in the study. Our
      analysis indicates that fMRI-based methods are more sensitive than quantitative
      structural techniques for characterizing brain abnormalities in IGE.

      muscle sympathetic nerve activity in obstructive sleep apnoea.
PG  - 275-83
LID - 10.1016/j.nicl.2014.08.021 [doi]
AB  - Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) is greatly elevated in patients with
      obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) during daytime wakefulness, leading to
      hypertension, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. By recording
      MSNA concurrently with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of the brain 
      we aimed to identify the central processes responsible for the
      sympathoexcitation. Spontaneous fluctuations in MSNA were recorded via tungsten
      microelectrodes inserted percutaneously into the common peroneal nerve in 17 OSA 
      patients and 15 healthy controls lying in a 3 T MRI scanner. Blood Oxygen Level
      Dependent (BOLD) contrast gradient echo, echo-planar images were continuously
      collected in a 4 s ON, 4 s OFF (200 volumes) sampling protocol. Fluctuations in
      BOLD signal intensity covaried with the intensity of the concurrently recorded
      bursts of MSNA. In both groups there was a positive correlation between MSNA and 
      signal intensity in the left and right insulae, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (dlPFC), dorsal precuneus, sensorimotor cortex and posterior temporal cortex, and
      the right mid-cingulate cortex and hypothalamus. In OSA the left and right dlPFC,
      medial PFC (mPFC), dorsal precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex, retrosplenial
      cortex and caudate nucleus showed augmented signal changes compared with
      controls, while the right hippocampus/parahippocampus signal intensity decreased 
      in controls but did not change in the OSA subjects. In addition, there were
      significant increases in grey matter volume in the left mid-insula, the right
      insula, left and right primary motor cortices, left premotor cortex, left
      hippocampus and within the brainstem and cerebellum, and significant decreases in
      the mPFC, occipital lobe, right posterior cingulate cortex, left cerebellar
      cortex and the left and right amygdala in OSA, but there was no overlap between
      these structural changes and the functional changes in OSA. These data suggest
      that the elevated muscle vasoconstrictor drive in OSA may result from functional 
      changes within these brain regions, which are known to be directly or indirectly 
      involved in the modulation of sympathetic outflow via the brainstem. That there
      was no overlap in the structural and functional changes suggests that asphyxic
      damage due to repeated episodes of nocturnal obstructive apnoea is not the main
      cause of the sympathoexcitation.

      intra-subject variability in efficiency. Thus, the present study was designed to 
      identify brain regions involved in intra-subject variability in cognitive
      efficiency via participant-level correlations between trial-level reaction time
      (RT) and trial-level fMRI BOLD percent signal change on a processing speed task. 
      On each trial, participants indicated whether a digit-symbol probe-pair was
      present or absent in an array of nine digit-symbol probe-pairs while fMRI data
      were collected. Deconvolution analyses, using RT time-series models (derived from
      the proportional scaling of an event-related hemodynamic response function model 
      by trial-level RT), were used to evaluate relationships between trial-level RTs
      and BOLD percent signal change. Although task-related patterns of activation and 
      deactivation were observed in regions including bilateral occipital, bilateral
      parietal, portions of the medial wall such as the precuneus, default mode network
      regions including anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, bilateral temporal,
      right cerebellum, and right cuneus, RT-BOLD correlations were observed in a more 
      circumscribed set of regions. Positive RT-BOLD correlations, where fast RTs were 
      associated with lower BOLD percent signal change, were observed in regions
      including bilateral occipital, bilateral parietal, and the precuneus. RT-BOLD
      correlations were not observed in the default mode network indicating a smaller
      set of regions associated with intra-subject variability in cognitive efficiency.
      The results are discussed in terms of a distributed area of regions that mediate 
      variability in the cognitive efficiency that might underlie processing speed
      differences between individuals.

AB  - Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has been used to investigate 
      intrinsic brain connectivity in healthy subjects and patients with chronic pain. 
      Sex-related differences in the frequency power distribution within the human
      insula (INS), a brain region involved in the integration of interoceptive,
      affective, and cognitive influences, have been reported. Here we aimed to test
      sex and disease-related alterations in the intrinsic functional connectivity of
      the dorsal anterior INS. The anterior INS is engaged during goal-directed tasks
      and modulates the default mode and executive control networks. By comparing
      functional connectivity of the dorsal anterior INS in age-matched female and male
      healthy subjects and patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common
      chronic abdominal pain condition, we show evidence for sex and disease-related
      alterations in the functional connectivity of this region: (1) male patients
      compared with female patients had increased positive connectivity of the dorsal
      anterior INS bilaterally with the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsal
      posterior INS; (2) female patients compared with male patients had greater
      negative connectivity of the left dorsal anterior INS with the left precuneus;
      (3) disease-related differences in the connectivity between the bilateral dorsal 
      anterior INS and the dorsal medial PFC were observed in female subjects; and (4) 
      clinical characteristics were significantly correlated to the insular
      connectivity with the dorsal medial PFC in male IBS subjects and with the
      precuneus in female IBS subjects. These findings are consistent with the INS
      playing an important role in modulating the intrinsic functional connectivity of 
      major networks in the resting brain and show that this role is influenced by sex 
      and diagnosis.

TI  - Neural signatures of fairness-related normative decision making in the ultimatum 
      game: a coordinate-based meta-analysis.
PG  - 591-602

AB  - The willingness to incur personal costs to enforce prosocial norms represents a
      hallmark of human civilization. Although recent neuroscience studies have used
      the ultimatum game to understand the neuropsychological mechanisms that underlie 
      the enforcement of fairness norms; however, a precise characterization of the
      neural systems underlying fairness-related norm enforcement remains elusive. In
      this study, we used a coordinate-based meta-analysis on functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using the ultimatum game with the goal to
      provide an additional level of evidence for the refinement of the underlying
      neural architecture of this human puzzling behavior. Our results demonstrated a
      convergence of reported activation foci in brain networks associated with
      psychological components of fairness-related normative decision making,
      presumably reflecting a reflexive and intuitive system (System 1) and a
      reflective and deliberate system (System 2). System 1 (anterior insula,
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex [PFC]) may be associated with the reflexive and
      intuitive responses to norm violations, representing a motivation to punish norm 
      violators. Those intuitive responses conflict with economic self-interest,
      encoded in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which may engage cognitive
      control from a reflective and deliberate System 2 to resolve the conflict by
      either suppressing (ventrolateral PFC, dorsomedial PFC, left dorsolateral PFC,
      and rostral ACC) the intuitive responses or over-riding self-interest (right
      dorsolateral PFC). Taken together, we suggest that fairness-related norm
      enforcement recruits an intuitive system for rapid evaluation of norm violations 
      and a deliberate system for integrating both social norms and self-interest to
      regulate the intuitive system in favor of more flexible decision making.

AB  - Neurobiological memory models assume memory traces are stored in neocortex, with 
      pointers in the hippocampus, and are then reactivated during retrieval, yielding 
      the experience of remembering. Whereas most prior neuroimaging studies on
      reactivation have focused on the reactivation of sets or categories of items, the
      current study sought to identify cortical patterns pertaining to memory for
      individual scenes. During encoding, participants viewed pictures of scenes paired
      with matching labels (e.g., "barn," "tunnel"), and, during retrieval, they
      recalled the scenes in response to the labels and rated the quality of their
      visual memories. Using representational similarity analyses, we interrogated the 
      similarity between activation patterns during encoding and retrieval both at the 
      item level (individual scenes) and the set level (all scenes). The study yielded 
      four main findings. First, in occipitotemporal cortex, memory success increased
      with encoding-retrieval similarity (ERS) at the item level but not at the set
      level, indicating the reactivation of individual scenes. Second, in ventrolateral
      pFC, memory increased with ERS for both item and set levels, indicating the
      recapitulation of memory processes that benefit encoding and retrieval of all
      scenes. Third, in retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortex, ERS was sensitive to 
      individual scene information irrespective of memory success, suggesting automatic
      activation of scene contexts. Finally, consistent with neurobiological models,
      hippocampal activity during encoding predicted the subsequent reactivation of
      individual items. These findings show the promise of studying memory with greater
      specificity by isolating individual mnemonic representations and determining
      their relationship to factors like the detail with which past events are
      remembered.

AB  - The attention system functionally modulates brain activity to exert control over 
      thoughts, feelings and actions. Three distinct but mutually interacting
      components of attention have been hypothesized: alerting, which mediates the
      maintenance of a state of vigilance toward an upcoming stimulus; orienting, which
      supports the selection of sensory information, and executive control that is
      involved in detecting and resolving cognitive conflicts. The performance of tasks
      probing these components engages fronto-parietal and thalamic regions. Also,
      general attention has been associated with the activity of resting-state networks
      (RSNs), which are sets of brain regions with synchronous temporal fluctuations.
      Importantly, the association between the intrinsic brain activity of RSNs and the
      efficiency and integration of the specific attentional components remains largely
      unexplored. For this aim, we recruited twenty healthy volunteers who performed
      the Attention Network Test-Revised (ANT-R), assessing the alerting, orienting and
      executive control components as well as their interactions, and underwent
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. For each participant RSNs
      were estimated using double regression. The RSNs spanning across areas previously
      implicated in attentional processing were correlated with ANT-R scores using
      multiple regressions. Significant brain behavior correlations emerged between
      ANT-R scores and RSNs comprising the regions relevant for attentional processing,
      i.e., left and right prefronto-parietal (PFC-PC), dorsal attentional (DAN),
      salience (SN), and default mode (DMN) networks. The activity of PFC-PC networks
      was correlated with alerting in parietal and frontal regions, and with location
      conflict in the frontal regions. The DAN connectivity was correlated with
      flanker, location conflict, and their interaction in parietal regions. SN was
      associated with flanker by location and flanker by orienting interactions in the 
      inferior frontal regions. Finally, the activity of the DMN was associated with
      flanker conflict in midline structures such as precuneus and anterior cingulate
      cortex and also in right angular gyrus. These results suggest that the brain is
      endowed with an intrinsic functional organization to support attention, not only 
      in its global function, but also in its distinct components.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is widely held that single cells in anterior cingulate and lateral
      prefrontal cortex (ACC/PFC) coordinate their activity during attentional
      processes, although cellular activity that may underlie such coordination across 
      ACC/PFC has not been identified. We thus recorded cells in five ACC/PFC subfields
      of macaques engaged in a selective attention task, characterized those spiking
      events that indexed attention, and identified how spiking of distinct cell
      populations synchronized between brain areas. RESULTS: We found that cells in
      ACC/PFC increased the firing of brief 200 Hz spike bursts when subjects shifted
      attention and engaged in selective visual processing. In contrast to nonburst
      spikes, burst spikes synchronized over large distances to local field potentials 
      at narrow beta (12-20 Hz) and at gamma (50-75 Hz) frequencies. Long-range burst
      synchronization was anatomically specific, functionally connecting those
      subfields in area 24 (ACC) and area 46 (PFC) that are key players of attentional 
      control. By splitting cells into putative excitatory (pE) and inhibitory (pI)
      cells by their broad and narrow spikes, we identified that bursts of pI cells
      preceded and that bursts of pE cells followed in time periods of maximal beta
      coherent network activity. In contrast, gamma bursts were transient impulses with
      equal timing across cell classes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that
      processes underlying burst firing and burst synchronization are candidate
      mechanisms to coordinate attention information across brain areas. We speculate
      that distinct burst-firing motifs realize beta and gamma synchrony to trigger
      versus maintain functional network states during goal-directed behavior.

AB  - Our emotions tend to be directed towards someone or something. Such emotional
      intentionality calls for the integration between two streams of information;
      abstract hedonic value and its associated concrete content. In a previous
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we found that the combination 
      of these two streams, as modeled by short emotional music excerpts and neutral
      film clips, was associated with synergistic activation in both temporal-limbic
      (TL) and ventral-lateral PFC (vLPFC) regions. This additive effect implies the
      integration of domain-specific 'affective' and 'cognitive' processes. Yet, the
      low temporal resolution of the fMRI limits the characterization of such
      cross-domain integration. To this end, we complemented the fMRI data with
      intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings from twelve patients with
      intractable epilepsy. As expected, the additive fMRI activation in the amygdala
      and vLPFC was associated with distinct spatio-temporal iEEG patterns among
      electrodes situated within the vicinity of the fMRI activation foci. On the one
      hand, TL channels exhibited a transient (0-500 msec) increase in gamma power
      (61-69 Hz), possibly reflecting initial relevance detection or hedonic value
      tagging. On the other hand, vLPFC channels showed sustained (1-12 sec)
      suppression of low frequency power (2.3-24 Hz), possibly mediating changes in
      gating, enabling an on-going readiness for content-based processing of
      emotionally tagged signals. Moreover, an additive effect in delta-gamma
      phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) was found among the TL channels, possibly
      reflecting the integration between distinct domain specific processes. Together, 
      this study provides a multi-faceted neurophysiological signature for computations
      that possibly underlie emotional intentionality in humans.

AB  - The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in attending to one's own
      emotional states, but the role of emotional valence in this context is not
      understood. We examined valence-specific BOLD activity in a previously validated 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. Ten healthy subjects
      viewed emotional pictures and categorized their experience as pleasant,
      unpleasant or neutral. All three categories activated a common region within
      mPFC. Subtraction of neutral from pleasant or unpleasant conditions instead
      revealed ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), suggesting that this region represents
      emotional valence. During exteroceptive attention, greater mPFC responses were
      observed in response to emotional relative to neutral stimuli, consistent with
      studies implicating mPFC in the top-down modulation of emotion-biased attention. 
      These findings may help to integrate the two proposed roles of mPFC in emotional 
      representation and top-down modulation of subcortical structures.

AB  - Both acute and chronic exercise is consistently associated with a number of
      benefits to physical and mental health, including cardiovascular function, body
      weight, mood, and cognition. Near-infrared spectroscopy is an ideal method to
      measure changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb and dHb) levels
      in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during exercise, to better understand the locus of
      such changes in affective and cognitive processes. The present study tracked
      time-dependent changes in O2Hb and dHb levels in the PFC as a function of
      parametrically manipulated target exercise intensity. Near-infrared spectroscopy 
      was conducted as regular exercisers completed a 30-min bout of exercise with one 
      of three target intensities: 52% (low condition), 68% (moderate condition), or
      84% (high condition) of age-adjusted maximum heart rate. Heart rate data
      confirmed that the participants reached their goal intensities immediately, after
      10 min, or after 20 min, respectively. Data showed that O2Hb and dHb levels in
      the PFC increased as a function of both exercise load and duration. An
      84%>68%>52% difference was evident after 18 min of cycling for O2Hb and after 23 
      min of cycling for dHb. The present results add to the growing body of literature
      showing that at submaximal levels, increasing exercise intensities reliably
      promote prefrontal cerebral oxygenation.

AB  - Nelson and Narens have proposed a metacognition model that dissociates the
      objective processing of information (object-level) and the subjective evaluation 
      of the performance (i.e., the metalevel). Neurophysiological evidence also
      indicates that the prefrontal cortices (PFC) are the brain areas which perform
      the metalevel function [1]-[3]. A corresponding neural mechanism of Nelson and
      Narens's model, called dynamic filtering theory [4], [5], indicates that
      object-level processing is distributed in the posterior cortices and regulated by
      the prefrontal cortices with a filtering or gating mechanism to select
      appropriate signals and suppress inappropriate signals and noise. Based on this
      model, a hypothesis can be developed that, in the case of uncertainty or
      overloading of object-level processing, the prefrontal cortices will become more 
      active in order to modulate signals and noise. This hypothesis is supported by a 
      recent fMRI study [6] showing that the PFC (Brodmann area 9, BA9) was activated
      when subjects were overloaded in a bimodal attentional task, compared to a
      unimodal task. Here, we report a study showing that applying repetitive
      transmagnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the BA9 in order to interfere with its
      functional activity resulted in significant increas in guessed responses,
      compared to three other control conditions (i.e., no-TMS, sham TMS on BA9, and
      rTMS on Cz). The results are compatible with the dynamic filtering theory and
      suggest that a malfunction of the PFC would weaken the quality of meta-cognitive 
      percepts and increase the number of guessed responses.

AB  - For more than 50 years, psychologists and neuroscientists have recognized the
      importance of a working memory to coordinate processing when multiple goals are
      active and to guide behavior with information that is not present in the
      immediate environment. In recent years, psychological theory and cognitive
      neuroscience data have converged on the idea that information is encoded into
      working memory by allocating attention to internal representations, whether
      semantic long-term memory (e.g., letters, digits, words), sensory, or motoric.
      Thus, information-based multivariate analyses of human functional MRI data
      typically find evidence for the temporary representation of stimuli in regions
      that also process this information in nonworking memory contexts. The prefrontal 
      cortex (PFC), on the other hand, exerts control over behavior by biasing the
      salience of mnemonic representations and adjudicating among competing,
      context-dependent rules. The "control of the controller" emerges from a complex
      interplay between PFC and striatal circuits and ascending dopaminergic
      neuromodulatory signals.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies report increased right prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      involvement during verbal memory tasks amongst low-scoring older individuals,
      compared to younger controls and their higher-scoring contemporaries. Some
      propose that this reflects inefficient use of neural resources through failure of
      the left PFC to inhibit non-task-related right PFC activity, via the anterior
      corpus callosum (CC). For others, it indicates partial compensation - that is,
      the right PFC cannot completely supplement the failing neural network, but
      contributes positively to performance. We propose that combining structural and
      diffusion brain MRI can be used to test predictions from these theories which
      have arisen from fMRI studies. We test these hypotheses in immediate and delayed 
      verbal memory ability amongst 90 healthy older adults of mean age 73 years. Right
      hippocampus and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) volumes, and
      fractional anisotropy (FA) in the splenium made unique contributions to verbal
      memory ability in the whole group. There was no significant effect of anterior
      callosal white matter integrity on performance. Rather, segmented linear
      regression indicated that right DLPFC volume was a significantly stronger
      positive predictor of verbal memory for lower-scorers than higher-scorers,
      supporting a compensatory explanation for the differential involvement of the
      right frontal lobe in verbal memory tasks in older age.

AB  - Animal approach-avoidance conflict paradigms have been used extensively to
      operationalize anxiety, quantify the effects of anxiolytic agents, and probe the 
      neural basis of fear and anxiety. Results from human neuroimaging studies support
      that a frontal-striatal-amygdala neural circuitry is important for
      approach-avoidance learning. However, the neural basis of decision-making is much
      less clear in this context. Thus, we combined a recently developed human
      approach-avoidance paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to 
      identify neural substrates underlying approach-avoidance conflict
      decision-making. Fifteen healthy adults completed the approach-avoidance conflict
      (AAC) paradigm during fMRI. Analyses of variance were used to compare conflict to
      nonconflict (avoid-threat and approach-reward) conditions and to compare level of
      reward points offered during the decision phase. Trial-by-trial amplitude
      modulation analyses were used to delineate brain areas underlying decision-making
      in the context of approach/avoidance behavior. Conflict trials as compared to the
      nonconflict trials elicited greater activation within bilateral anterior
      cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and caudate, as well as right dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). Right caudate and lateral PFC activation was modulated
      by level of reward offered. Individuals who showed greater caudate activation
      exhibited less approach behavior. On a trial-by-trial basis, greater right
      lateral PFC activation related to less approach behavior. Taken together, results
      suggest that the degree of activation within prefrontal-striatal-insula circuitry
      determines the degree of approach versus avoidance decision-making. Moreover, the
      degree of caudate and lateral PFC activation related to individual differences in
      approach-avoidance decision-making. Therefore, the approach-avoidance conflict
      paradigm is ideally suited to probe anxiety-related processing differences during
      approach-avoidance decision-making.

      regulation.

LID - 10.1093/geronb/gbu108 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Successful emotion regulation partly depends on our capacity to
      modulate emotional responses through the use of cognitive strategies. Age may
      affect the strategies employed most often; thus, we examined younger and older
      adults' neural network connectivity when employing two different strategies:
      cognitive reappraisal and selective attention. METHOD: The current study used
      psychophysiological interaction analyses to examine functional connectivity with 
      a region of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) because it is a core part of an
      emotion regulation network showing relative structural preservation with age.
      RESULTS: Functional connectivity between ACC and prefrontal cortex (PFC) was
      greater for reappraisal relative to selective attention and passive viewing
      conditions for both age groups. For younger adults, ACC was more strongly
      connected with lateral dorsolateral PFC, ventrolateral PFC, dorsomedial PFC, and 
      posterior cingulate regions during reappraisal. For older adults, stronger
      connectivity during reappraisal was observed primarily in ventromedial PFC and
      orbitofrontal cortex. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that although young and
      older adults engage PFC networks during regulation, and particularly during
      reappraisal, the regions within these networks might differ. Additionally, these 
      results clarify that, despite prior evidence for age-related declines in the
      structure and function of those regions, older adults are able to recruit ACC and
      PFC regions as part of coherent network during emotion regulation.

      adolescents.
PG  - 387-99
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00698 [doi]
AB  - Converging behavioral evidence indicates that temporal discounting, measured by
      intertemporal choice tasks, is inversely related to intelligence. At the neural
      level, the parieto-frontal network is pivotal for complex, higher-order cognitive
      processes. Relatedly, underrecruitment of the pFC during a working memory task
      has been found to be associated with steeper temporal discounting. Furthermore,
      this network has also been shown to be related to the consistency of
      intertemporal choices. Here we report an fMRI study that directly investigated
      the association of neural correlates of intertemporal choice behavior with
      intelligence in an adolescent sample (n = 206; age 13.7-15.5 years). After
      identifying brain regions where the BOLD response during intertemporal choice was
      correlated with individual differences in intelligence, we further tested whether
      BOLD responses in these areas would mediate the associations between
      intelligence, the discounting rate, and choice consistency. We found positive
      correlations between BOLD response in a value-independent decision network (i.e.,
      dorsolateral pFC, precuneus, and occipital areas) and intelligence. Furthermore, 
      BOLD response in a value-dependent decision network (i.e., perigenual ACC,
      inferior frontal gyrus, ventromedial pFC, ventral striatum) was positively
      correlated with intelligence. The mediation analysis revealed that BOLD responses
      in the value-independent network mediated the association between intelligence
      and choice consistency, whereas BOLD responses in the value-dependent network
      mediated the association between intelligence and the discounting rate. In
      summary, our findings provide evidence for common neural correlates of
      intertemporal choice and intelligence, possibly linked by valuation as well as
      executive functions.

TI  - Neural emotion regulation circuitry underlying anxiolytic effects of perceived
      control over pain.
PG  - 222-33
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00702 [doi]
AB  - Anxiolytic effects of perceived control have been observed across species. In
      humans, neuroimaging studies have suggested that perceived control and cognitive 
      reappraisal reduce negative affect through similar mechanisms. An important
      limitation of extant neuroimaging studies of perceived control in terms of
      directly testing this hypothesis, however, is the use of within-subject designs, 
      which confound participants' affective response to controllable and
      uncontrollable stress. To compare neural and affective responses when
      participants were exposed to either uncontrollable or controllable stress, two
      groups of participants received an identical series of stressors (thermal pain
      stimuli). One group ("controllable") was led to believe they had behavioral
      control over the pain stimuli, whereas another ("uncontrollable") believed they
      had no control. Controllable pain was associated with decreased state anxiety,
      decreased activation in amygdala, and increased activation in nucleus accumbens. 
      In participants who perceived control over the pain, reduced state anxiety was
      associated with increased functional connectivity between each of these regions
      and ventral lateral/ventral medial pFC. The location of pFC findings is
      consistent with regions found to be critical for the anxiolytic effects of
      perceived control in rodents. Furthermore, interactions observed between pFC and 
      both amygdala and nucleus accumbens are remarkably similar to neural mechanisms
      of emotion regulation through reappraisal in humans. These results suggest that
      perceived control reduces negative affect through a general mechanism involved in
      the cognitive regulation of emotion.

TI  - Person-specific theory of mind in medial pFC.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00700 [doi]
AB  - Although research on theory of mind has strongly implicated the dorsomedial pFC
      (incuding medial BA 8 and BA 9), the unique contributions of medial pFC (MPFC;
      corresponding to medial BA 10) to mentalizing remain uncertain. The extant
      literature has considered the possibility that these regions may be specialized
      for self-related cognition or for reasoning about close others, but evidence for 
      both accounts has been inconclusive. We propose a novel theoretical framework:
      MPFC selectively implements "person-specific theories of mind" (ToMp)
      representing the unique, idiosyncratic traits or attributes of well-known
      individuals. To test this hypothesis, we used fMRI to assess MPFC responses in
      Democratic and Republican participants as they evaluated more or less
      subjectively well-known political figures. Consistent with the ToMp account, MPFC
      showed greater activity to subjectively well-known targets, irrespective of
      participants' reported feelings of closeness or similarity. MPFC also
      demonstrated greater activity on trials in which targets (whether politicians or 
      oneself) were judged to be relatively idiosyncratic, making a generic theory of
      mind inapplicable. These results suggest that MPFC may supplement the generic
      theory of mind process, with which dorsomedial pFC has been associated, by
      contributing mentalizing capacities tuned to individuated representations of
      specific well-known others.

TI  - Schema representation in patients with ventromedial PFC lesions.
PG  - 12057-70
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0740-14.2014 [doi]
AB  - Human neuroimaging and animal studies have recently implicated the ventromedial
      prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in memory schema, particularly in facilitating new
      encoding by existing schemas. In humans, the most conspicuous memory disorder
      following vmPFC damage is confabulation; strategic retrieval models suggest that 
      aberrant schema activation or reinstatement plays a role in confabulation. This
      raises the possibility that beyond its role in schema-supported memory encoding, 
      the vmPFC is also implicated in schema reinstatement itself. If that is the case,
      vmPFC lesions should lead to impaired schema-based operations, even on tasks that
      do not involve memory acquisition. To test this prediction, ten patients with
      vmPFC damage, four with present or prior confabulation, and a group of twelve
      matched healthy controls made speeded yes/no decisions as to whether words were
      closely related to a schema (a visit to the doctor). Ten minutes later, they
      repeated the task for a new schema (going to bed) with some words related to the 
      first schema included as lures. Last, they rated the degree to which stimuli were
      related to the second schema. All four vmPFC patients with present or prior
      confabulation were impaired in rejecting lures and in classifying stimulus
      belongingness to the schema, even when they were not lures. Nonconfabulating
      patients performed comparably to healthy adults with high accuracy, comparable
      reaction times, and similar ratings. These results show for the first time that
      damage to the human vmPFC, when associated with confabulation, leads to deficient
      schema reinstatement, which is likely a prerequisite for schema-mediated memory
      integration.

TI  - Neural correlates of gender differences in reputation building.
PG  - e106285
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0106285 [doi]
AB  - Gender differences in cooperative choices and their neural correlates were
      investigated in a situation where reputation represented a crucial issue. Males
      and females were involved in an economic exchange (trust game) where economic and
      reputational payoffs had to be balanced in order to increase personal welfare. At
      the behavioral level, females showed a stronger reaction to negative reputation
      judgments that led to higher cooperation than males, measured by back transfers
      in the game. The neuroanatomical counterpart of this gender difference was found 
      within the reward network (engaged in producing expectations of positive results)
      and reputation-related brain networks, such as the self-control network (engaged 
      in strategically resisting the temptation to defect) and the mentalizing network 
      (engaged in thinking about how one is viewed by others), in which the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the medial (M)PFC respectively play a 
      crucial role. Furthermore, both DLPFC and MPFC activity correlated with the
      amount of back transfer, as well as with the personality dimensions assessed with
      the Big-Five Questionnaire (BFQ-2). Males, according to their greater DLPFC
      recruitment and their higher level of the BFQ-2 subscale of Dominance, were more 
      focused on implementing a profit-maximizing strategy, pursuing this target
      irrespectively of others' judgments. On the contrary, females, according to their
      greater MPFC activity and their lower level of Dominance, were more focused on
      the reputation per se and not on the strategic component of reputation building. 
      These findings shed light on the sexual dimorphism related to cooperative
      behavior and its neural correlates.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC), a cortical region that was once thought to be
      functionally insignificant, is now known to play an essential role in the
      organization and control of goal-directed thought and behavior. Neuroimaging,
      neurophysiological, and modeling techniques have led to tremendous advances in
      our understanding of PFC functions over the last few decades. It should be noted,
      however, that neurological, neuropathological, and neuropsychological studies
      have contributed some of the most essential, historical, and often prescient
      conclusions regarding the functions of this region. Importantly, examination of
      patients with brain damage allows one to draw conclusions about whether a brain
      area is necessary for a particular function. Here, we provide a broad overview of
      PFC functions based on behavioral and neural changes resulting from damage to PFC
      in both human patients and nonhuman primates.

AB  - It is widely assumed that cognitive functions decline with age and that these
      decrements are associated with age-related changes in patterns of functional
      activity. However, these functional changes may be due to age-related increased
      responsiveness to task demands and not to other cognitive processes on which
      neural and behavioural responses rely, since many ageing studies use task
      paradigms that may not be orthogonal to the cognitive function being
      investigated. Here we test this hypothesis in adults aged 20-86 years by
      combining measures of language comprehension, functional connectivity and neural 
      integrity to identify functional networks activated in two language experiments
      with varying task demands. In one, participants listened to spoken sentences
      without performing an overt task (the natural listening condition) while in the
      other they performed a task in response to the same sentences. Using task-based
      ICA of fMRI, we identified a left-lateralised frontotemporal network associated
      with syntactic analysis, which remained consistently activated regardless of task
      demands. In contrast, in the task condition only a separate set of components
      showed task-specific activity in Opercular, Frontoparietal, and bilateral PFC.
      Only the PFC showed age-related increases in activation which, furthermore, was
      strongly mediated by grey matter health. These results suggest that, contrary to 
      prevailing views, age-related changes in cognitive activation may be due in part 
      to differential responses to task-related processes.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of affective picture processing revealed by intracranial 
      high-gamma modulations.
PG  - 16-28
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22609 [doi]
AB  - Our comprehension of the neural mechanisms underlying emotional information
      processing has largely benefited from noninvasive electrophysiological and
      functional neuroimaging techniques in recent years. However, the spatiotemporal
      dynamics of the neural events occurring during emotional processing remain
      imprecise due to the limited combination of spatial and temporal resolution
      provided by these techniques. This study examines the modulations of
      high-frequency activity of intracranial electroencephalography recordings
      associated with affective picture valence, in epileptic patients awaiting
      neurosurgery. Recordings were obtained from subdural grids and depth electrodes
      in eight patients while they viewed a series of unpleasant, pleasant and neutral 
      pictures from the International Affective Picture System. Broadband high-gamma
      (70-150 Hz) power was computed for separate 100-ms time windows and compared
      according to ratings of emotional valence. Compared to emotionally neutral or
      pleasant pictures, unpleasant stimuli were associated with an early and
      long-lasting ( approximately 200-1,000 ms) bilateral increase in high-gamma
      activity in visual areas of the occipital and temporal lobes, together with a
      late and transient ( approximately 500-800 ms) decrease found bilaterally in the 
      lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Pleasant pictures were associated with increased
      gamma activity in the occipital cortex, compared to the emotionally neutral
      stimuli. Consistent with previous studies, our results provide direct evidence of
      emotion-related modulations in the visual ventral pathway during picture
      processing. Results in the lateral PFC also shed light on the neural mechanisms
      underlying its role in negative emotions processing. This study demonstrates the 
      utility of intracranial high-gamma modulations to study emotional process with a 
      high spatiotemporal precision.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to play an important role in "higher"
      brain functions such as personality and emotion that may associated with several 
      gender-related mental disorders. In this study, the gender effects of functional 
      connectivity, cortical lateralization and significantly differences in the PFC
      were investigated by using resting-state functional optical tomography (fOT)
      measurement. A total of forty subjects including twenty healthy male and twenty
      healthy female adults were recruited for this study. In the results, the
      hemoglobin responses are higher in the male group. Additionally, male group
      exhibited the stronger connectivity in the PFC regions. In the result of
      lateralization, leftward dominant was observed in the male group but bilateral
      dominance in the female group. Finally, the 11 channels of the inferior PFC
      regions (corresponding to the region of Brodmann area 45) are significant
      different with spectrum analysis. Our findings suggest that the resting-state fOT
      method can provide high potential to apply to clinical neuroscience for several
      gender-related mental disorders diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adult posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been characterized by 
      altered fear-network connectivity. Childhood trauma is a major risk factor for
      adult PTSD, yet its contribution to fear-network connectivity in PTSD remains
      unexplored. We examined, within a single model, the contribution of childhood
      maltreatment, combat exposure, and combat-related posttraumatic stress symptoms
      (PTSS) to resting-state connectivity (rs-FC) of the amygdala and hippocampus in
      military veterans. METHODS: Medication-free male veterans (n = 27, average 26.6
      years) with a range of PTSS completed resting-state fMRI. Measures including the 
      Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ),
      and Combat Exposure Scale (CES) were used to predict rs-FC using multilinear
      regression. Fear-network seeds included the amygdala and hippocampus. RESULTS:
      Amygdala: CTQ predicted lower connectivity to ventromedial prefrontal cortex
      (vmPFC), but greater anticorrelation with dorsal/lateral PFC. CAPS positively
      predicted connectivity to insula, and loss of anticorrelation with
      dorsomedial/dorsolateral (dm/dl)PFC. Hippocampus: CTQ predicted lower
      connectivity to vmPFC, but greater anticorrelation with dm/dlPFC. CES predicted
      greater anticorrelation, whereas CAPS predicted less anticorrelation with dmPFC. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Childhood trauma, combat exposure, and PTSS differentially predict
      fear-network rs-FC. Childhood maltreatment may weaken ventral
      prefrontal-subcortical circuitry important in automatic fear regulation, but, in 
      a compensatory manner, may also strengthen dorsal prefrontal-subcortical pathways
      involved in more effortful emotion regulation. PTSD symptoms, in turn, appear to 
      emerge with the loss of connectivity in the latter pathway. These findings
      suggest potential mechanisms by which developmental trauma exposure leads to
      adult PTSD, and which brain mechanisms are associated with the emergence of PTSD 
      symptoms.

AB  - Conditioned changes in the emotional response to threat (e.g. aversive
      unconditioned stimulus; UCS) are mediated in part by the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
      Unpredictable threats elicit large emotional responses, while the response is
      diminished when the threat is predictable. A better understanding of how PFC
      connectivity to other brain regions varies with threat predictability would
      provide important insights into the neural processes that mediate conditioned
      diminution of the emotional response to threat. The present study examined brain 
      connectivity during predictable and unpredictable threat exposure using a fear
      conditioning paradigm (previously published in Wood et al., 2012) in which
      unconditioned functional magnetic resonance imaging data were reanalyzed to
      assess effective connectivity. Granger causality analysis was performed using the
      time series data from 15 activated regions of interest after hemodynamic
      deconvolution, to determine regional effective connectivity. In addition,
      connectivity path weights were correlated with trait anxiety measures to assess
      the relationship between negative affect and brain connectivity. Results indicate
      the dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) serves as a neural hub that influences activity in
      other brain regions when threats are unpredictable. In contrast, the dorsolateral
      PFC (dlPFC) serves as a neural hub that influences the activity of other brain
      regions when threats are predictable. These findings are consistent with the view
      that the dmPFC coordinates brain activity to take action, perhaps in a reactive
      manner, when an unpredicted threat is encountered, while the dlPFC coordinates
      brain regions to take action, in what may be a more proactive manner, to respond 
      to predictable threats. Further, dlPFC connectivity to other brain regions (e.g. 
      ventromedial PFC, amygdala, and insula) varied with negative affect (i.e. trait
      anxiety) when the UCS was predictable, suggesting that stronger connectivity may 
      be required for emotion regulation in individuals with higher levels of negative 
      affect.

TI  - Frontal lobe neurology and the creative mind.
PG  - 761
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00761 [doi]
AB  - Concepts from cognitive neuroscience strongly suggest that the prefrontal cortex 
      (PFC) plays a crucial role in the cognitive functions necessary for creative
      thinking. Functional imaging studies have repeatedly demonstrated the involvement
      of PFC in creativity tasks. Patient studies have demonstrated that frontal damage
      due to focal lesions or neurodegenerative diseases are associated with
      impairments in various creativity tasks. However, against all odds, a series of
      clinical observations has reported the facilitation of artistic production in
      patients with neurodegenerative diseases affecting PFC, such as frontotemporal
      dementia (FTD). An exacerbation of creativity in frontal diseases would challenge
      neuroimaging findings in controls and patients, as well as the theoretical role
      of prefrontal functions in creativity processes. To explore this paradox, we
      reported the history of a FTD patient who exhibited the emergence of visual
      artistic productions during the course of the disease. The patient produced a
      large amount of drawings, which have been evaluated by a group of professional
      artists who were blind to the diagnosis. We also reviewed the published clinical 
      cases reporting a change in the artistic abilities in patients with neurological 
      diseases. We attempted to reconcile these clinical observations to previous
      experimental findings by addressing several questions raised by our review. For
      instance, to what extent can the cognitive, conative, and affective changes
      following frontal damage explain changes in artistic abilities? Does artistic
      exacerbation truly reflect increased creative capacities? These considerations
      could help to clarify the place of creativity-as it has been defined and explored
      by cognitive neuroscience-in artistic creation and may provide leads for future
      lesion studies.

AB  - Cognitive control allows stimulus-response processing to be aligned with internal
      goals and is thus central to intelligent, purposeful behavior. Control is thought
      to depend in part on the active representation of task information in prefrontal 
      cortex (PFC), which provides a source of contextual bias on perception, decision 
      making, and action. In the present study, we investigated the organization,
      influences, and consequences of context representation as human subjects
      performed a cued sorting task that required them to flexibly judge the
      relationship between pairs of multivalent stimuli. Using a connectivity-based
      parcellation of PFC and multivariate decoding analyses, we determined that
      context is specifically and transiently represented in a region spanning the
      inferior frontal sulcus during context-dependent decision making. We also found
      strong evidence that decision context is represented within the intraparietal
      sulcus, an area previously shown to be functionally networked with the inferior
      frontal sulcus at rest and during task performance. Rule-guided allocation of
      attention to different stimulus dimensions produced discriminable patterns of
      activation in visual cortex, providing a signature of top-down bias over
      perception. Furthermore, demands on cognitive control arising from the task
      structure modulated context representation, which was found to be strongest after
      a shift in task rules. When context representation in frontoparietal areas
      increased in strength, as measured by the discriminability of high-dimensional
      activation patterns, the bias on attended stimulus features was enhanced. These
      results provide novel evidence that illuminates the mechanisms by which humans
      flexibly guide behavior in complex environments.

AB  - The human brain is remarkably adept at integrating complex information to form
      unified psychological representations of agents, objects, and events in the
      environment. Two domains in which this ability is particularly salient are the
      processing of social and valence information and are supported by common cortical
      areas in the medial pFC (MPFC). Because social information is often embedded
      within valenced emotional contexts, it is possible that activation patterns
      within the MPFC may represent both of these types of cognitive processes when
      presented simultaneously. The current study tested this possibility by employing 
      a large-scale automated meta-analysis tool, together with multivoxel pattern
      analysis to investigate the representational similarity of social and valence
      information in the MPFC during fMRI. Using a representational similarity
      analysis, we found a high degree of representational similarity both within
      social dimensions and within valence dimensions, but not across them (e.g.,
      positive social information was highly dissimilar to negative nonsocial
      information), in a ventral portion of the MPFC. These results were significantly 
      correlated with a behaviorally measured similarity structure of the same stimuli,
      suggesting that a psychologically meaningful representation of social and valence
      information is reflected by multivoxel activation patterns in the ventral MPFC.

      separated from their mothers and were mechanically immobilized and had rectal
      sensitization with mustard essential oil for 1 week. The control group had no
      treatment. After 2 weeks, balloon catheters were inflated with 5 or 10 mL of air 
      in the rectums of both groups. BOLD-fMRI was performed and the data analyzed by
      imaging software. In the IBS model group, rectal stimulation with 5 mL air
      distension activated the anterior cingulate cortex, insula cortex (IC),
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), and thalamus, while 10 mL air significantly activated
      the ACC, IC, PFC, and thalamus in the model, but not controls. IBS model group
      was hypersensitive to visceral stimulation by rectal balloon inflation. The major
      brain areas participating in visceral sensation included the IC, PFC, and
      thalamus.

TI  - Relationship of monoamine oxidase-A distribution volume to postpartum depression 
      and postpartum crying.
PG  - 429-35
LID - 10.1038/npp.2014.190 [doi]
AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD) has a prevalence rate of 13% and a similarly high
      proportion of women report a subclinical state of one or more major depressive
      episode symptoms. The aim was to investigate whether monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) 
      VT, an index of MAO-A density, is increased in the prefrontal and anterior
      cingulate cortex (PFC and ACC), during PPD or when a PPD spectrum symptom,
      greater predisposition to crying, is present. MAO-A is an enzyme that increases
      in density after estrogen decline, and has several functions including creating
      oxidative stress, influencing apoptosis and monoamine metabolism. Fifty-seven
      women were recruited including 15 first-onset, antidepressant naive, PPD
      subjects, 12 postpartum healthy who cry due to sad mood, 15 asymptomatic
      postpartum healthy women, and 15 healthy women not recently pregnant. Each
      underwent [(11)C]-harmine positron emission tomography scanning to measure MAO-A 
      VT. Both PPD and greater predisposition to crying were associated with greater
      MAO-A VT in the PFC and ACC (multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), group
      effect, F21,135=1.856; p=0.019; mean combined region elevation 21% and 14% in PPD
      and crying groups, respectively, relative to postpartum asymptomatic). Greater
      MAO-A VT in the PFC and ACC represents a new biomarker in PPD, and the PPD
      symptom of predisposition to crying. Novel strategies for preventing PPD (and
      some PPD symptoms) may be possible by avoiding environmental conditions that
      elevate MAO-A level and enhancing conditions that normalize MAO-A level. These
      findings also argue for clinical trials in PPD with the newer, well-tolerated
      MAO-A inhibitor antidepressants.

TI  - Developmental changes in effective connectivity associated with relational
      reasoning.
PG  - 3262-76
AB  - Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) is part of a frontoparietal network of
      regions involved in relational reasoning, the mental process of working with
      relationships between multiple mental representations. RLPFC has shown functional
      and structural changes with age, with increasing specificity of left RLPFC
      activation for relational integration during development. Here, we used dynamic
      causal modeling (DCM) to investigate changes in effective connectivity during a
      relational reasoning task through the transition from adolescence into adulthood.
      We examined fMRI data of 37 healthy female participants (11-30 years old)
      performing a relational reasoning paradigm. Comparing relational integration to
      the manipulation of single relations revealed activation in five regions: the
      RLPFC, anterior insula, dorsolateral PFC, inferior parietal lobe, and medial
      superior frontal gyrus. We used a new exhaustive search approach and identified a
      full DCM model, which included all reciprocal connections between the five
      clusters in the left hemisphere, as the optimal model. In line with previous
      resting state fMRI results, we showed distinct developmental effects on the
      strength of long-range frontoparietal versus frontoinsular short-range fixed
      connections. The modulatory connections associated with relational integration
      increased with age. Gray matter volume in left RLPFC, which decreased with age,
      partly accounted for changes in fixed PFC connectivity. Finally, improvements in 
      relational integration performance were associated with greater modulatory and
      weaker fixed PFC connectivity. This pattern provides further evidence of
      increasing specificity of left PFC function for relational integration compared
      to the manipulation of single relations, and demonstrates an association between 
      effective connectivity and performance during development.

      women with bipolar disorder.
PG  - 374-87
LID - 10.1111/acps.12314 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Explore interrelationships between suicide attempt history (Objective 
      1) or suicide attempt severity (Objective 2) with prefrontal cortex gray matter
      (PFCGM ) volume and illness-course in patients with bipolar disorder (BD).
      METHOD: Ninety-three women with BD-I or -II diagnosis (51 with and 42 without
      suicide attempt history) underwent structural MRI and filled out questionnaires. 
      Measured were GM volumes of 11 PFC regions, BD illness-course, and attempt
      history and severity. Effects were examined with repeated measures GLM or logit
      analyses. RESULTS: Objective 1: Attempt history was associated with increased
      trait impulsivity and aggression, and higher prevalence of BD-I, past drug use
      disorder, and past psychiatric hospitalization. PFCGM volume was lower in
      patients with than without attempt history in those with past psychiatric
      hospitalization. PFCGM volume was higher in patients with than without attempt
      history in those without hospitalization. Higher trait aggression predicted
      attempt history. Objective 2: Increased frontal pole volume and younger age at
      first hospitalization predicted many suicide attempts. CONCLUSION: Attempt
      history in patients with BD related to PFCGM volume reduction or increase. Volume
      modulation by psychiatric hospitalization could reflect effects of illness-course
      or care. Attempt severity was not related to volume reduction. Research on
      suicidality-brain relationships should include illness-course and attempt
      severity measures.

LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4889-13.2014 [doi]
AB  - The ability to inhibit prepotent responses is critical for successful
      goal-directed behaviors. To investigate the neural basis of inhibitory control,
      we conducted a magnetoencephalography study where human participants performed
      the antisaccade task. Results indicated that neural oscillations in the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) showed significant task modulations in preparation to
      suppress saccades. Before successfully inhibiting a saccade, beta-band power
      (18-38 Hz) in the lateral PFC and alpha-band power (10-18 Hz) in the frontal eye 
      field (FEF) increased. Trial-by-trial prestimulus FEF alpha-band power predicted 
      successful saccadic inhibition. Further, inhibitory control enhanced
      cross-frequency amplitude coupling between PFC beta-band (18-38 Hz) activity and 
      FEF alpha-band activity, and the coupling appeared to be initiated by the PFC.
      Our results suggest a generalized mechanism for top-down inhibitory control:
      prefrontal beta-band activity initiates alpha-band activity for functional
      inhibition of the effector and/or sensory system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a prevalent anxiety disorder,
      but its neurobiological basis has been poorly studied. A few cognitive models
      have been proposed for understanding GAD development and maintenance. The aim of 
      this study is to review functional Magnetic Resonance Image (fMRI) studies
      conducted with GAD patients and evaluate if they support and underpin the
      theoretical cognitive models proposed for this anxiety disorder. METHODS: A
      literature systematic review was undertaken in PubMed and ISI databases with no
      time limits. RESULTS: From the studies included in this review, 10 explored the
      "emotional dysregulation model", showing, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC) hypofunction and deficient top-down control system during 
      emotion regulation tasks, despite conflicting techniques and results. Only one
      study explored the "conditioned fear overgeneralization theory", other the
      "intolerance of uncertainty model" and two studies were unspecific (worry
      induction tasks). Between those, there were 4 studies evaluating pre- and
      post-treatment with antidepressants or "mindfulness". LIMITATIONS: The studies
      methodologies differ between one another making it difficult to identify a common
      finding. CONCLUSION: Emotion dysregulation seems to be an important cognitive
      dysfunction in GAD patients and fMRI studies suggest that it is related to PFC
      and ACC hypofunction as well as a deficient cortex-amygdala functional
      connectivity.

      effect.

AB  - Evidence from neuropsychology and neuroimaging indicate that the pre-frontal
      cortex (PFC) plays an important role in human memory. Although frontal patients
      are able to form new memories, these memories appear qualitatively different from
      those of controls by lacking distinctiveness. Neuroimaging studies of memory
      indicate activation in the PFC under deep encoding conditions, and under
      conditions of semantic elaboration. Based on these results, we hypothesize that
      the PFC enhances memory by extracting differences and commonalities in the
      studied material. To test this hypothesis, we carried out an experimental
      investigation to test the relationship between the PFC-dependent factors and
      semantic factors associated with common and specific features of words. These
      experiments were performed using Free-Recall of word lists with healthy adults,
      exploiting the correlation between PFC function and fluid intelligence. As
      predicted, a correlation was found between fluid intelligence and the
      Von-Restorff effect (better memory for semantic isolates, e.g., isolate "cat"
      within category members of "fruit"). Moreover, memory for the semantic isolate
      was found to depend on the isolate's serial position. The isolate item tends to
      be recalled first, in comparison to non-isolates, suggesting that the process
      interacts with short term memory. These results are captured within a
      computational model of free recall, which includes a PFC mechanism that is
      sensitive to both commonality and distinctiveness, sustaining a trade-off between
      the two.

AB  - Despite myriads of studies on a parallel organization of
      cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical loops, direct evidence of this has been lacking
      for the healthy human brain. Here, we scrutinize the functional specificity of
      the cortico-subcortical loops depending on varying levels of cognitive hierarchy 
      as well as their structural connectivity with high-resolution fMRI and
      diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) at 7 tesla. Three levels of cognitive hierarchy
      were implemented in two domains: second language and nonlanguage. In fMRI, for
      the higher level, activations were found in the ventroanterior portion of the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), the head of the caudate nucleus (CN), and the ventral
      anterior nucleus (VA) in the thalamus. Conversely, for the lower level,
      activations were located in the posterior region of the PFC, the body of the CN, 
      and the medial dorsal nucleus (MD) in the thalamus. This gradient pattern of
      activations was furthermore shown to be tenable by the parallel connectivity in
      dMRI tractography connecting the anterior regions of the PFC with the head of the
      CN and the VA in the thalamus, whereas the posterior activations of the PFC were 
      linked to the body of the CN and the MD in the thalamus. This is the first human 
      in vivo study combining fMRI and dMRI showing that the functional specificity is 
      mirrored within the cortico-subcortical loop substantiated by parallel networks.

TI  - Abstinence from cocaine and sucrose self-administration reveals altered
      mesocorticolimbic circuit connectivity by resting state MRI.
PG  - 499-510
LID - 10.1089/brain.2014.0264 [doi]
AB  - Previous preclinical studies have emphasized that drugs of abuse, through actions
      within and between mesocorticolimbic (MCL) regions, usurp learning and memory
      processes normally involved in the pursuit of natural rewards. To distinguish MCL
      circuit pathobiological neuroadaptations that accompany addiction from general
      learning processes associated with natural reward, we trained two groups of rats 
      to self-administer either cocaine (IV) or sucrose (orally) followed by an
      identically enforced 30 day abstinence period. These procedures are known to
      induce behavioral changes and neuroadaptations. A third group of sedentary
      animals served as a negative control group for general handling effects. We
      examined low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations in the functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) signal, known as resting-state functional connectivity
      (rsFC), as a measure of intrinsic neurobiological interactions between brain
      regions. Decreased rsFC was seen in the cocaine-SA compared with both sucrose-SA 
      and housing control groups between prelimbic (PrL) cortex and entopeduncular
      nucleus and between nucleus accumbens core (AcbC) and dorsomedial prefrontal
      cortex (dmPFC). Moreover, individual differences in cocaine SA escalation
      predicted connectivity strength only in the Acb-dmPFC circuit. These data provide
      evidence of fronto-striatal plasticity across the addiction trajectory, which are
      consistent with Acb-PFC hypoactivity seen in abstinent human drug addicts,
      indicating potential circuit level biomarkers that may inform therapeutic
      interventions. They further suggest that available data from cross-sectional
      human studies may reflect the consequence of rather a predispositional
      predecessor to their dependence.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most prevalent
      mental disorders in the elderly, but its functional neuroanatomy is not well
      understood. Given the role of emotion dysregulation in GAD, we sought to describe
      the neural bases of emotion regulation in late-life GAD by analyzing the
      functional connectivity (FC) in the Salience Network and the Executive Control
      Network during worry induction and worry reappraisal. METHODS: The study included
      28 elderly GAD and 31 non-anxious comparison participants. Twelve elderly GAD
      completed a 12-week pharmacotherapy trial. We used an in-scanner worry script
      that alternates blocks of worry induction and reappraisal. We assessed network
      FC, using the following seeds: anterior insula (AI), dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (dlPFC), the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), and the
      paraventricular nucleus (PVN). RESULTS: GAD participants exhibited greater FC
      during worry induction between the left AI and the right orbitofrontal cortex,
      and between the BNST and the subgenual cingulate. During worry reappraisal, the
      non-anxious participants had greater FC between the left dlPFC and the medial
      PFC, as well as between the left AI and the medial PFC, and elderly GAD patients 
      had greater FC between the PVN and the amygdala. Following 12 weeks of
      pharmacotherapy, GAD participants had greater connectivity between the dlPFC and 
      several prefrontal regions during worry reappraisal. CONCLUSION: FC during worry 
      induction and reappraisal points toward abnormalities in both worry generation
      and worry reappraisal. Following successful pharmacologic treatment, we observed 
      greater connectivity in the prefrontal nodes of the Executive Control Network
      during reappraisal of worry.

TI  - The developmental mismatch in structural brain maturation during adolescence.
PG  - 147-60
LID - 10.1159/000362328 [doi]
AB  - Regions of the human brain develop at different rates across the first two
      decades of life, with some maturing before others. It has been hypothesized that 
      a mismatch in the timing of maturation between subcortical regions (involved in
      affect and reward processing) and prefrontal regions (involved in cognitive
      control) underlies the increase in risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors
      observed during adolescence. Most support for this 'dual systems' hypothesis
      relies on cross-sectional data, and it is not known whether this pattern is
      present at an individual level. The current study utilizes longitudinal
      structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to describe the developmental
      trajectories of regions associated with risk-taking and sensation-seeking
      behaviors, namely, the amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and prefrontal cortex
      (PFC). Structural trajectories of gray matter volumes were analyzed using
      FreeSurfer in 33 participants aged 7-30 years, each of whom had at least three
      high-quality MRI scans spanning three developmental periods: late childhood,
      adolescence and early adulthood (total 152 scans). The majority of individuals in
      our sample showed relatively earlier maturation in the amygdala and/or NAcc
      compared to the PFC, providing evidence for a mismatch in the timing of
      structural maturation between these structures. We then related individual
      developmental trajectories to retrospectively assessed self-reported risk-taking 
      and sensation-seeking behaviors during adolescence in a subsample of 24
      participants. Analysis of this smaller sample failed to find a relationship
      between the presence of a mismatch in brain maturation and risk-taking and
      sensation-seeking behaviors during adolescence. Taken together, it appears that
      the developmental mismatch in structural brain maturation is present in
      neurotypically developing individuals. This pattern of development did not
      directly relate to self-reported behaviors at an individual level in our sample, 
      highlighting the need for prospective studies combining anatomical and behavioral
      measures.

AB  - Social functioning has received widespread attention as one of the most important
      outcomes in psychiatric disorders and has been related to cognitive functioning
      and the underlying brain activity. Cognitive decline, however, appears not only
      in the psychiatric population but also in aged individuals. In our previous
      study, we demonstrated a significant relationship between social functioning and 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity in patients with depression. However, it has not
      been shown whether the above relationship could be extended to healthy
      populations. The purpose of the present study was to investigate a possible
      association between social functioning and prefrontal hemodynamic responses in
      healthy elderly adults by using a non-invasive and low-constraint functional
      neuroimaging technique, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Study subjects
      included 55 healthy, elderly volunteers. We measured hemodynamic responses over
      prefrontal cortical (PFC) areas during the verbal fluency task by using
      multi-channel NIRS and analyzed the relationship between task-associated
      hemodynamic responses and social functioning as measured by the social adaptation
      self-evaluation scale (SASS). A significant positive relationship was observed
      between the SASS total score and PFC activation. Our findings suggest that PFC
      activation is associated with social functioning in healthy elderly adults.
      Furthermore, hemodynamic responses assessed using non-invasive NIRS could be a
      useful biological marker of these characteristics.

AB  - The mesocortical dopaminergic pathway projecting from the ventral tegmental area 
      (VTA) to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) contributes to the processing of reward
      signals. This pathway is regulated by gonadal steroids including estradiol. To
      address the putative role of estradiol and isotype-selective estrogen receptor
      (ER) agonists in the regulation of the rodent mesocortical system, we combined
      fMRI, HPLC-MS and qRT-PCR techniques. In fMRI experiments adult, chronically
      ovariectomized rats, treated with either vehicle, estradiol, ERalpha agonist
      16alpha-lactone-estradiol (LE2) or ERbeta agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN),
      received a single dose of d-amphetamine-sulphate (10mg/kg, i.p.) and BOLD
      responses were monitored in the VTA and the PFC. Ovariectomized rats showed no
      significant response to amphetamine. In contrast, the VTA of ER
      agonist-substituted ovariectomized rats showed robust amphetamine-evoked BOLD
      increases. The PFC of estradiol-replaced animals was also responsive to
      amphetamine. Mass spectroscopic analysis of dopamine and its metabolites revealed
      a two-fold increase in both dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid content
      of the PFC in estradiol-replaced animals compared to ovariectomized controls.
      qRT-PCR studies revealed upregulation of dopamine transporter and dopamine
      receptor in the VTA and PFC, respectively, of ER agonist-treated ovariectomized
      animals. Collectively, the results indicate that E2 and isotype-selective ER
      agonists can powerfully modulate the responsiveness of the mesocortical
      dopaminergic system, increase the expression of key genes related to dopaminergic
      neurotransmission and augment the dopamine content of the PFC. In a broader
      sense, the findings support the concept that the manifestation of reward signals 
      in the PFC is dependent on the actual estrogen milieu of the brain.

TI  - Developmental topographical disorientation and decreased hippocampal functional
      connectivity.
PG  - 1364-74
LID - 10.1002/hipo.22317 [doi]
AB  - Developmental topographical disorientation (DTD) is a newly discovered cognitive 
      disorder in which individuals experience a lifelong history of getting lost in
      both novel and familiar surroundings. Recent studies have shown that such a
      selective orientation defect relies primarily on the inability of the individuals
      to form cognitive maps, i.e., mental representations of the surrounding that
      allow individuals to get anywhere from any location in the environment, although 
      other orientation skills are additionally affected. To date, the neural
      correlates of this developmental condition are unknown. Here, we tested the
      hypothesis that DTD may be related to ineffective functional connectivity between
      the hippocampus (HC; known to be critical for cognitive maps) and other brain
      regions critical for spatial orientation. A group of individuals with DTD and a
      group of control subjects underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (rsfMRI) scan. In addition, we performed voxel-based morphometry to
      investigate potential structural differences between individuals with DTD and
      controls. The results of the rsfMRI study revealed a decreased functional
      connectivity between the right HC and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in individuals 
      with DTD. No structural differences were detected between groups. These findings 
      provide evidence that ineffective functional connectivity between HC and PFC may 
      affect the monitoring and processing of spatial information while moving within
      an environment, resulting in the lifelong selective inability of individuals with
      DTD to form cognitive maps that are critical for orienting in both familiar and
      unfamiliar surroundings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Suicide is highly-prevalent and the most serious outcome in
      schizophrenia, yet the disturbances in neural system functions that confer
      suicide risk remain obscure. Circuits operated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are
      altered in psychotic disorders, and various PFC changes are observed in
      post-mortem studies of completed suicide. We tested whether PFC activity during
      goal-representation (an important component of cognitive control) relates to
      long-term suicide risk in recent-onset schizophrenia. METHOD: 35 patients with
      recent-onset of DSM-IV-TR-defined schizophrenia (SZ) were evaluated for long-term
      suicide risk (using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale) and functional
      MRI during cognitive control task performance. Group-level regression models
      associating control-related brain activation with suicide risk controlled for
      depression, psychosis and impulsivity. RESULTS: Within this group, past suicidal 
      ideation was associated with lower activation with goal-representation demands in
      multiple PFC sectors. Among those with past suicidal ideation (n=18), reported
      suicidal behavior was associated with lower control-related activation in
      premotor cortex ipsilateral to the active primary motor cortex. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study provides unique evidence that suicide risk directly relates to PFC-based
      circuit dysfunction during goal-representation, in a major mental illness with
      significant suicide rates. Among those with suicidal ideation, the overt
      expression in suicidal behavior may stem from impairments in premotor cortex
      support of action-planning as an expression of control. Further work should
      address how PFC-based control function changes with risk over time, whether this 
      brain-behavior relationship is specific to schizophrenia, and address its
      potential utility as a biomarker for interventions to mitigate suicide risk.

TI  - The neural basis of temporal order processing in past and future thought.
PG  - 185-97
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00680 [doi]
AB  - Although growing evidence has shown that remembering the past and imagining the
      future recruit a common core network of frontal-parietal-temporal regions, the
      extent to which these regions contribute to the temporal dimension of
      autobiographical thought remains unclear. In this fMRI study, we focused on the
      event-sequencing aspect of time and examined whether ordering past and future
      events involve common neural substrates. Participants had to determine which of
      two past (or future) events occurred (or would occur) before the other, and these
      order judgments were compared with a task requiring to think about the content of
      the same past or future events. For both past and future events, we found that
      the left posterior hippocampus was more activated when establishing the order of 
      events, whereas the anterior hippocampus was more activated when representing
      their content. Aside from the hippocampus, most of the brain regions that were
      activated when thinking about temporal order (notably the intraparietal sulcus,
      dorsolateral pFC, dorsal anterior cingulate, and visual cortex) lied outside the 
      core network and may reflect the involvement of controlled processes and
      visuospatial imagery to locate events in time. Collectively, these findings
      suggest (a) that the same processing operations are engaged for ordering past
      events and planned future events in time, (b) that anterior and posterior
      portions of the hippocampus are involved in processing different aspects of
      autobiographical thought, and (c) that temporal order is not necessarily an
      intrinsic property of memory or future thought but instead requires additional,
      controlled processes.

      Hz, 130 Hz or sham) in rats (n = 9) was followed by 2-deoxy-2-[(18) F]
      fluoro-D-glucose ([(18) F]FDG) muPET. RESULTS: Sixty Hz DBS elicited significant 
      hypermetabolism in the ipsilateral PL ([(18) F]FDG uptake +5.2 +/- 2.3 %, p <
      0.05). At 130 Hz, hypometabolism was induced in the ipsilateral PL (-2.5 +/- 2.6 
      %, non-significant). Statistical parametric mapping revealed hypo and
      hypermetabolism clusters for both 60 and 130 Hz versus sham and show a certain
      state of alertness (increased activity in sensory and motor-related regions)
      mainly for 60 Hz. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the potential of 60 Hz PL mPFC
      DBS for the treatment of disorders associated with prefrontal hypofunction.

AB  - Externally directed cognition (EDC) involves attending to stimuli in the external
      environment, whereas internally directed cognition (IDC) involves attending
      internally to thoughts, memories and mental imagery. To date, most studies have
      focused on the competition or trade-offs between these modes of cognition.
      However, both EDC and IDC include a variety of cognitive states that differ along
      multiple dimensions. These dimensions may influence the way in which EDC and IDC 
      relate to each other. In this review, we present a novel framework that considers
      whether cognitive resources are oriented externally or internally, and also
      whether a given cognitive state involves intentional (i.e., voluntary) or
      spontaneous (i.e., involuntary) processing. Within this framework, we examine the
      conditions under which EDC and IDC are expected to either compete, or co-occur
      without interference. We argue that EDC and IDC are not inherently antagonistic, 
      but when both involve higher levels of intentionality they are increasingly
      likely to compete, due to the capacity limitations of intentional processing. In 
      contrast, if one or both involve spontaneous processing, EDC and IDC can co-occur
      with minimal interference given that involuntary processes are not subject to the
      same capacity constraints. A review of the brain regions implicated in EDC and
      IDC suggests that their neural substrates are partially segregated and partially 
      convergent. Both EDC and IDC recruit the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) during
      intentional processing, and may therefore compete over the processes and
      representational space it supports. However, at lower levels of intentionality,
      EDC and IDC rely on largely distinct neural structures, which may enable their
      co-occurrence without interference. The proposal that EDC and IDC can in some
      cases co-occur, provides a framework for understanding the complex mental states 
      that underlie theory of mind, creativity, the influence of self-evaluative
      processing on cognitive control, and memory-guided attention.

TI  - Prenatal cocaine exposure and adolescent neural responses to appetitive and
      stressful stimuli.
PG  - 2824-34
LID - 10.1038/npp.2014.133 [doi]
AB  - Preclinical research has demonstrated the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure
      (PCE) on brain regions involved in emotional regulation, motivational control,
      and addiction vulnerability-eg, the ventral striatum (VS), anterior cingulate
      (ACC), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, little is known about the function
      of these regions in human adolescents with PCE. Twenty-two adolescents with PCE
      and 22 age-, gender-, and IQ-matched non-cocaine exposed (NCE) adolescents
      underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during exposure to
      individually personalized neutral/relaxing, stressful, and favorite-food cues.
      fMRI data were compared using group-level two-tailed t-tests in the BioImage
      Suite. In comparison with NCE adolescents, PCE adolescents had reduced activity
      within cortical and subcortical brain regions, including the VS, ACC, and medial 
      and dorslolateral PFC during exposure to favorite-food cues but did not differ in
      neural responses to stress cues. Subjective food craving was inversely related to
      dorsolateral PFC activation among PCE adolescents. Among PCE adolescents,
      subjective anxiety ratings correlated inversely with activations in the
      orbitofrontal cortex and brainstem during the stress condition and with ACC,
      dorsolateral PFC, and hippocampus activity during the neutral-relaxing condition.
      Thus adolescents with PCE display hypoactivation of brain regions involved in
      appetitive processing, with subjective intensities of craving and anxiety
      correlating inversely with extent of activation. These findings suggest possible 
      mechanisms by which PCE might predispose to the development of addictions and
      related disorders, eg, substance-use disorders and binge-eating.

TI  - Pre-task prefrontal activation during cognitive processes in aging: a
      near-infrared spectroscopy study.
PG  - e98779
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0098779 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cognitive processing generally deteriorates as people age. Recent
      neuroimaging studies have shown that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in
      human-specific behavior, such as preparing for future actions and prospective
      memory; hence, the PFC may be voluntarily activated even during the "resting"
      condition that precedes task execution. The purpose of the present study was to
      investigate changes in voluntary pre-task activation as a result of aging using a
      paradigm that includes a longer intertrial interval (e.g., 30 sec) than has been 
      used in previous studies. METHODS: A total of 120 cognitively normal adults
      (young: 60, old: 60) participated in this near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
      study. All subjects performed 6 repetitions of the working memory task, which
      included a 30 sec resting period and a 28.8 sec task period. The resting period
      was divided into baseline and pre-task (preT) periods, and the task period was
      divided into early easy task (eT) and late difficult task (dT) periods. We then
      normalized the data, analyzed the magnitude of task-related NIRS responses in
      each period and compared the results between groups using an analysis of variance
      test. RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed a significant interaction between
      group x optode location x period, in which hemodynamic responses in the PFC
      during the preT period were smaller in the elderly in than young adults. By
      contrast, during the task period, the hemodynamic responses were higher in the
      lateral PFC in the elderly than in young adults. Spearman's rank correlation
      analysis showed a positive correlation between hemodynamic changes during the
      preT period in the PFC and correct answer ratios in both groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      These findings suggest that more pre-task activation in the anterior PFC is
      related to better cognitive performance in humans. Thus, a reduction in this
      activation might partly explain cognitive decline in the elderly.

TI  - Psychosocial functioning is correlated with activation in the anterior cingulate 
      cortex and left lateral prefrontal cortex during a verbal fluency task in
      euthymic bipolar disorder: a preliminary fMRI study.
PG  - 188-96
AB  - AIM: Cognitive impairment may account for functional and occupational disability 
      in patients with bipolar disorder even during periods of euthymia. While imaging 
      suggests structural, neurochemical, and functional abnormalities in bipolar
      disorder patients, the pathophysiology of these deficits has not been elucidated.
      It was hypothesized that euthymic bipolar patients would have different cortical 
      activation during a verbal fluency task compared to healthy controls, and that
      psychosocial functioning would be associated with prefrontal cortical activation 
      during the task in the bipolar group. METHODS: Ten euthymic bipolar patients and 
      10 healthy control participants (matched for age, gender, and years of education)
      underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a verbal fluency
      task, tapping task and visual task. Correlational analysis between the fMRI brain
      activation and clinical variables of the participants, including Global
      Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score, was performed. RESULTS: Compared to the
      controls, euthymic bipolar patients had significantly greater activation in the
      bilateral precuneus with similar behavioral performance during the verbal fluency
      task. There were no significant differences between the groups for the visual
      task or the simple motor task. Activation in both the left anterior cingulate
      cortex (ACC) and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) were significantly
      positively correlated with GAF score in the euthymic bipolar patients.
      CONCLUSION: Both the ACC and lateral PFC regions are components of a neural
      network that plays a critical role in psychosocial functioning, and are often
      found to be affected in bipolar patients.

TI  - Manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging reveals increased DOI-induced brain
      activity in a mouse model of schizophrenia.
PG  - E2492-500
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1323287111 [doi]
AB  - Maternal infection during pregnancy increases the risk for schizophrenia in
      offspring. In rodent models, maternal immune activation (MIA) yields offspring
      with schizophrenia-like behaviors. None of these behaviors are, however, specific
      to schizophrenia. The presence of hallucinations is a key diagnostic symptom of
      schizophrenia. In mice, this symptom can be defined as brain activation in the
      absence of external stimuli, which can be mimicked by administration of
      hallucinogens. We find that, compared with controls, adult MIA offspring display 
      an increased stereotypical behavioral response to the hallucinogen
      2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), an agonist for serotonin receptor 2A
      (5-HT2AR). This may be explained by increased levels of 5-HT2AR and downstream
      signaling molecules in unstimulated MIA prefrontal cortex (PFC). Using
      manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to identify neuronal activation
      elicited by DOI administration, we find that, compared with controls, MIA
      offspring exhibit a greater manganese (Mn(2+)) accumulation in several brain
      areas, including the PFC, thalamus, and striatum. The parafascicular thalamic
      nucleus, which plays the role in the pathogenesis of hallucinations, is activated
      by DOI in MIA offspring only. Additionally, compared with controls, MIA offspring
      demonstrate higher DOI-induced expression of early growth response protein 1,
      cyclooxygenase-2, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the PFC. Chronic
      treatment with the 5-HT2AR antagonist ketanserin reduces DOI-induced head
      twitching in MIA offspring. Thus, the MIA mouse model can be successfully used to
      investigate activity induced by DOI in awake, behaving mice. Moreover,
      manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is a useful, noninvasive method for
      accurately measuring this type of activity.

TI  - Sustained anxiety increases amygdala-dorsomedial prefrontal coupling: a mechanism
      for maintaining an anxious state in healthy adults.
PG  - 321-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging research has traditionally explored fear and anxiety in 
      response to discrete threat cues (e.g., during fear conditioning). However,
      anxiety is a sustained aversive state that can persist in the absence of discrete
      threats. Little is known about mechanisms that maintain anxiety states over a
      prolonged period. Here, we used a robust translational paradigm (threat of shock)
      to induce sustained anxiety. Recent translational work has implicated an
      amygdala-prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuit in the maintenance of anxiety in
      rodents. To explore the functional homologues of this circuitry in humans, we
      used a novel paradigm to examine the impact of sustained anticipatory anxiety on 
      amygdala-PFC intrinsic connectivity. METHODS: Task-independent fMRI data were
      collected in healthy participants during long-duration periods of shock
      anticipation and safety. We examined intrinsic functional connectivity. RESULTS: 
      Our study involved 20 healthy participants. During sustained anxiety, amygdala
      activity was positively coupled with dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) activity. High trait
      anxiety was associated with increased amygdala-DMPFC coupling. In addition,
      induced anxiety was associated with positive coupling between regions involved in
      defensive responding, and decreased coupling between regions involved in
      emotional control and the default mode network. LIMITATIONS: Inferences regarding
      anxious pathology should be made with caution because this study was conducted in
      healthy participants. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that anticipatory anxiety
      increases intrinsic amygdala-DMPFC coupling and that the DMPFC may serve as a
      functional homologue for the rodent prefrontal regions by sustaining anxiety.
      Future research may use this defensive neural context to identify biomarkers of
      risk for anxious pathology and target these circuits for therapeutic
      intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety produced by environmental threats can impair goal-directed
      processing and is associated with a range of psychiatric disorders, particularly 
      when aversive events occur unpredictably. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought 
      to implement controls that minimize performance disruptions from threat-induced
      anxiety and goal distraction by modulating activity in regions involved in threat
      detection, such as the amygdala. The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), orbitofrontal 
      cortex (OFC), and ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) have been linked to the regulation of 
      anxiety during threat exposure. We developed a paradigm to determine if
      threat-induced anxiety would enhance functional connectivity between the amygdala
      and IFG, OFC, and vmPFC. METHODS: Healthy adults performed a computer-gaming
      style task involving capturing prey and evading predators to optimize monetary
      rewards while exposed to the threat of unpredictable shock. Psychophysiological
      recording (n = 26) and functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning (n = 17)
      were collected during the task in separate cohorts. Task-specific changes in
      functional connectivity with the amygdala were examined using psychophysiological
      interaction analysis. RESULTS: Threat exposure resulted in greater arousal
      measured by increased skin conductance but did not influence performance (i.e.,
      monetary losses or rewards). Greater functional connectivity between the right
      amygdala and bilateral IFG, OFC, vmPFC, anterior cingulate cortex, and
      frontopolar cortex was associated with threat exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to 
      unpredictable threat modulates amygdala-PFC functional connectivity that may help
      maintain performance when experiencing anxiety induced by threat. Our paradigm is
      well-suited to explore the neural underpinnings of the anxiety response to
      unpredictable threat in patients with various anxiety disorders.

AB  - Novelty seeking (NS) and harm avoidance (HA) are two major dimensions of
      temperament in Cloningers neurobiological model of personality. Previous
      neurofunctional and biological studies on temperament dimensions of HA and NS
      suggested that the temperamental traits have significant correlations with
      cortical and subcortical brain regions. However, no study to date has
      investigated the functional network modular organization as a function of the
      temperament dimension. The temperament dimensions were originally proposed to be 
      independent of one another. However, a meta-analysis based on 16 published
      articles found a significant negative correlation between HA and NS (Miettunen et
      al., 2008). Based on this negative correlation, the current study revealed the
      whole-brain connectivity modular architecture for two contrasting temperament
      groups. The k-means clustering algorithm, with the temperamental traits of HA and
      NS as an input, was applied to divide the 40 subjects into two temperament
      groups: 'high HA and low NS' versus 'low HA and high NS'. Using the graph
      theoretical framework, we found a functional segregation of whole brain network
      architectures derived from resting-state functional MRI. In the 'high HA and low 
      NS' group, the regulatory brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), are
      clustered together with the limbic system. In the 'low HA and high NS' group,
      however, brain regions lying on the dopaminergic pathways, such as the PFC and
      basal ganglia, are partitioned together. These findings suggest that the neural
      basis of inhibited, passive, and inactive behaviors in the 'high HA and low NS'
      group was derived from the increased network associations between the PFC and
      limbic clusters. In addition, supporting evidence of topological differences
      between the two temperament groups was found by analyzing the functional
      connectivity density and gray matter volume, and by computing the relationships
      between the morphometry and function of the brain.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves reasoning in the service of adaptive
      behavior. Little is known, however, about the architecture of reasoning processes
      in the PFC. Using computational modeling and neuroimaging, we show here that the 
      human PFC has two concurrent inferential tracks: (i) one from ventromedial to
      dorsomedial PFC regions that makes probabilistic inferences about the reliability
      of the ongoing behavioral strategy and arbitrates between adjusting this strategy
      versus exploring new ones from long-term memory, and (ii) another from polar to
      lateral PFC regions that makes probabilistic inferences about the reliability of 
      two or three alternative strategies and arbitrates between exploring new
      strategies versus exploiting these alternative ones. The two tracks interact and,
      along with the striatum, realize hypothesis testing for accepting versus
      rejecting newly created strategies.

AB  - ABSTRACT. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a developing and promising
      functional brain imaging technology. Developing data analysis methods to
      effectively extract meaningful information from collected data is the major
      bottleneck in popularizing this technology. In this study, we measured
      hemodynamic activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during a color-word matching 
      Stroop task using NIRS. Hemispheric lateralization was examined by employing
      traditional activation and novel NIRS-based connectivity analyses simultaneously.
      Wavelet transform coherence was used to assess intrahemispheric functional
      connectivity. Spearman correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship 
      between behavioral performance and activation/functional connectivity,
      respectively. In agreement with activation analysis, functional connectivity
      analysis revealed leftward lateralization for the Stroop effect and correlation
      with behavioral performance. However, functional connectivity was more sensitive 
      than activation for identifying hemispheric lateralization. Granger causality was
      used to evaluate the effective connectivity between hemispheres. The results
      showed increased information flow from the left to the right hemispheres for the 
      incongruent versus the neutral task, indicating a leading role of the left PFC.
      This study demonstrates that the NIRS-based connectivity can reveal the
      functional architecture of the brain more comprehensively than traditional
      activation, helping to better utilize the advantages of NIRS.

TI  - Less Effort, Better Results: How Does Music Act on Prefrontal Cortex in Older
      Adults during Verbal Encoding? An fNIRS Study.
PG  - 301
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00301 [doi]
AB  - Several neuroimaging studies of cognitive aging revealed deficits in episodic
      memory abilities as a result of prefrontal cortex (PFC) limitations. Improving
      episodic memory performance despite PFC deficits is thus a critical issue in
      aging research. Listening to music stimulates cognitive performance in several
      non-purely musical activities (e.g., language and memory). Thus, music could
      represent a rich and helpful source during verbal encoding and therefore help
      subsequent retrieval. Furthermore, such benefit could be reflected in less demand
      of PFC, which is known to be crucial for encoding processes. This study aimed to 
      investigate whether music may improve episodic memory in older adults while
      decreasing the PFC activity. Sixteen healthy older adults (mu = 64.5 years)
      encoded lists of words presented with or without a musical background while their
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity was monitored using a
      eight-channel continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system (Oxymon Mk
      III, Artinis, The Netherlands). Behavioral results indicated a better
      source-memory performance for words encoded with music compared to words encoded 
      with silence (p < 0.05). Functional NIRS data revealed bilateral decrease of
      oxyhemoglobin values in the music encoding condition compared to the silence
      condition (p < 0.05), suggesting that music modulates the activity of the DLPFC
      during encoding in a less-demanding direction. Taken together, our results
      indicate that music can help older adults in memory performances by decreasing
      their PFC activity. These findings open new perspectives about music as tool for 
      episodic memory rehabilitation on special populations with memory deficits due to
      frontal lobe damage such as Alzheimer's patients.

AB  - Despite the fact that associative memory studies produce a large number of false 
      memories, neuroimaging analyses utilizing this paradigm typically focus only on
      neural activity mediating successful retrieval. The current study sought to
      expand on this prior research by examining the neural basis of both true and
      false associative memories. Though associative false memories are substantially
      different than those found in semantic or perceptual false memory paradigms,
      results suggest that associative false memories are mediated by similar neural
      mechanisms. Specifically, we found increased frontal activity that likely
      represents enhanced monitoring and evaluation compared to that needed for true
      memories and correct rejections. Results also indicated that true, and not false 
      associative memories, are mediated by neural activity in the MTL, specifically
      the hippocampus. Finally, while activity in early visual cortex distinguished
      true from false memories, a lack of neural differences between hits and correct
      rejections failed to support previous findings suggesting that activity in early 
      visual cortex represents sensory reactivation of encoding-related processing.

      a multi-channel NIRS study.

AB  - Multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive and low-cost
      functional neuroimaging technique in psychiatric research, and it has been wildly
      used for detecting the spatiotemporal characteristics of brain activity. In order
      to evaluate the clinical value of NIRS data in the assistant diagnosis of major
      depressive disorder (MDD), prefrontal cortex (PFC) hemoglobin concentration
      exchange of 30 MDD patients combined with anxious and obsessive-compulsive
      symptom was detected by NIRS under voice fluency task (VFT), then the
      relationship between the severity of depressive, anxious and obsessive-compulsive
      symptom assessed by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety
      Rating Scale (HAMA) and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) with NIRS 
      data in PFC was analyzed. Hypoactivation in lateral and lower PFC of MDD patients
      was confirmed in this study. Furthermore, Spearman correlation found that
      oxy-hemoglobin concentration ([oxy-Hb]) exchange in right-lateral PFC was
      associated with the severity of anxiety, while bilateral PFC and antero-medial
      PFC were associated with severity of depression. Meanwhile, no statistical
      correlation was observed on the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptom. The
      results prompted that MDD patients with anxiety and obsession-compulsion symptom 
      showed a PFC hypoactivation state in NIRS. Furthermore, the function of
      right-lateral PFC was associated with anxiety symptom, while bilateral PFC and
      antero-medial PFC were associated with depression symptom. Different from
      depression and anxiety, obsession-compulsion may have a different biological
      character in PFC function.

AB  - Flow is the holistic experience felt when an individual acts with total
      involvement. Although flow is likely associated with many functions of the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), such as attention, emotion, and reward processing, no
      study has directly investigated the activity of the PFC during flow. The
      objective of this study was to examine activity in the PFC during the flow state 
      using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty right-handed
      university students performed a video game task under conditions designed to
      induce psychological states of flow and boredom. During each task and when
      completing the flow state scale for occupational tasks, change in oxygenated
      hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration in frontal brain regions was measured using
      fNIRS. During the flow condition, oxy-Hb concentration was significantly
      increased in the right and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Oxy-Hb
      concentration tended to decrease in the boredom condition. There was a
      significant increase in oxy-Hb concentration in the right and left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex, right and left frontal pole areas, and left ventrolateral PFC 
      when participants were completing the flow state scale after performing the task 
      in the flow condition. In conclusion, flow is associated with activity of the
      PFC, and may therefore be associated with functions such as cognition, emotion,
      maintenance of internal goals, and reward processing.

TI  - Adolescent alcohol exposure reduces behavioral flexibility, promotes
      disinhibition, and increases resistance to extinction of ethanol
      self-administration in adulthood.
PG  - 2570-83
LID - 10.1038/npp.2014.109 [doi]
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a brain region that is critically involved in
      cognitive function and inhibitory control of behavior, and adolescence represents
      an important period of continued PFC development that parallels the maturation of
      these functions. Evidence suggests that this period of continued development of
      the PFC may render it especially vulnerable to environmental insults that impact 
      PFC function in adulthood. Experimentation with alcohol typically begins during
      adolescence when binge-like consumption of large quantities is common. In the
      present study, we investigated the effects of repeated cycles of adolescent
      intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure (postnatal days 28-42) by vapor inhalation on
      different aspects of executive functioning in the adult rat. In an operant
      set-shifting task, AIE-exposed rats exhibited deficits in their ability to shift 
      their response strategy when the rules of the task changed, indicating reduced
      behavioral flexibility. There were no differences in progressive ratio response
      for the reinforcer suggesting that AIE did not alter reinforcer motivation.
      Examination of performance on the elevated plus maze under conditions designed to
      minimize stress revealed that AIE exposure enhanced the number of entries into
      the open arms, which may reflect either reduced anxiety and/or disinhibition of
      exploratory-like behavior. In rats that trained to self-administer ethanol in an 
      operant paradigm, AIE increased resistance to extinction of ethanol-seeking
      behavior. This resistance to extinction was reversed by positive allosteric
      modulation of mGluR5 during extinction training, an effect that is thought to
      reflect promotion of extinction learning mechanisms within the medial PFC.
      Consistent with this, CDPPB was also observed to reverse the deficits in
      behavioral flexibility. Finally, diffusion tensor imaging with multivariate
      analysis of 32 brain areas revealed that while there were no differences in the
      total brain volume, the volume of a subgroup of regions (hippocampus, thalamus,
      dorsal striatum, neocortex, and hypothalamus) were significantly different in
      AIE-exposed adults compared with litter-matched Control rats. Taken together,
      these findings demonstrate that binge-like exposure to alcohol during early to
      middle adolescence results in deficits in PFC-mediated behavioral control in
      adulthood.

AB  - Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) are prevalent childhood disorders that frequently co-occur.
      Evidence from neuroimaging research suggests that children with these disorders
      exhibit disruptions in motor circuitry, which could account for the high rate of 
      co-occurrence. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the
      functional connections of the motor network in children with DCD and/or ADHD
      compared to typically developing controls, with the aim of identifying common
      neurophysiological substrates. Resting-state fMRI was performed on seven children
      with DCD, 21 with ADHD, 18 with DCD + ADHD and 23 controls. Resting-state
      connectivity of the primary motor cortex was compared between each group and
      controls, using age as a co-factor. Relative to controls, children with DCD
      and/or ADHD exhibited similar reductions in functional connectivity between the
      primary motor cortex and the bilateral inferior frontal gyri, right supramarginal
      gyrus, angular gyri, insular cortices, amygdala, putamen, and pallidum. In
      addition, children with DCD and/or ADHD exhibited different age-related patterns 
      of connectivity, compared to controls. These findings suggest that children with 
      DCD and/or ADHD exhibit disruptions in motor circuitry, which may contribute to
      problems with motor functioning and attention. Our results support the existence 
      of common neurophysiological substrates underlying both motor and attention
      problems.

AB  - We use a biologically grounded neural network model to investigate the brain
      mechanisms underlying individual differences specific to the selection and
      instantiation of representations that exert cognitive control in task switching. 
      Existing computational models of task switching do not focus on individual
      differences and so cannot explain why task switching abilities are separable from
      other executive function (EF) abilities (such as response inhibition). We explore
      hypotheses regarding neural mechanisms underlying the "Shifting-Specific" and
      "Common EF" components of EF proposed in the Unity/Diversity model (Miyake &
      Friedman, 2012) and similar components in related theoretical frameworks. We do
      so by adapting a well-developed neural network model of working memory
      (Prefrontal cortex, Basal ganglia Working Memory or PBWM; Hazy, Frank, &
      O'Reilly, 2007) to task switching and the Stroop task, and comparing its behavior
      on those tasks under a variety of individual difference manipulations. Results
      are consistent with the hypotheses that variation specific to task switching
      (i.e., Shifting-Specific) may be related to uncontrolled, automatic persistence
      of goal representations, whereas variation general to multiple EFs (i.e., Common 
      EF) may be related to the strength of PFC representations and their effect on
      processing in the remainder of the cognitive system. Moreover, increasing signal 
      to noise ratio in PFC, theoretically tied to levels of tonic dopamine and a
      genetic polymorphism in the COMT gene, reduced Stroop interference but increased 
      switch costs. This stability-flexibility tradeoff provides an explanation for why
      these two EF components sometimes show opposing correlations with other variables
      such as attention problems and self-restraint.

TI  - Impaired facial emotion recognition in patients with ventromedial prefrontal
      hypoperfusion.
PG  - 605-12
LID - 10.1037/neu0000057 [doi]
AB  - Empathy refers to our ability to recognize and share emotions by another human
      being. Impairment may underlie many of the emotional deficits commonly associated
      with a range of neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. The prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) has long been implicated in these processes, but the specific
      contribution of subregions of the PFC remain unclear. Studies regarding the role 
      of subregions of the prefrontal cortex such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
      (vmPFC)-in facial emotion recognition have yielded inconsistent results. The
      present study aimed to investigate the capacity to recognize nonverbal emotional 
      facial expressions in a group of patients with the following: (a) perfusion
      deficits in the vmPFC (vmPFC group; N = 13), (b) hypoperfusions sparing the vmPFC
      (nonvmPFC group; N = 12), and in (c) a control group of healthy volunteers
      (control group; N = 17). Regions of hypoperfusion were identified by means of
      Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). Participants were asked to
      recognize facial expressions of the 7 basic emotions (happiness, fear, surprise, 
      anger, disgust, sadness, or neutral). Detection of facial expressions of fear,
      disgust, and surprise was affected after functional disruption of the vmPFC. The 
      present study confirms the role of the vmPFC in recognizing emotional facial
      expressions.

AB  - Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a debilitating, idiopathic chronic pain
      condition. For many BMS patients, burning oral pain begins in late morning and
      becomes more intense throughout the day, peaking by late afternoon or evening. We
      investigated brain gray matter volume (GMV) with voxel-based morphometry (VBM),
      white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and 
      functional connectivity in resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) in a tightly
      screened, homogeneous sample of 9 female, postmenopausal/perimenopausal BMS
      patients and 9 matched healthy control subjects. Patients underwent 2 scanning
      sessions in the same day: in the morning, when ongoing pain/burning was low, and 
      in the afternoon, when pain/burning was significantly higher. Patients had
      increased GMV and lower FA in the hippocampus (Hc), and decreased GMV in the
      medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). rsfMRI revealed altered connectivity patterns in
      different states of pain/burning, with increased connectivity between mPFC (a
      node in the default mode network) and anterior cingulate cortex, occipital
      cortex, ventromedial PFC, and bilateral Hc/amygdala in the afternoon compared
      with the morning session. Furthermore, mPFC-Hc connectivity was higher in BMS
      patients than control subjects for the afternoon but not the morning session.
      mPFC-Hc connectivity was related to Beck depression inventory scores both between
      groups and between burning states within patients, suggesting that depression and
      anxiety partially explain pain-related brain dysfunction in BMS. Overall, we
      provide multiple lines of evidence supporting aberrant structure and function in 
      the mPFC and Hc, and implicate a circuit involving the mPFC and Hc in regulating 
      mood and depressive symptoms in BMS.

TI  - All competition is not alike: neural mechanisms for resolving underdetermined and
      prepotent competition.
PG  - 2608-23
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00652 [doi]
AB  - People must constantly select among potential thoughts and actions in the face of
      competition from (a) multiple task-relevant options (underdetermined competition)
      and (b) strongly dominant options that are not appropriate in the current context
      (prepotent competition). These types of competition are ubiquitous during
      language production. In this work, we investigate the neural mechanisms that
      allow individuals to effectively manage these cognitive control demands and to
      quickly choose words with few errors. Using fMRI, we directly contrast
      underdetermined and prepotent competition within the same task (verb generation) 
      for the first time, allowing localization of the neural substrates supporting the
      resolution of these two types of competition. Using a neural network model, we
      investigate the possible mechanisms by which these brain regions support
      selection. Together, our findings demonstrate that all competition is not alike: 
      resolving prepotent competition and resolving underdetermined competition rely on
      partly dissociable neural substrates and mechanisms. Specifically, activation of 
      left ventrolateral pFC is specific to resolving underdetermined competition
      between multiple appropriate responses, most likely via competitive lateral
      inhibition. In contrast, activation of left dorsolateral pFC is sensitive to both
      underdetermined competition and prepotent competition from response options that 
      are inappropriate in the current context. This region likely provides top-down
      support for task-relevant responses, which enables them to out-compete prepotent 
      responses in the selection process that occurs in left ventrolateral pFC.

      depression. Emerging findings indicate ELT is associated with enhanced amygdala
      reactivity to aversive stimuli in never-depressed healthy controls as well as
      those with acute depression but may be absent in non-ELT exposed depressed. The
      precise mechanism mediating these differences in amygdala reactivity remains
      unclear. METHOD: The authors used Granger causality methods to evaluate
      task-based directional connectivity between medial or lateral prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) and amygdala in 20 unmedicated patients with current major depressive
      disorder (MDD) and 19 healthy matched controls while participants engaged in an
      affective variant of the flanker task comparing response to sad and neutral
      faces. These data were correlated with childhood trauma history. RESULTS:
      Exposure to ELT was associated with failure of inhibition within the MDD group
      based on medial PFC-amygdala connectivity. In contrast, non-ELT exposed MDD was
      associated with a negative causal pathway from medial prefrontal cortex to
      amygdala, despite reduced dorsolateral PFC input in comparison to healthy
      controls. Neither MDD group demonstrated significant lateral PFC-amygdala
      connectivity in comparison to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Failure of the
      circuit implicated in emotion regulation was associated with a significant
      history of ELT but not with MDD more broadly. Non-ELT related depression was
      associated with intact regulation of emotion despite the absence of difference in
      severity of illness. These findings indicate opposing system-level differences
      within depression relative to ELT are expressed as differential amygdala
      reactivity.

AB  - Problem-solving is an executive function subserved by a network of neural
      structures of which the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is central.
      Whereas several studies have evaluated the role of the DLPFC in problem-solving, 
      few standardized tasks have been developed specifically for use with functional
      neuroimaging. The current study adapted a measure with established validity for
      the assessment of problem-solving abilities to design a test more suitable for
      functional neuroimaging protocols. The Scarborough adaptation of the Tower of
      London (S-TOL) was administered to 38 healthy adults while hemodynamic
      oxygenation of the PFC was measured using 16-channel continuous-wave functional
      near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Compared to a baseline condition, problems
      that required two or three steps to achieve a goal configuration were associated 
      with higher activation in the left DLPFC and deactivation in the medial PFC.
      Individuals scoring higher in trait deliberation showed consistently higher
      activation in the left DLPFC regardless of task difficulty, whereas individuals
      lower in this trait displayed less activation when solving simple problems. Based
      on these results, the S-TOL may serve as a standardized task to evaluate
      problem-solving abilities in functional neuroimaging studies.

TI  - Thalamocortical connections between the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and
      prefrontal cortex in the human brain: a diffusion tensor tractographic study.
PG  - 709-14
LID - 10.3349/ymj.2014.55.3.709 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The elucidation of thalamocortical connections between the mediodorsal
      nucleus (MD) of thalamus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is important in the
      clinical fields of neurorehabilitation and psychiatry. However, little is known
      about these connections in human brain. We attempted to identify and investigate 
      the anatomical characteristics of the thalamocortical connection between MD and
      PFC in human brain using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Thirty-two healthy volunteers were recruited for this study. Diffusion
      tensor images were scanned using a 1.5-T. A seed region of interest was placed at
      the MD of the thalamus on coronal images, and target regions of interest were
      placed on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the ventrolateral
      prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), respectively. The 
      three thalamocortical connections found were reconstructed using Functional
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) software. RESULTS: The three
      thalamocortical connections were arranged in subcortical white matter in the
      following order from upper to lower levels: the DLPFC, the VLPFC, and the OFC. In
      terms of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values, no significant
      differences were observed between the DLPFC, VLPFC and OFC (p>0.05). In contrast,
      the OFC tract volume was higher than those of the DLPFC and the VLPFC (p<0.05).
      CONCLUSION: Three thalamocortical connections were reconstructed between MD and
      PFCs in human brain using DTT. We believe that the results of this study would be
      helpful to clinicians in treating frontal network syndrome and psychiatric
      diseases.

TI  - Frontoparietal function in young people with dysthymic disorder (DSM-5:
      Persistent depressive disorder) during spatial working memory.
PG  - 34-42

LID - S0165-0327(14)00077-9 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysthymic disorder (DD) is a depressive disorder characterised by
      persistent low and/or irritable mood and has been identified as a major risk
      factor for developing major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD and DD have been
      associated with executive function difficulties of working memory and attention. 
      Little is known about how executive function networks in the brain are affected
      in children and adolescents with MDD and even less in DD. This study used fMRI
      and two spatial working memory paradigms to investigate associated brain function
      in young people with DD and an age-, gender- and IQ- matched typically developing
      group. METHODS: Nineteen male patients with DD (mean age 11.2+/-1.5 years)
      diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria and 16 typically developing boys (mean age
      10.5+/-1.1 years) performed a mental rotation and a delay-match to sample (DMTS) 
      task while undergoing fMRI. All participants were medication-naive at the time of
      testing. RESULTS: Compared to typically developing young people, the DD group
      showed less activation in left frontal regions including left ventro- and
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (PFC) during mental rotation. Medial frontal
      regions including dorsomedial PFC, anterior cingulate cortex and frontal pole
      also showed relatively reduced activation. During the DMTS task patients showed
      significantly more activation in the right precuneus and posterior cingulate
      cortex. LIMITATIONS: This was a cross-sectional study with a small sample
      limiting the generalizability of the results. CONCLUSIONS: The results complement
      previous findings in adults with MDD that have shown differential activation of
      left PFC regions during working memory tasks. Additionally, altered function of
      cortical midline structures in young patients with DD was identified. This
      supports findings in children, adolescents and adults with MDD suggesting that
      the pathophysiology of depressive disorders extends to DD as a risk factor for
      MDD and exhibits continuity over the lifespan.

      academic performance.
PG  - 2250-61
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00630 [doi]
AB  - The acquisition and retention of conceptual knowledge is more effective in
      well-structured curricula that provide an optimal conceptual framework for
      learning new material. However, the neural mechanisms by which preexisting
      conceptual schemas facilitate learning are not yet well understood despite their 
      fundamental importance. A preexisting schema has been shown to enhance memory by 
      influencing the balance between activity within the medial-temporal lobe and the 
      medial pFC during mnemonic processes such as encoding, consolidation, and
      retrieval. Specifically, correctly encoding and retrieving information that is
      related to preexisting schemas appears rather related to medial prefrontal
      processing, whereas information unrelated or inconsistent with preexisting
      schemas rather relates to enhanced medial temporal processing and enhanced
      interaction between these structures. To further investigate interactions between
      these regions during conceptual encoding in a real-world university setting, we
      probed human brain activity and connectivity using fMRI during educationally
      relevant conceptual encoding carefully embedded within two course programs. Early
      second-year undergraduate biology and education students were scanned while
      encoding new facts that were either related or unrelated to the preexisting
      conceptual knowledge they had acquired during their first year of study.
      Subsequently, they were tested on their knowledge of these facts 24 hr later.
      Memory scores were better for course-related information, and this enhancement
      was associated with larger medial-prefrontal, but smaller medial-temporal
      subsequent memory effects. These activity differences went along with decreased
      functional interactions between these regions. Furthermore, schema-related
      medial-prefrontal subsequent memory effects measured during this experiment were 
      found to be predictive of second-year course performance. These results, obtained
      in a real-world university setting, reveal brain mechanisms underlying
      acquisition of new knowledge that can be integrated into preexisting conceptual
      schemas and may indicate how relevant this process is for study success.

TI  - The common traits of the ACC and PFC in anxiety disorders in the DSM-5:
      meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies.
PG  - e93432
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0093432 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The core domains of social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized
      anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD) with and without agoraphobia (GA),
      and specific phobia (SP) are cognitive and physical symptoms that are related to 
      the experience of fear and anxiety. It remains unclear whether these highly
      comorbid conditions that constitute the anxiety disorder subgroups of the
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders--Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
      represent distinct disorders or alternative presentations of a single underlying 
      pathology. METHODS: A systematic search of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies 
      of SAD, GAD, PD, GA, and SP was performed with an effect-size signed differential
      mapping (ES-SDM) meta-analysis to estimate the clusters of significant gray
      matter differences between patients and controls. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies
      were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Reductions in the right
      anterior cingulate gyrus and the left inferior frontal gyrus gray matter volumes 
      (GMVs) were noted in patients with anxiety disorders when potential confounders, 
      such as comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD), age, and antidepressant use
      were controlled for. We also demonstrated increased GMVs in the right
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in comorbid depression-anxiety (CDA),
      drug-naive and adult patients. Furthermore, we identified a reduced left middle
      temporal gyrus and right precentral gyrus in anxiety patients without comorbid
      MDD. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that a reduced volume of the right ventral
      anterior cingulate gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus is common in anxiety
      disorders and is independent of comorbid depression, medication use, and age.
      This generic effect supports the notion that the four types of anxiety disorders 
      have a clear degree of overlap that may reflect shared etiological mechanisms.
      The results are consistent with neuroanatomical DLPFC models of physiological
      responses, such as worry and fear, and the importance of the ventral anterior
      cingulate (ACC)/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mediating anxiety symptoms.

AB  - The ability to simultaneously acquire objective physiological measures of emotion
      concurrent with fMRI holds the promise to enhance our understanding of the
      biological bases of affect and thus improve our knowledge of the neural circuitry
      underlying psychiatric disorders. However, the vast majority of neuroimaging
      studies to date examining emotion have not anchored the examination of
      emotion-responding circuitry to objective measures of emotional processing. To
      that end, we acquired EMG activity of a valence-sensitive facial muscle involved 
      in the frowning response (corrugator muscle) concurrent with fMRI while
      twenty-six human participants viewed negative and neutral images. Trial-by-trial 
      increases in corrugator EMG activity to negative pictures were associated with
      greater amygdala activity and a concurrent decrease in ventromedial PFC activity.
      Thus, this study highlights the reciprocal relation between amygdalar and
      ventromedial PFC in the encoding of emotional valence as reflected by facial
      expression.

AB  - When we decide between two options, we can make our decision based on what we
      prefer, (preference-based choice), or we can also choose based on which option we
      want to avoid more (non-preference-based choice). Most decision making research
      has examined preference-based choice but has not differentiated it from
      non-preference-based choice. The decision making process can be decomposed into
      multiple value-based computational processes, which are shown to be subserved by 
      different regions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here we show that the same
      decision circuits within the PFC are configured differently depending on whether 
      decisions are made based on preference or non-preference criteria (decision
      rule). Activation in the dorsolateral PFC changed depending on both the values of
      the two choice options and decision rule. We also found that activation in the
      medial and lateral PFC was modulated linearly according to the difference in
      value between the two items and according to the value of the chosen item,
      respectively. In the medial and lateral PFC, there were distinct patterns of
      activation between dorsal and ventral regions: in dorsal regions value-related
      changes in activation were modulated by the decision rule, whereas in ventral
      regions activation patterns were not modulated. We propose that preference and
      non-preference decision rules represented in the dorsal PFC differently configure
      decision processes, resulting in context-specific significance being attached to 
      the choice values represented in the ventral PFC.

AB  - Intentionality is the ability to explain and predict the behaviour of others by
      attributing to them mental states, and is thus important for social cognition.
      Prefrontal cortex (PFC) including orbital and dorsal regions is implicated in a
      range of social and metacognitive executive functions (EFs). We investigate, for 
      the first time, in 39 left-handers and 43 right-handers the effect of handedness 
      on the relationship between intentionality and (i) PFC volume using stereology
      and (ii) grey matter (GM) volume within six a priori regions of interest using
      voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Although no association was found between degree
      of handedness and intentionality competence (p = .17), handedness groups differ
      significantly in the relationship between intentionality and PFC volume.
      Right-handers with handedness score =+75 (based on a range from -100 to +100)
      show a significant positive correlation between intentionality and orbital PFC
      volume (p = .01), while no significant correlation is observed for dorsal PFC
      volume (p = .82); and left-handers with handedness score =-75 show a significant 
      positive correlation between intentionality and dorsal PFC volume (p = .02) while
      no significant correlation is observed for orbital PFC volume (p = .44). VBM
      results showed significantly greater GM volume correlated with intentionality in 
      right-handers compared to left-handers (family-wise error - FWE, p < .05) in
      right temporo-parietal junction and superior temporal sulcus. Correlations
      between GM volume and intentionality were found across all subjects (FWE, p <
      .05) in bilateral middle frontal gyrus, superior temporal sulcus and right
      inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and precuneus. Overall, the
      findings suggest that the neuroanatomy underlying intentionality competence is
      influenced by handedness and that different methodological approaches can and
      should be considered in conjunction when investigating neuroanatomical correlates
      of psychological functioning.

AB  - Cognitive conflict detection and resolution develops with age across childhood
      and likely supports age-related increases in other aspects of cognitive and
      emotional development. Little is known about the neural correlates of conflict
      detection and resolution in early childhood. In the current study, we
      investigated age-related change in neural recruitment during a blocked
      spatial-incompatibility task (Simon task) in children ages 5-10 years using fMRI.
      Cortical thickness was measured using structural MRI. Across all children, there 
      was greater activation in right prefrontal and bilateral parietal cortices for
      incompatible than compatible conditions. In older children, compared with younger
      children, there was decreased activation and decreased gray matter thickness in
      the medial PFC. Thickness and activation changes across age were associated
      within participants, such that thinner cortex was associated with less activation
      in the rostral ACC. These findings suggest that developmental change in medial
      PFC activation supports performance on cognitive control tasks in early
      childhood.

      CNS-acting drugs, a rat phMRI BOLD study.
PG  - 995-1000
LID - 10.1038/jcbfm.2014.47 [doi]
AB  - Concordant results of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral
      tests prove that some non-blood-brain barrier-penetrating drugs produce robust
      central nervous system (CNS) effects. The anticholinergic scopolamine interferes 
      with learning when tested in rats, which coincides with a negative
      blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) change in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as
      demonstrated by fMRI. The peripherally acting butylscopolamine also evokes a
      learning deficit in a water-labyrinth test and provokes a negative BOLD signal in
      the PFC. Donepezil-a highly CNS-penetrating cholinesterase inhibitor-prevents the
      negative BOLD and cognitive deficits regardless whether the provoking agent is
      scopolamine or butylscopolamine. Interestingly, the non-BBB-penetrating
      cholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine also prevents or substantially inhibits
      those cognitive and fMRI changes. Intact cerebral blood flow and optimal
      metabolism are crucial for the normal functioning of neurons and other cells in
      the brain. Drugs that are not BBB penetrating yet act on the CNS highlight the
      importance of unimpaired circulation, and point to the cerebral vasculature as a 
      primary target for drug action in diseases where impaired circulation and
      consequently suboptimal energy metabolism are followed by upstream pathologic
      events.

TI  - A review of fMRI studies during visual emotive processing in major depressive
      disorder.
AB  - Objectives. This review synthesized literature on brain activity, indexed by
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), during visual affective information
      processing in major depressive disorder (MDD). Activation was examined in regions
      consistently implicated in emotive processing, including the anterior cingulate
      cortex (ACC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, thalamus/basal ganglia and
      hippocampus. We also reviewed the effects of antidepressant interventions on
      brain activity during emotive processing. Methods. Sixty-four fMRI studies
      investigating neural activity during visual emotive information processing in MDD
      were included. Results. Evidence indicates increased ventro-rostral ACC activity 
      to emotive stimuli and perhaps decreased dorsal ACC activity in MDD. Findings are
      inconsistent for the PFC, though medial PFC hyperactivity tends to emerge to
      emotive information processing in the disorder. Depressed patients display
      increased amygdala activation to negative and arousing stimuli. MDD may also be
      associated with increased activity to negative, and decreased activity to
      positive, stimuli in basal ganglia/thalamic structures. Finally, there may be
      increased hippocampus activation during negative information processing.
      Typically, antidepressant interventions normalize these activation patterns.
      Conclusion. In general, depressed patients have increased activation to emotive, 
      especially negative, visual stimuli in regions involved in affective processing, 
      with the exception of certain PFC regions; this pattern tends to normalize with
      treatment.

TI  - Bad and worse: neural systems underlying reappraisal of high- and low-intensity
      negative emotions.
PG  - 172-9
LID - 10.1093/scan/nsu043 [doi]
AB  - One of the most effective strategies for regulating emotional responses is
      cognitive reappraisal. While prior work has made great strides in characterizing 
      reappraisal's neural mechanisms and behavioral outcomes, the key issue of how
      regulation varies as a function of emotional intensity remains unaddressed. We
      compared the behavioral and neural correlates of reappraisal of high- and
      low-intensity emotional responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI). We found that successful reappraisal of both high- and low-intensity
      emotions depends upon recruitment of dorsomedial (dmPFC) as well as left
      dorsolateral (dlPFC) and ventrolateral (vlPFC) prefrontal cortex. However,
      reappraisal of high-intensity emotions more strongly activated left dlPFC, and in
      addition, activated right lateral and dorsomedial PFC regions not recruited by
      low-intensity reappraisal. No brain regions were more strongly recruited during
      reappraisal of low when compared with high-intensity emotions. Taken together,
      these results suggest that reappraisal of high-intensity emotion requires greater
      cognitive resources as evidenced by quantitative and qualitative differences in
      prefrontal recruitment. These data have implications for understanding how and
      when specific PFC systems are needed to regulate different types of emotional
      responses.

TI  - Sensitivity of fNIRS to cognitive state and load.
PG  - 76
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00076 [doi]
AB  - Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging low-cost noninvasive
      neuroimaging technique that measures cortical bloodflow. While fNIRS has gained
      interest as a potential alternative to fMRI for use with clinical and pediatric
      populations, it remains unclear whether fNIRS has the necessary sensitivity to
      serve as a replacement for fMRI. The present study set out to examine whether
      fNIRS has the sensitivity to detect linear changes in activation and functional
      connectivity in response to cognitive load, and functional connectivity changes
      when transitioning from a task-free resting state to a task. Sixteen young adult 
      subjects were scanned with a continuous-wave fNIRS system during a 10-min
      resting-state scan followed by a letter n-back task with three load conditions.
      Five optical probes were placed over frontal and parietal cortices, covering
      bilateral dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), bilateral ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC),
      frontopolar cortex (FP), and bilateral parietal cortex. Activation was found to
      scale linearly with working memory load in bilateral prefrontal cortex.
      Functional connectivity increased with increasing n-back loads for
      fronto-parietal, interhemispheric dlPFC, and local connections. Functional
      connectivity differed between the resting state scan and the n-back scan, with
      fronto-parietal connectivity greater during the n-back, and interhemispheric
      vlPFC connectivity greater during rest. These results demonstrate that fNIRS is
      sensitive to both cognitive load and state, suggesting that fNIRS is well-suited 
      to explore the full complement of neuroimaging research questions and will serve 
      as a viable alternative to fMRI.

TI  - Seeing Jesus in toast: neural and behavioral correlates of face pareidolia.
PG  - 60-77

LID - S0010-9452(14)00028-8 [pii]
AB  - Face pareidolia is the illusory perception of non-existent faces. The present
      study, for the first time, contrasted behavioral and neural responses of face
      pareidolia with those of letter pareidolia to explore face-specific behavioral
      and neural responses during illusory face processing. Participants were shown
      pure-noise images but were led to believe that 50% of them contained either faces
      or letters; they reported seeing faces or letters illusorily 34% and 38% of the
      time, respectively. The right fusiform face area (rFFA) showed a specific
      response when participants "saw" faces as opposed to letters in the pure-noise
      images. Behavioral responses during face pareidolia produced a classification
      image (CI) that resembled a face, whereas those during letter pareidolia produced
      a CI that was letter-like. Further, the extent to which such behavioral CIs
      resembled faces was directly related to the level of face-specific activations in
      the rFFA. This finding suggests that the rFFA plays a specific role not only in
      processing of real faces but also in illusory face perception, perhaps serving to
      facilitate the interaction between bottom-up information from the primary visual 
      cortex and top-down signals from the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Whole brain
      analyses revealed a network specialized in face pareidolia, including both the
      frontal and occipitotemporal regions. Our findings suggest that human face
      processing has a strong top-down component whereby sensory input with even the
      slightest suggestion of a face can result in the interpretation of a face.

AB  - Lesion studies link the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to executive functions. However, 
      the evidence from in vivo investigations in healthy people is mixed, and there
      are no quantitative estimates of the association strength. To examine the
      relationship between PFC volume and cortical thickness with executive cognition
      in healthy adults, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies that assessed
      executive functions and PFC volume (31 samples,) and PFC thickness (10 samples)
      in vivo, N=3272 participants. We found that larger PFC volume and greater PFC
      thickness were associated with better executive performance. Stronger
      associations between executive functions and PFC volume were linked to greater
      variance in the sample age but was unrelated to the mean age of a sample.
      Strength of association between cognitive and neuroanatomical indices depended on
      the executive task used in the study. PFC volume correlated stronger with
      Wisconsin Card Sorting Test than with digit backwards span, Trail Making Test and
      verbal fluency. Significant effect size was observed in lateral and medial but
      not orbital PFC. The results support the "bigger is better" hypothesis of
      brain-behavior relation in healthy adults and suggest different neural correlates
      across the neuropsychological tests used to assess executive functions.

TI  - Activity in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala underlies individual differences
      in prosocial and individualistic economic choices.

LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00589 [doi]
AB  - Much decision-making requires balancing benefits to the self with benefits to the
      group. There are marked individual differences in this balance such that
      individualists tend to favor themselves whereas prosocials tend to favor the
      group. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this difference has important
      implications for society and its institutions. Using behavioral and fMRI data
      collected during the performance of the ultimatum game, we show that individual
      differences in social preferences for resource allocation, so-called "social
      value orientation," is linked with activity in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala
      elicited by inequity, rather than activity in insula, ACC, and dorsolateral pFC. 
      Importantly, the presence of cognitive load made prosocials behave more
      prosocially and individualists more individualistically, suggesting that social
      value orientation is driven more by intuition than reflection. In parallel,
      activity in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala, in response to inequity, tracked 
      this behavioral pattern of prosocials and individualists. In addition, we
      conducted an impunity game experiment with different participants where they
      could not punish unfair behavior and found that the inequity-correlated activity 
      seen in prosocials during the ultimatum game disappeared. This result suggests
      that the accumbens and amygdala activity of prosocials encodes "outcome-oriented 
      emotion" designed to change situations (i.e., achieve equity or punish).
      Together, our results suggest a pivotal contribution of the nucleus accumbens and
      amygdala to individual differences in sociality.

TI  - The role of right prefrontal and medial cortex in response inhibition:
      interfering with action restraint and action cancellation using transcranial
      magnetic brain stimulation.
PG  - 1775-84
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00595 [doi]
AB  - The ability of inhibiting impulsive urges is paramount for human behavior. Such
      successful response inhibition has consistently been associated with activity in 
      pFC. The current study aims to unravel the differential involvement of different 
      areas within right pFC for successful action restraint versus action
      cancellation. These two conceptually different aspects of action inhibition were 
      measured with a go/no-go task (action restraint) and a stop signal task (action
      cancellation). Localization of relevant prefrontal activation was based on fMRI
      data. Significant task-related activation during successful action restraint was 
      localized for each participant individually in right anterior insula (rAI), right
      superior frontal gyrus, and pre-SMA. Activation during successful action
      cancellation was localized in rAI, right middle frontal gyrus, and pre-SMA.
      Subsequently, fMRI-guided continuous thetaburst stimulation was applied to these 
      regions. Results showed that the disruption of neural activity in rAI reduced
      both the ability to restrain (go/no-go) and cancel (stop signal) responses. In
      contrast, continuous thetaburst stimulation-induced disruption of the right
      superior frontal gyrus specifically impaired the ability to restrain from
      responding (go/no-go), while leaving the ability for action cancellation largely 
      intact. Stimulation applied to right middle frontal gyrus and pre-SMA did not
      affect inhibitory processing in neither of the two tasks. These findings provide 
      a more comprehensive perspective on the role of pFC in inhibition and cognitive
      control. The results emphasize the role of inferior frontal regions for global
      inhibition, whereas superior frontal regions seem to be specifically relevant for
      successful action restraint.

TI  - The neural coding of feedback learning across child and adolescent development.

AB  - The ability to learn from environmental cues is an important contributor to
      successful performance in a variety of settings, including school. Despite the
      progress in unraveling the neural correlates of cognitive control in childhood
      and adolescence, relatively little is known about how these brain regions
      contribute to learning. In this study, 268 participants aged 8-25 years performed
      a rule-learning task with performance feedback in a 3T MRI scanner. We examined
      the development of the frontoparietal network during feedback learning by
      exploring contributions of age and pubertal development. The pFC showed more
      activation following negative compared with positive feedback with increasing
      age. In contrast, our data suggested that the parietal cortex demonstrated a
      shift from sensitivity to positive feedback in young children to negative
      feedback in adolescents and adults. These findings were interpreted in terms of
      separable contributions of the frontoparietal network in childhood to more
      integrated functions in adulthood. Puberty (testosterone, estradiol, and
      self-report) did not explain additional variance in neural activation patterns
      above age, suggesting that development of the frontoparietal network occurs
      relatively independently from hormonal development. This study presents novel
      insights into the development of learning, moving beyond a simple frontoparietal 
      immaturity hypothesis.

AB  - Convergent evidence suggests that corticostriatal interactions act as a gate to
      select the input to working memory (WM). However, not all information in WM is
      relevant for behavior simultaneously. For this reason, a second "output gate"
      might advantageously govern which contents of WM influence behavior. Here, we
      test whether frontostriatal circuits previously implicated in input gating also
      support output gating during selection from WM. fMRI of a hierarchical rule task 
      with dissociable input and output gating demands demonstrated greater lateral
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) recruitment and frontostriatal connectivity during output
      gating. Moreover, PFC and striatum correlated with distinct behavioral profiles. 
      Whereas PFC recruitment correlated with mean efficiency of selection from WM,
      striatal recruitment and frontostriatal interactions correlated with its
      reliability, as though such dynamics stochastically gate WM's output. These
      results support the output gating hypothesis, suggesting that contextual
      representations in PFC influence striatum to select which information in WM
      drives responding.

TI  - Valence-specific conflict moderation in the dorso-medial PFC and the caudate head
      in emotional speech.
PG  - 165-71
LID - 10.1093/scan/nsu021 [doi]
AB  - Emotional speech comprises of complex multimodal verbal and non-verbal
      information that allows deducting others' emotional states or thoughts in social 
      interactions. While the neural correlates of verbal and non-verbal aspects and
      their interaction in emotional speech have been identified, there is very little 
      evidence on how we perceive and resolve incongruity in emotional speech, and
      whether such incongruity extends to current concepts of task-specific prediction 
      errors as a consequence of unexpected action outcomes ('negative surprise').
      Here, we explored this possibility while participants listened to congruent and
      incongruent angry, happy or neutral utterances and categorized the expressed
      emotions by their verbal (semantic) content. Results reveal valence-specific
      incongruity effects: negative verbal content expressed in a happy tone of voice
      increased activation in the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) extending its 
      role from conflict moderation to appraisal of valence-specific conflict in
      emotional speech. Conversely, the caudate head bilaterally responded selectively 
      to positive verbal content expressed in an angry tone of voice broadening
      previous accounts of the caudate head in linguistic control to moderating
      valence-specific control in emotional speech. Together, these results suggest
      that control structures of the human brain (dmPFC and subcompartments of the
      basal ganglia) impact emotional speech differentially when conflict arises.

AB  - Neurobiological models suggest that adolescents are driven by an overactive
      ventral striatum (VS) response to rewards that may lead to an adolescent increase
      in risk-taking behavior. However, empirical studies showed mixed findings of
      adolescents' brain response to rewards. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the 
      relationship between reward-related brain activation and risky decision-making.
      In addition, we examined effects of age, puberty, and individuals' reward
      sensitivity. We collected two datasets: Experiment 1 reports cross-sectional
      brain data from 75 participants (ages 10-25) who played a risky decision task.
      Experiment 2 presents a longitudinal extension in which a subset of these
      adolescents (n=33) was measured again 2years later. Results showed that (1) a
      reward-related network including VS and medial PFC was consistently activated
      over time, (2) the propensity to choose the risky option was related to increased
      reward-related activation in VS and medial PFC, and (3) longitudinal comparisons 
      indicated that self-reported reward sensitivity was specifically related to VS
      activation over time. Together, these results advance our insights in the brain
      circuitry underlying reward processing across adolescence.

TI  - I love my grandkid! An NIRS study of grandmaternal love in Japan.
PG  - 131-7
AB  - Grandmaternal love is essential for the grandmother-grandchild attachment
      relationship and thus aids an infant's development and mental health, but the
      underlying neural mechanism is unknown. Recent studies have shed light on
      involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in maternal and romantic love. Here,
      we investigated the involvement of the PFC in grandmaternal love by examining
      cerebral hemoglobin concentration changes using near-infrared spectroscopy
      (NIRS). Seventeen grandmothers viewed video clips which included their own or
      other's (unknown) grandchild smiling or showing a neutral expression while the
      oxy-hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration was measured from the anterior prefrontal
      cortex (APFC). The sight of one's own grandchild activated the inferior and
      medial APFC irrespective of their expression. In addition, the sight of the
      smiling grandchild induced an increased activation in the medial APFC involved in
      reward monitoring and mentalizing and an additional activation in the superior
      APFC involved in cognitive and attentional control. Both medial and superior
      activations significantly correlated with emotional mood rating. These findings
      indicate that the different regions of the APFC are involved in grandmaternal
      love.

TI  - Contrasting prefrontal cortex contributions to episodic memory dysfunction in
      behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - e87778
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0087778 [doi]
AB  - Recent evidence has questioned the integrity of episodic memory in behavioural
      variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), where recall performance is impaired to 
      the same extent as in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While these deficits appear to be
      mediated by divergent patterns of brain atrophy, there is evidence to suggest
      that certain prefrontal regions are implicated across both patient groups. In
      this study we sought to further elucidate the dorsolateral (DLPFC) and
      ventromedial (VMPFC) prefrontal contributions to episodic memory impairment in
      bvFTD and AD. Performance on episodic memory tasks and neuropsychological
      measures typically tapping into either DLPFC or VMPFC functions was assessed in
      22 bvFTD, 32 AD patients and 35 age- and education-matched controls.
      Behaviourally, patient groups did not differ on measures of episodic memory
      recall or DLPFC-mediated executive functions. BvFTD patients were significantly
      more impaired on measures of VMPFC-mediated executive functions. Composite
      measures of the recall, DLPFC and VMPFC task scores were covaried against the T1 
      MRI scans of all participants to identify regions of atrophy correlating with
      performance on these tasks. Imaging analysis showed that impaired recall
      performance is associated with divergent patterns of PFC atrophy in bvFTD and AD.
      Whereas in bvFTD, PFC atrophy covariates for recall encompassed both DLPFC and
      VMPFC regions, only the DLPFC was implicated in AD. Our results suggest that
      episodic memory deficits in bvFTD and AD are underpinned by divergent prefrontal 
      mechanisms. Moreover, we argue that these differences are not adequately captured
      by existing neuropsychological measures.

TI  - The neural bases of uninstructed negative emotion modulation.

AB  - Although numerous neuroimaging studies have examined what happens when
      individuals are instructed to regulate their emotions, we rarely receive such
      instruction in everyday life. This study sought to examine what underlies
      uninstructed modulation of negative affect by examining neural responses when
      'responding naturally' to negative stimuli-and for comparison-during instructed
      reappraisal of negative stimuli as well. Two analyses were conducted to identify 
      how variability in negative affect related to neural responses when responding
      naturally. First, in a within-participant analysis, lower levels of self-reported
      negative affect on a given trial were associated with recruitment of dorsolateral
      and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC)-brain regions also active during
      instructed reappraisal-whereas higher levels of negative affect were associated
      with recruitment of the amygdala-a region that responded more strongly overall to
      negative than neutral stimuli. Second, in a between-participant analysis, lower
      levels of average self-reported negative affect were associated with recruitment 
      of ventromedial PFC. These results suggest that uninstructed modulation of
      emotion involves a combination of two types of regulatory processes, with
      moment-to-moment modulation depending on prefrontal regions that support
      reappraisal and individual differences in modulation depending on ventromedial
      PFC, a region involved in fear extinction.

TI  - Hypoactive medial prefrontal cortex functioning in adults reporting childhood
      emotional maltreatment.
PG  - 2026-33
LID - 10.1093/scan/nsu008 [doi]
AB  - Childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM) has adverse effects on medial prefrontal
      cortex (mPFC) morphology, a structure that is crucial for cognitive functioning
      and (emotional) memory and which modulates the limbic system. In addition, CEM
      has been linked to amygdala hyperactivity during emotional face processing.
      However, no study has yet investigated the functional neural correlates of
      neutral and emotional memory in adults reporting CEM. Using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging, we investigated CEM-related differential activations in mPFC
      during the encoding and recognition of positive, negative and neutral words. The 
      sample (N = 194) consisted of patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders
      and healthy controls (HC) reporting CEM (n = 96) and patients and HC reporting no
      abuse (n = 98). We found a consistent pattern of mPFC hypoactivation during
      encoding and recognition of positive, negative and neutral words in individuals
      reporting CEM. These results were not explained by psychopathology or severity of
      depression or anxiety symptoms, or by gender, level of neuroticism, parental
      psychopathology, negative life events, antidepressant use or decreased mPFC
      volume in the CEM group. These findings indicate mPFC hypoactivity in individuals
      reporting CEM during emotional and neutral memory encoding and recognition. Our
      findings suggest that CEM may increase individuals' risk to the development of
      psychopathology on differential levels of processing in the brain; blunted mPFC
      activation during higher order processing and enhanced amygdala activation during
      automatic/lower order emotion processing. These findings are vital in
      understanding the long-term consequences of CEM.

TI  - Subanesthetic ketamine treatment promotes abnormal interactions between neural
      subsystems and alters the properties of functional brain networks.
PG  - 1786-98
LID - 10.1038/npp.2014.26 [doi]
AB  - Acute treatment with subanesthetic ketamine, a non-competitive
      N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is widely utilized as a
      translational model for schizophrenia. However, how acute NMDA receptor blockade 
      impacts on brain functioning at a systems level, to elicit translationally
      relevant symptomatology and behavioral deficits, has not yet been determined.
      Here, for the first time, we apply established and recently validated topological
      measures from network science to brain imaging data gained from ketamine-treated 
      mice to elucidate how acute NMDA receptor blockade impacts on the properties of
      functional brain networks. We show that the effects of acute ketamine treatment
      on the global properties of these networks are divergent from those widely
      reported in schizophrenia. Where acute NMDA receptor blockade promotes
      hyperconnectivity in functional brain networks, pronounced dysconnectivity is
      found in schizophrenia. We also show that acute ketamine treatment increases the 
      connectivity and importance of prefrontal and thalamic brain regions in brain
      networks, a finding also divergent to alterations seen in schizophrenia. In
      addition, we characterize how ketamine impacts on bipartite functional
      interactions between neural subsystems. A key feature includes the enhancement of
      prefrontal cortex (PFC)-neuromodulatory subsystem connectivity in
      ketamine-treated animals, a finding consistent with the known effects of ketamine
      on PFC neurotransmitter levels. Overall, our data suggest that, at a systems
      level, acute ketamine-induced alterations in brain network connectivity do not
      parallel those seen in chronic schizophrenia. Hence, the mechanisms through which
      acute ketamine treatment induces translationally relevant symptomatology may
      differ from those in chronic schizophrenia. Future effort should therefore be
      dedicated to resolve the conflicting observations between this putative
      translational model and schizophrenia.

AB  - The ability to predict an impending threat during Pavlovian conditioning
      diminishes the emotional response that is produced once the threat is
      encountered. Diminution of the threat response appears to be mediated by somewhat
      independent associative learning and expectancy-related processes. Therefore, the
      present study was designed to better understand the neural mechanisms that
      support associative learning processes, independent of expectancy, that influence
      the emotional response to a threat. Healthy volunteers took part in a Pavlovian
      conditioning procedure during which trait anxiety, expectation of the
      unconditioned stimulus (UCS), skin conductance response (SCR), and functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal were assessed. The results showed no
      evidence for associative learning that was independent of expectation.
      Threat-related SCR expression was diminished on predictable trials vs.
      unpredictable trials of the UCS (i.e. conditioned UCR diminution). Similar to
      SCR, conditioned UCR diminution was observed within the left dorsolateral PFC,
      dorsomedial PFC, ventromedial PFC, and left anterior insula. In contrast,
      potentiation of the threat-related fMRI signal response was observed within left 
      dorsolateral PFC, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and posterior insula. A
      negative relationship was observed between UCS expectancy and UCR expression
      within the dorsomedial PFC, ventromedial PFC, and anterior insula. Finally, the
      anticipatory fMRI signal responses within the PFC, posterior cingulate, and
      amygdala showed an inverse relationship with threat-related activation within the
      brain regions that showed UCR diminution. The current findings suggest that the
      PFC and amygdala support learning-related processes that impact the magnitude of 
      the emotional response to a threat.

AB  - When interacting with technical systems, users experience mental workload.
      Particularly in multitasking scenarios (e.g., interacting with the car navigation
      system while driving) it is desired to not distract the users from their primary 
      task. For such purposes, human-machine interfaces (HCIs) are desirable which
      continuously monitor the users' workload and dynamically adapt the behavior of
      the interface to the measured workload. While memory tasks have been shown to
      elicit hemodynamic responses in the brain when averaging over multiple trials, a 
      robust single trial classification is a crucial prerequisite for the purpose of
      dynamically adapting HCIs to the workload of its user. The prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) plays an important role in the processing of memory and the associated
      workload. In this study of 10 subjects, we used functional Near-Infrared
      Spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive imaging modality, to sample workload
      activity in the PFC. The results show up to 78% accuracy for single-trial
      discrimination of three levels of workload from each other. We use an n-back task
      (n in {1, 2, 3}) to induce different levels of workload, forcing subjects to
      continuously remember the last one, two, or three of rapidly changing items. Our 
      experimental results show that measuring hemodynamic responses in the PFC with
      fNIRS, can be used to robustly quantify and classify mental workload. Single
      trial analysis is still a young field that suffers from a general lack of
      standards. To increase comparability of fNIRS methods and results, the data
      corpus for this study is made available online.

PG  - 568617
LID - 10.1155/2013/568617 [doi]
AB  - Objectives. Patients affected by bipolar disorder (BP) and major depressive
      disorder (UP) share the susceptibility to experience depression and differ in
      their susceptibility to mania, but clinical studies suggest that the biological
      substrates of the two disorders could influence the apparently similar depressive
      phases. The few brain imaging studies available described different brain
      metabolic and neural correlates of UP and BP. Methods. We studied the BOLD neural
      response to a moral valence decision task targeting the depressive biases in
      information processing in 36 subjects (14 BP, 11 UP, and 11 controls). Results.
      Main differences between UP and controls and between UP and BP were detected in
      left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC, BA 47). Neural responses of BP
      patients differed from those of control subjects in multiple brain areas,
      including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial PFC, bilateral dorsolateral 
      PFC, temporal cortex and insula, and parietal and occipital cortex. Conclusions. 
      Our results are in agreement with hypotheses of dysfunctions in corticolimbic
      circuitries regulating affects and emotions in mood disorders and suggest that
      specific abnormalities, particularly in ventrolateral PFC, are not the same in UP
      and BP depression.

PG  - 1051-6
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3496-13.2014 [doi]
AB  - The neuregulin 3 gene (NRG3) plays pleiotropic roles in neurodevelopment and is a
      putative susceptibility locus for schizophrenia. Specifically, the T allele of
      NRG3 rs10748842 has been associated with illness risk, altered cognitive
      function, and the expression of a novel splice isoform in prefrontal cortex
      (PFC), but the neural system effects are unexplored. Here, we report an
      association between rs10748842 and PFC physiology as measured by functional
      magnetic resonance imaging of human working memory performance, where a
      convincing link between increased genetic risk for schizophrenia and increased
      activation in some PFC areas has been established. In 410 control individuals
      (195 males, 215 females), we detected a highly significant effect of NRG3
      genotype manifesting as an unanticipated increase in ventrolateral PFC activation
      in nonrisk-associated C allele carriers. An additional analysis including 78
      patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (64 males, 14 females) and 123
      unaffected siblings (53 males, 70 females) revealed a whole-brain significant
      genotype by group interaction in right dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), manifesting as a
      relative activation increase in healthy controls and siblings (C > T/T) and as a 
      hypoactivation in patients (T/T > C). These observed genotype-dependent effects
      in PFC were not explained by task performance and did not conform to established 
      locales of prefrontal inefficiency linked to genetic risk for schizophrenia. Our 
      data indicate a complex modulation of brain physiology by rs10748842, which does 
      not fit the simple inefficiency model of risk association in DLPFC and suggests
      that other neurobiological mechanisms are involved.

AB  - Encoding, storage and retrieval constitute three fundamental stages in
      information processing and memory. They allow for the creation of new memory
      traces, the maintenance and the consolidation of these traces over time, and the 
      access and recover of the stored information from short or long-term memory.
      Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive neuroimaging
      technique that measures concentration changes of oxygenated-hemoglobin (O2Hb) and
      deoxygenated-hemoglobin (HHb) in cortical microcirculation blood vessels by means
      of the characteristic absorption spectra of hemoglobin in the near-infrared
      range. In the present study, we monitored, using a 16-channel fNIRS system, the
      hemodynamic response during the encoding and retrieval processes (EP and RP,
      respectively) over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 13 healthy subjects (27.2 +/-
      2.6 years) while were performing the "Logical Memory Test" (LMT) of the Wechsler 
      Memory Scale. A LMT-related PFC activation was expected; specifically, it was
      hypothesized a neural dissociation between EP and RP. The results showed a
      heterogeneous O2Hb/HHb response over the mapped area during the EP and the RP,
      with a O2Hb progressive and prominent increment in ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC)
      since the beginning of the EP. During the RP a broader activation, including the 
      VLPFC, the dorsolateral PFC and the frontopolar cortex, was observed. This could 
      be explained by the different contributions of the PFC regions in the EP and the 
      RP. Considering the fNIRS applicability for the hemodynamic monitoring during the
      LMT performance, this study has demonstrated that fNIRS could be utilized as a
      valuable clinical diagnostic tool, and that it has the potential to be adopted in
      patients with cognitive disorders or slight working memory deficits.

AB  - In humans, exposure to stress during development is associated with structural
      and functional alterations of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY), and
      hippocampus (HC) and their circuits of connectivity, and with an increased risk
      for developing major depressive disorder particularly in carriers of the short
      (s) variant of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene-linked polymorphic region
      (5-HTTLPR). Although changes in these regions are found in carriers of the s
      allele and/or in depressed patients, evidence for a specific genotype x
      developmental stress effect on brain structure and function is limited. Here, we 
      investigated the effect of repeated stress exposure during adolescence in mice
      with partial knockout of the 5-HTT gene (HET) vs. wildtype (WT) on
      early-adulthood behavioral measures and brain structure [using magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI)] relevant to human major depression. Behaviorally, adolescent
      stress (AS) increased anxiety and decreased activity and did so to a similar
      degree in HET and WT. In a probabilistic reversal learning task, HET-AS mice
      achieved fewer reversals than did HET-No-AS mice. 5-HTT genotype and AS were
      without effect on corticosterone stress response. In terms of structural brain
      differences, AS reduced the volume of two long-range white matter tracts, the
      optic tract (OT) and the cerebral peduncle (CP), in WT mice specifically. In a
      region-of-interest analysis, AS was associated with increased HC volume and HET
      genotype with a decreased frontal lobe volume. In conclusion, we found that 5-HTT
      and AS genotype exerted long-term effects on behavior and development of brain
      regions relevant to human depression.

TI  - Cerebral hemodynamic and oxygenation changes induced by inner and heard speech: a
      study combining functional near-infrared spectroscopy and capnography.
PG  - 17002
LID - 10.1117/1.JBO.19.1.017002 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of inner and heard speech on
      cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation in the anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      using functional near-infrared spectroscopy and to test whether potential effects
      were caused by alterations in the arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2).
      Twenty-nine healthy adult volunteers performed six different tasks of inner and
      heard speech according to a randomized crossover design. During the tasks, we
      generally found a decrease in PaCO2 (only for inner speech), tissue oxygen
      saturation (StO2), oxyhemoglobin ([O2Hb]), total hemoglobin ([tHb]) concentration
      and an increase in deoxyhemoglobin concentration ([HHb]). Furthermore, we found
      significant relations between changes in [O2Hb], [HHb], [tHb], or StO2 and the
      participants' age, the baseline PETCO2, or certain speech tasks. We conclude that
      changes in breathing during the tasks led to lower PaCO2 (hypocapnia) for inner
      speech. During heard speech, no significant changes in PaCO2 occurred, but the
      decreases in StO2, [O2Hb], and [tHb] suggest that changes in PaCO2 were also
      involved here. Different verse types (hexameter and alliteration) led to
      different changes in [tHb], implying different brain activations. In conclusion, 
      StO2, [O2Hb], [HHb], and [tHb] are affected by interplay of both PaCO2 reactivity
      and functional brain activity.

TI  - Differential contributions of infralimbic prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens
      during reward-based learning and extinction.

LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2346-13.2014 [doi]
AB  - Using environmental cues for the prediction of future events is essential for
      survival. Such cue-outcome associations are thought to depend on mesolimbic
      circuitry involving the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC).
      Several studies have identified roles for both NAc and PFC in the expression of
      stable goal-directed behaviors, but much remains unknown about their roles during
      learning of such behaviors. To further address this question, we used in vivo
      oxygen amperometry, a proxy for blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal
      measurement in human functional magnetic resonance imaging, in rats performing a 
      cued lever-pressing task requiring discrimination between a rewarded and
      nonrewarded cue. Simultaneous oxygen recordings were obtained from infralimbic
      PFC (IFC) and NAc throughout both acquisition and extinction of this task.
      Activation of NAc was specifically observed following rewarded cue onset during
      the entire acquisition phase and also during the first days of extinction. In
      contrast, IFC activated only during the earliest periods of acquisition and
      extinction, more specifically to the nonrewarded cue. Thus, in vivo oxygen
      amperometry permits a novel, stable form of longitudinal analysis of brain
      activity in behaving animals, allowing dissociation of the roles of different
      brain regions over time during learning of reward-driven instrumental action. The
      present results offer a unique temporal perspective on how NAc may promote
      actions directed toward anticipated positive outcome throughout learning, while
      IFC might suppress actions that no longer result in reward, but only during
      critical periods of learning.

AB  - Conflict adaptation has been widely researched in normal and clinical
      populations. There are large individual differences in conflict adaptation, and
      it has been linked to the schizotypal trait. However, no study to date has
      examined how individual differences in spontaneous brain activity are related to 
      behavioral conflict adaptation (performance). Resting-state functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) is a promising tool to investigate this issue. The
      present study evaluated the regional homogeneity (ReHo) of RS-fMRI signals in
      order to explore the neural basis of individual differences in conflict
      adaptation across two independent samples comprising a total of 67 normal
      subjects. A partial correlation analysis was carried out to examine the
      relationship between ReHo and behavioral conflict adaptation, while controlling
      for reaction time, standard deviation and flanker interference effects. This
      analysis was conducted on 39 subjects' data (sample 1); the results showed
      significant positive correlations in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. We then conducted a
      test-validation procedure on the remaining 28 subjects' data (sample 2) to
      examine the reliability of the results. Regions of interest were defined based on
      the correlation results. Regression analysis showed that variability in ReHo
      values in the DLPFC accounted for 48% of the individual differences in the
      conflict adaptation effect in sample 2. The present findings provide further
      support for the importance of the DLPFC in the conflict adaptation process. More 
      importantly, we demonstrated that ReHo of RS-fMRI signals in the DLPFC can
      predict behavioral performance in conflict adaptation, which provides potential
      biomarkers for the early detection of cognitive control deterioration.

LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00561 [doi]
AB  - Behavioral inhibition and performance monitoring are critical cognitive functions
      supported by distributed neural networks including the pFC. We examined
      neurophysiological correlates of motor response inhibition and action monitoring 
      in patients with focal orbitofrontal (OFC) lesions (n = 12) after resection of a 
      primary intracranial tumor or contusion because of traumatic brain injury.
      Healthy participants served as controls (n = 14). Participants performed a visual
      stop signal task. We analyzed behavioral performance as well as event-related
      brain potentials and oscillations. Inhibition difficulty was adjusted
      individually to yield an equal amount of successful inhibitions across
      participants. RTs of patients and controls did not differ significantly in go
      trials or in failed stop trials, and no differences were observed in estimated
      stop signal RT. However, electrophysiological response patterns during task
      performance distinguished the groups. Patients with OFC lesions had enhanced P3
      amplitudes to congruent condition go signals and to stop signals. In stop trials,
      patients had attenuated N2 and error-related negativity, but enhanced error
      positivity. Patients also showed enhanced and prolonged post-error beta band
      increases for stop errors. This effect was particularly evident in patients whose
      lesion extended to the subgenual cingulate cortex. In summary, although response 
      inhibition was not impaired, the diminished stop N2 and ERN support a critical
      role of the OFC in action monitoring. Moreover, the increased stop P3, error
      positivity, and post-error beta response indicate that OFC injury affected action
      outcome evaluation and support the notion that the OFC is relevant for the
      processing of abstract reinforcers such as performing correctly in the task.

TI  - Neural substrates of social status inference: roles of medial prefrontal cortex
      and superior temporal sulcus.
PG  - 1131-40
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00553 [doi]
AB  - The negotiation of social order is intimately connected to the capacity to infer 
      and track status relationships. Despite the foundational role of status in social
      cognition, we know little about how the brain constructs status from social
      interactions that display it. Although emerging cognitive neuroscience reveals
      that status judgments depend on the intraparietal sulcus, a brain region that
      supports the comparison of targets along a quantitative continuum, we present
      evidence that status judgments do not necessarily reduce to ranking targets along
      a quantitative continuum. The process of judging status also fits a social
      interdependence analysis. Consistent with third-party perceivers judging status
      by inferring whose goals are dictating the terms of the interaction and who is
      subordinating their desires to whom, status judgments were associated with
      increased recruitment of medial pFC and STS, brain regions implicated in mental
      state inference.

AB  - Craving of unhealthy food is a common target of self-regulation, but the neural
      systems underlying this process are understudied. In this study, participants
      used cognitive reappraisal to regulate their desire to consume idiosyncratically 
      craved or not craved energy-dense foods, and neural activity during regulation
      was compared with each other and with the activity during passive viewing of
      energy-dense foods. Regulation of both food types elicited activation in classic 
      top-down self-regulation regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal, inferior 
      frontal, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices. This main effect of regulation
      was qualified by an interaction, such that activation in these regions was
      significantly greater during reappraisal of craved (versus not craved) foods and 
      several regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal, inferior frontal, medial 
      frontal, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices, were uniquely active during
      regulation of personally craved foods. Body mass index significantly negatively
      correlated with regulation-related activation in the right dorsolateral PFC,
      thalamus, and bilateral dorsal ACC and with activity in nucleus accumbens during 
      passive viewing of craved (vs. neutral, low-energy density) foods. These results 
      suggest that several of the brain regions involved in the self-regulation of food
      craving are similar to other kinds of affective self-regulation and that others
      are sensitive to the self-relevance of the regulation target.

AB  - Behavioral studies indicate that theory of mind and counterfactual reasoning are 
      strongly related cognitive processes. In a neuroimaging study, we explored the
      common and distinct regions underlying these inference processes. We directly
      compared false belief reasoning (inferring an agent's false belief about an
      object's location or content) and counterfactual reasoning (inferring what the
      object's location or content would be if an agent had acted differently), both in
      contrast with a baseline condition of conditional reasoning (inferring what the
      true location or content of an object is). Results indicate that these three
      types of reasoning about social scenarios are supported by activations in the
      mentalizing network (left temporo-parietal junction and precuneus) and the
      executive control network (bilateral prefrontal cortex [PFC] and right inferior
      parietal lobule). In addition, representing a false belief or counterfactual
      state (both not directly observable in the external world) recruits additional
      activity in the executive control network (left dorsolateral PFC and parietal
      lobe). The results further suggest that counterfactual reasoning is a more
      complex cognitive process than false belief reasoning, showing stronger
      activation of the dorsomedial, left dorsolateral PFC, cerebellum and left
      temporal cortex.

AB  - Stress is a constant characteristic of everyday life in our society, playing a
      role in triggering several chronic disorders. Therefore, there is an ongoing need
      to develop new methods in order to manage stress reactions. The regulatory
      function of right medial-prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is frequently reported by
      imaging studies during psychosocial stress situations. Here, we examined the
      effects of inhibitory and excitatory preconditioning stimulation via cathodal and
      anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on psychosocial stress
      related behavioral indicators and physiological factors, including the cortisol
      level in the saliva and changes in brain perfusion. Twenty minutes real or sham
      tDCS was applied over the right mPFC of healthy subjects before the performance
      of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was
      measured during stimulation and after TSST, using pseudo-continuous arterial spin
      labeling (pCASL). Comparing the effect of the different stimulation conditions,
      during anodal stimulation we found higher rCBF in the right mPFC, compared to the
      sham and in the right amygdala, superior PFC compared to the cathodal condition. 
      Salivary cortisol levels showed a decrease in the anodal and increase in cathodal
      groups after completion of the TSST. The behavioral stress indicators indicated
      the increase of stress level, however, did not show any significant differences
      among groups. In this study we provide the first insights into the neuronal
      mechanisms mediating psychosocial stress responses by prefrontal tDCS.

TI  - Alterations of attention and emotional processing following childhood-onset
      damage to the prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1037/a0035415 [doi]
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC), especially the medial sector, plays a crucial role
      in emotional processing. Damage to this region results in impaired processing of 
      emotional information, perhaps attributable to an inability to initiate and
      maintain attention toward emotional materials, a process that is normally
      automatic. Childhood onset damage to the PFC impairs emotional processing more
      than adult-onset PFC damage. The aim of this work was to study the involvement of
      the PFC in attention to emotional stimuli, and to explore how age at lesion onset
      affects this involvement. To address these issues, we studied both the emotional 
      and attentional modulation of the startle reflex. Our sample was composed of 4
      patients with childhood-onset PFC damage, 6 patients with adult-onset PFC damage,
      and 10 healthy comparison participants. Subjects viewed 54 affective pictures;
      acoustic startle probes were presented at 300 ms after picture onset in 18
      pictures (as an index of attentional modulation) and at 3,800 ms after picture
      onset in 18 pictures (as an index of emotional modulation). Childhood-onset PFC
      patients did not show attentional or emotional modulation of the response, in
      contrast to adult-onset PFC damage and comparison participants. Early onset
      damage to the PFC results, therefore, in more severe dysfunction in the
      processing of affective stimuli than adult-onset PFC damage, perhaps reflecting
      limited plasticity in the neural systems that support these processes.

      Bipolar Disorder.
PG  - 416-31
LID - 10.3390/jcm3020416 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that bipolar disorder (BD) and conduct
      disorder (CD) are co-occurring disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging has revealed
      differences in the structure and function of the frontal cortex in these
      disorders when studied separately; however, the impact of BD comorbidity on brain
      structure in adolescents with CD has not yet been examined. METHOD: We conducted 
      an optimized voxel based morphometry (VBM) study of juvenile offenders with the
      following diagnoses: conduct disorder with comorbid bipolar disorder (CD-BD; n = 
      24), conduct disorder without bipolar disorder (CD; n = 24) and healthy controls 
      (HC, n = 24). Participants were 13-17 years of age, in a residential treatment
      facility for repeat offenders. The three groups in this study were similar in
      age, gender, socioeconomic status and ethnicity. RESULTS: We found CD-BD subjects
      had decreased volume relative to controls at the voxel level in the right medial 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). Using a Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE)
      technique, the CD-BD subjects had significantly decreased volumes of the right
      medial prefrontal cortex and portions of the superior and inferior frontal gyrus,
      anterior cingulate and temporal gyrus. The CD subjects did not have differences
      in brain volume compared to control subjects or CD-BD subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings suggest the comorbidity between CD and BD is associated with
      neurobiological impact namely volumetric differences from healthy controls.
      Furthermore subjects with this comorbidity had poorer lifetime functioning, more 
      mood and attentional dysfunction, and more medication exposure than subjects with
      CD who were not BD.

AB  - Recent neuroimaging studies state that meditation increases regional cerebral
      blood flow (rCBF) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The present study employed
      functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to evaluate the relative
      hemodynamic changes in PFC during a cognitive task. Twenty-two healthy male
      volunteers with ages between 18 and 30 years (group mean age +/- SD; 22.9 +/- 4.6
      years) performed a color-word stroop task before and after 20 min of meditation
      and random thinking. Repeated measures ANOVA was performed followed by a post hoc
      analysis with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons between the mean
      values of "During" and "Post" with "Pre" state. During meditation there was an
      increased in oxy-hemoglobin (DeltaHbO) and total hemoglobin (DeltaTHC)
      concentration with reduced deoxy-hemoglobin (DeltaHbR) concentration over the
      right prefrontal cortex (rPFC), whereas in random thinking there was increased
      DeltaHbR with reduced total hemoglobin concentration on the rPFC. The mean
      reaction time (RT) was shorter during stroop color word task with concomitant
      reduction in DeltaTHC after meditation, suggestive of improved performance and
      efficiency in task related to attention. Our findings demonstrated that
      meditation increased cerebral oxygenation and enhanced performance, which was
      associated with activation of the PFC.

AB  - A major difference between humans and other animals is our capacity to maintain
      information in working memory (WM) while performing secondary tasks, which
      enables sustained, complex cognition. A common assumption is that the lateral
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for WM performance in the presence of
      distracters, but direct evidence is scarce. We assessed the relationship between 
      fMRI activity and WM performance within subjects, with performance matched across
      distracter and no-distracter conditions. Activity in the ventrolateral PFC during
      WM encoding and maintenance positively predicted performance in both conditions, 
      whereas activity in the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) predicted
      performance only under distraction. Other parts of the dorsolateral and
      ventrolateral PFCs predicted performance only in the no-distracter condition.
      These findings challenge a lateral-PFC-centered view of distracter resistance,
      and suggest that the lateral PFC supports a type of WM representation that is
      efficient for dealing with task-irrelevant input but is, nonetheless, easily
      disrupted by dual-task demands.

AB  - Multitasking (MT) constitutes engaging in two or more cognitive activities at the
      same time. MT-training improves performance on untrained MT tasks and alters the 
      functional activity of the brain during MT. However, the effects of MT-training
      on neural mechanisms beyond MT-related functions are not known. We investigated
      the effects of 4 weeks of MT-training on regional gray matter volume (rGMV) and
      functional connectivity during rest (resting-FC) in young human adults.
      MT-training was associated with increased rGMV in three prefrontal cortical
      regions (left lateral rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), 
      and left inferior frontal junction), the left posterior parietal cortex, and the 
      left temporal and lateral occipital areas as well as decreased resting-FC between
      the right DLPFC and an anatomical cluster around the ventral anterior cingulate
      cortex (ACC). Our findings suggest that participation in MT-training is as a
      whole associated with task-irrelevant plasticity (i.e., neural changes are not
      limited to certain specific task conditions) in regions and the network that are 
      assumed to play roles in MT as well as diverse higher-order cognitive functions. 
      We could not dissociate the effects of each task component and the diverse
      cognitive processes involved in MT because of the nature of the study, and these 
      remain to be investigated.

AB  - While positive behavioral information is diagnostic when evaluating a person's
      abilities, negative information is diagnostic when evaluating morality. Although 
      social psychology has considered these two domains as orthogonal and distinct
      from one another, we demonstrate that this asymmetry in diagnosticity can be
      explained by a single parsimonious principle--the perceived frequency of
      behaviors in these domains. Less frequent behaviors (e.g., high ability and low
      morality) are weighed more heavily in evaluations. We show that this statistical 
      principle of frequency-derived diagnosticity is evident in human participants at 
      both behavioral and neural levels of analysis. Specifically, activity in right
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex increased preferentially when participants
      updated impressions based on diagnostic behaviors, and further, activity in this 
      region covaried parametrically with the perceived frequency of behaviors.
      Activity in left ventrolateral PFC, left inferior frontal gyrus, and left
      superior temporal sulcus showed similar patterns of diagnosticity and
      sensitivity, though additional analyses confirmed that these regions responded
      primarily to updates based on immoral behaviors.

AB  - Previous neuroimaging research has established that the left ventrolateral
      prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) is involved in long-term memory (LTM) encoding for
      individual items. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is implicated less
      frequently, and one theory that has gained support to explain this discrepancy is
      that DLPFC is involved in forming item-item relational but not item LTM. Given
      that neuroimaging results are correlational, complimentary methods such as
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been used to test causal 
      hypotheses generated from imaging data. Most TMS studies of LTM encoding have
      found that disruption of lateral PFC activity impairs subsequent memory. However 
      these studies have lacked methods to precisely localize and directly compare TMS 
      effects from frontal subregions implicated by the neuroimaging literature. Here, 
      we target specific subregions of lateral PFC with TMS to test the prediction from
      the item/relational framework that temporary disruption of VLPFC during encoding 
      will impair subsequent memory whereas TMS to DLPFC during item encoding will not.
      Frontal TMS was administered prior to a LTM encoding task in which participants
      were presented with a list of individual nouns and asked to judge whether each
      noun was concrete or abstract. After a 40 min delay period, item recognition
      memory was tested. Results indicate that VLPFC and DLPFC TMS have differential
      effects on subsequent item memory. VLPFC TMS reliably disrupted subsequent item
      memory whereas DLPFC TMS led to numerical enhancement in item memory, relative to
      TMS to a control region.

AB  - We investigated the role of distinct regions of the default-mode network (DMN)
      during memory encoding with fMRI. Subjects encoded words using either a strategy 
      that emphasized self-referential (pleasantness) processing, or one that
      emphasized semantic (man-made/natural) processing. During encoding subjects were 
      intermittently presented with thought probes to evaluate if they were
      concentrated and on-task or exhibiting task-unrelated thoughts (TUT). After the
      scanning session subjects performed a source retrieval task to determine which of
      two judgments they performed for each word at encoding. Source retrieval accuracy
      was higher for words encoded with the pleasantness vs. the man-made/natural task 
      and there was a trend for higher performance for words preceding on-task vs. TUT 
      reports. fMRI results show that left anterior medial PFC and left angular gyrus
      activity was greater during successful vs. unsuccessful encoding during both
      encoding tasks. Greater activity in left anterior cingulate and bilateral lateral
      temporal cortex was related successful vs. unsuccessful encoding only in the
      pleasantness task. In contrast, posterior cingulate, right anterior cingulate and
      right temporoparietal junction were activated to a greater extent in unsuccessful
      vs. successful encoding across tasks. Finally, activation in posterior cingulate 
      and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was related to TUT across tasks;
      moreover, we observed a conjunction in posterior cingulate between encoding
      failure and TUT. We conclude that DMN regions play dissociable roles during
      memory formation, and that their association with subsequent memory may depend on
      the manner in which information is encoded and retrieved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The experience of early stress contributes to the etiology of several
      psychiatric disorders and can lead to lasting deficits in working memory and
      attention. These executive functions require activation of the prefrontal cortex 
      (PFC) by muscarinic M1 acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. Such Galphaq-protein
      coupled receptors trigger the release of calcium (Ca(2+)) from internal stores
      and elicit prolonged neuronal excitation. METHODS: In brain slices of rat PFC, we
      employed multiphoton imaging simultaneously with whole-cell electrophysiological 
      recordings to examine potential interactions between ACh-induced Ca(2+) release
      and excitatory currents in adulthood, across postnatal development, and following
      the early stress of repeated maternal separation, a rodent model for depression. 
      We also investigated developmental changes in related genes in these groups.
      RESULTS: Acetylcholine-induced Ca(2+) release potentiates ACh-elicited excitatory
      currents. In the healthy PFC, this potentiation of muscarinic excitation emerges 
      in young adulthood, when executive function typically reaches maturity. However, 
      the developmental consolidation of muscarinic ACh signaling is abolished in
      adults with a history of early stress, where ACh responses retain an adolescent
      phenotype. In prefrontal cortex, these rats show a disruption in the expression
      of multiple developmentally regulated genes associated with Galphaq and Ca(2+)
      signaling. Pharmacologic and ionic manipulations reveal that the enhancement of
      muscarinic excitation in the healthy adult PFC arises via the electrogenic
      process of sodium/Ca(2+) exchange. CONCLUSIONS: This work illustrates a
      long-lasting disruption in ACh-mediated cortical excitation following early
      stress and raises the possibility that such cellular mechanisms may disrupt the
      maturation of executive function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with regional
      hyperactivity in cortico-striatal circuits. However, the large-scale patterns of 
      abnormal neural connectivity remain uncharacterized. Resting-state functional
      connectivity studies have shown altered connectivity within the implicated
      circuitry, but they have used seed-driven approaches wherein a circuit of
      interest is defined a priori. This limits their ability to identify network
      abnormalities beyond the prevailing framework. This limitation is particularly
      problematic within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is large and heterogeneous 
      and where a priori specification of seeds is therefore difficult. A
      hypothesis-neutral, data-driven approach to the analysis of connectivity is
      vital. METHODS: We analyzed resting-state functional connectivity data collected 
      at 3T in 27 OCD patients and 66 matched control subjects with a recently
      developed data-driven global brain connectivity (GBC) method, both within the PFC
      and across the whole brain. RESULTS: We found clusters of decreased connectivity 
      in the left lateral PFC in both whole-brain and PFC-restricted analyses.
      Increased GBC was found in the right putamen and left cerebellar cortex. Within
      regions of interest in the basal ganglia and thalamus, we identified increased
      GBC in dorsal striatum and anterior thalamus, which was reduced in patients on
      medication. The ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens exhibited decreased global
      connectivity but increased connectivity specifically with the ventral anterior
      cingulate cortex in subjects with OCD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify
      previously uncharacterized PFC and basal ganglia dysconnectivity in OCD and
      reveal differentially altered GBC in dorsal and ventral striatum. Results
      highlight complex disturbances in PFC networks, which could contribute to
      disrupted cortical-striatal-cerebellar circuits in OCD.

AB  - A gene-environment (GxE) interaction is implicated in both the pathophysiology
      and treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). This study modeled the effects 
      of genetic vulnerability by using the Flinders sensitive line (FSL), a rat model 
      of depression and its control counterpart-the Flinders resistant line (FRL). The 
      effects of environmental vulnerability (e.g., early-life stress) were modeled by 
      using maternal separation. Rats (n=105) were drawn from four groups reflecting
      experimental crossing of strain (FSL vs. FRL) and early-life stress (high vs.
      low) to assess the effects of two antidepressants (escitalopram or nortriptyline)
      compared to vehicle. Quantitative in vitro autoradiography was performed using
      [(125)I]MPPI (5-HT1A) and [(125)I]CYP (5-HT1B) in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
      hippocampus. Stringent, Bonferroni-corrected statistical analyses showed
      significant strain-by-rearing-by-treatment (three-way) interactions in PFC 5-HT1A
      and hippocampal 5-HT1B receptors. Either vulnerability reduced serotonergic
      binding; no additive effects were associated with the two vulnerabilities. Both
      antidepressants increased hippocampal 5-HT1B receptor binding; however, only
      nortriptyline selectively increased PFC 5-HT1A receptor binding. Taken together, 
      our findings demonstrate that antidepressant effects on the serotonergic system
      are shaped by a GxE interaction that depends on antidepressant class and brain
      region.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the association between clinical symptoms and
      anatomical and functional cerebral deficits in codeine-containing cough syrups
      (CCS) users using voxel-based morphometry and resting state functional
      connectivity analysis. METHODS: Participants were 30 CCS users and 30 matched
      controls. Both groups were scanned using a volumetric three-dimensional fast
      field echo sequence and a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence. Impulsivity
      traits of both groups were evaluated with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11 (BIS
      11). Voxel-based morphometry was used to characterize gray matter (GM) deficits
      in CCS users. The clinical significance of regional volume reduction was
      investigated by evaluating its association with impulsivity in CCS users and with
      alterations in resting state functional connectivity when brain regions with GM
      volume reduction were used as seed areas. RESULTS: Significantly decreased GM
      volume was observed in CCS users in bilateral ventral medial prefrontal cortex
      (vmPFC) which was related to greater impulsivity in CCS users. Significantly
      decreased integration was found in CCS users between the vmPFC and the default
      mode network. Also, significantly enhanced functional connectivity was found
      between the vmPFC and the right insula, and the right dorsal lateral PFC.
      Negative correlation was observed between BIS total scores, scores for
      attentional impulsivity and vmPFC-inferior parietal lobe connectivity in CCS
      users. CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed volume loss and aberrant functional
      organization in vmPFC among CCS users. In addition, the decreased vmPFC GM volume
      and attenuated functional connectivity of the vmPFC-inferior parietal lobe
      network were associated with clinical higher impulsivity trait in CCS users.

      memory search and elaboration.
PG  - 825-39
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00529 [doi]
AB  - Successful retrieval of an event includes an initial search phase in which the
      information is accessed and a subsequent elaboration phase in which an individual
      expands on event details. Traditionally, functional neuroimaging studies
      examining episodic memory retrieval either have not made a distinction between
      these two phases or have focused on the initial search process. The current study
      used an extended retrieval trial to compare the neural correlates of search and
      elaboration and to examine the effects of emotion on each phase. Before scanning,
      participants encoded positive, negative, and neutral images paired with neutral
      titles. After a 30-min delay, participants engaged in a scanned recognition task 
      in which they viewed the neutral titles and indicated whether the title had been 
      presented with an image during the study phase. Retrieval was divided into an
      initial memory search and a subsequent 5-sec elaboration phase. The current study
      identified neural differences between the search and elaboration phases, with
      search being associated with widespread bilateral activations across the entire
      cortex and elaboration primarily being associated with increased activity in the 
      medial pFC. The emotionality of the retrieval target was more influential during 
      search relative to elaboration. However, valence influenced when the effect of
      emotion was greatest, with search engaging many more regions for positive events 
      than negative ones, but elaboration engaging the dorsomedial pFC more for
      negative events than positive events.

AB  - In this study we use high resolution Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) and apply
      rigorous manual tracing criteria in order to assess volumetrically the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) in schizophrenia. Previous MRI studies suggested PFC is included in 
      neural systems necessary for emotional processing and cognition, and regional PFC
      abnormalities might, thus, lead to specific negative symptoms, as well as a
      frequent association of poorer performance in category switching. The aim of this
      study was to use 3T imaging and reliable manual parcellation to determine if, as 
      hypothesized, this higher precision would reveal additional MRI abnormalities in 
      PFC in schizophrenia, and an association between PFC abnormalities and specific
      negative symptoms, as well as in category switching. Using 3-T MRI, 27
      schizophrenia patients and 27 healthy controls were examined. PFC was manually
      parcellated into frontal pole, superior frontal gyrus (SFG), middle frontal gyrus
      (MFG), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Left SFG (p=0.004), bilateral MFG (left:
      p=0.007; right: p=0.007), and bilateral IFG (left: p<0.001; right: p=0.002)
      showed volume reduction. There were symptom associations between smaller left MFG
      volumes and more affective flattening (R=-0.465, p=0.015), and smaller left IFG
      volumes and poorer performance on the alternating semantic category test
      (R=0.440, p=0.025). In summary, 3-T imaging revealed widespread gyral volume
      deficits in PFC gyri, and specific associations with selective negative symptoms,
      such as affective flattening, and with deficits in cognitive switching.

TI  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) to Treat Social Anxiety
      Disorder: Case Reports and a Review of the Literature.
PG  - 180-8
LID - 10.2174/1745017901309010180 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common and debilitating anxiety
      disorders. However, few studies had been dedicated to the neurobiology underlying
      SAD until the last decade. Rates of non-responders to standard methods of
      treatment remain unsatisfactorily high of approximately 25%, including SAD.
      Advances in our understanding of SAD could lead to new treatment strategies. A
      potential non invasive therapeutic option is repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS). Thus, we reported two cases of SAD treated with rTMS Methods:
      The bibliographical search used Pubmed/Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge and Scielo
      databases. The terms chosen for the search were: anxiety disorders, neuroimaging,
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. RESULTS: In most of the studies
      conducted on anxiety disorders, except SAD, the right prefrontal cortex (PFC),
      more specifically dorsolateral PFC was stimulated, with marked results when
      applying high-rTMS compared with studies stimulating the opposite side. However, 
      according to the "valence hypothesis", anxiety disorders might be characterized
      by an interhemispheric imbalance associated with increased right-hemispheric
      activity. With regard to the two cases treated with rTMS, we found a decrease in 
      BDI, BAI and LSAS scores from baseline to follow-up. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize
      that the application of low-rTMS over the right medial PFC (mPFC; the main
      structure involved in SAD circuitry) combined with high-rTMS over the left mPFC, 
      for at least 4 weeks on consecutive weekdays, may induce a balance in brain
      activity, opening an attractive therapeutic option for the treatment of SAD.

TI  - Extinction during reconsolidation of threat memory diminishes prefrontal cortex
      involvement.
PG  - 20040-5
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1320322110 [doi]
AB  - Controlling learned defensive responses through extinction does not alter the
      threat memory itself, but rather regulates its expression via inhibitory
      influence of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) over amygdala. Individual differences in
      amygdala-PFC circuitry function have been linked to trait anxiety and
      posttraumatic stress disorder. This finding suggests that exposure-based
      techniques may actually be least effective in those who suffer from anxiety
      disorders. A theoretical advantage of techniques influencing reconsolidation of
      threat memories is that the threat representation is altered, potentially
      diminishing reliance on this PFC circuitry, resulting in a more persistent
      reduction of defensive reactions. We hypothesized that timing extinction to
      coincide with threat memory reconsolidation would prevent the return of defensive
      reactions and diminish PFC involvement. Two conditioned stimuli (CS) were paired 
      with shock and the third was not. A day later, one stimulus (reminded CS+) but
      not the other (nonreminded CS+) was presented 10 min before extinction to
      reactivate the threat memory, followed by extinction training for all CSs. The
      recovery of the threat memory was tested 24 h later. Extinction of the
      nonreminded CS+ (i.e., standard extinction) engaged the PFC, as previously shown,
      but extinction of the reminded CS+ (i.e., extinction during reconsolidation) did 
      not. Moreover, only the nonreminded CS+ memory recovered on day 3. These results 
      suggest that extinction during reconsolidation prevents the return of defensive
      reactions and diminishes PFC involvement. Reducing the necessity of the
      PFC-amygdala circuitry to control defensive reactions may help overcome a primary
      obstacle in the long-term efficacy of current treatments for anxiety disorders.

TI  - EEG and Neuronal Activity Topography analysis can predict effectiveness of shunt 
      operation in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients.
PG  - 522-30
LID - 10.1016/j.nicl.2013.10.009 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome
      characterized by gait disturbance, cognitive impairment and urinary incontinence 
      that affect elderly individuals. These symptoms can potentially be reversed by
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage or shunt operation. Prior to shunt operation, 
      drainage of a small amount of CSF or "CSF tapping" is usually performed to
      ascertain the effect of the operation. Unfortunately, conventional neuroimaging
      methods such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as well as electroencephalogram (EEG) power
      analysis seem to have failed to detect the effect of CSF tapping on brain
      function. In this work, we propose the use of Neuronal Activity Topography (NAT) 
      analysis, which calculates normalized power variance (NPV) of EEG waves, to
      detect cortical functional changes induced by CSF tapping in iNPH. Based on
      clinical improvement by CSF tapping and shunt operation, we classified 24 iNPH
      patients into responders (N = 11) and nonresponders (N = 13), and performed both 
      EEG power analysis and NAT analysis. We also assessed correlations between
      changes in NPV and changes in functional scores on gait and cognition scales
      before and after CSF tapping. NAT analysis showed that after CSF tapping there
      was a significant decrease in alpha NPV at the medial frontal cortex (FC) (Fz) in
      responders, while nonresponders exhibited an increase in alpha NPV at the right
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (F8). Furthermore, we found correlations
      between cortical functional changes and clinical symptoms. In particular, delta
      and alpha NPV changes in the left-dorsal FC (F3) correlated with changes in gait 
      status, while alpha and beta NPV changes in the right anterior prefrontal cortex 
      (PFC) (Fp2) and left DLPFC (F7) as well as alpha NPV changes in the medial FC
      (Fz) correlated with changes in gait velocity. In addition, alpha NPV changes in 
      the right DLPFC (F8) correlated with changes in WMS-R Mental Control scores in
      iNPH patients. An additional analysis combining the changes in values of alpha
      NPV over the left-dorsal FC (alpha-F3-NPV) and the medial FC (alpha-Fz-NPV)
      induced by CSF tapping (cut-off value of alpha-F3-NPV + alpha-Fz-NPV = 0), could 
      correctly identified "shunt responders" and "shunt nonresponders" with a positive
      predictive value of 100% (10/10) and a negative predictive value of 66% (2/3). In
      contrast, EEG power spectral analysis showed no function related changes in
      cortical activity at the frontal cortex before and after CSF tapping. These
      results indicate that the clinical changes in gait and response suppression
      induced by CSF tapping in iNPH patients manifest as NPV changes, particularly in 
      the alpha band, rather than as EEG power changes. Our findings suggest that NAT
      analysis can detect CSF tapping-induced functional changes in cortical activity, 
      in a way that no other neuroimaging methods have been able to do so far, and can 
      predict clinical response to shunt operation in patients with iNPH.

AB  - Abnormalities in functional limbic-anterior cingulate-prefrontal circuits
      associated with emotional reactivity, evaluation and regulation have been
      implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). However,
      existing knowledge about structural alterations in depression is equivocal and
      based on cohorts of limited sample size. This study used voxel-based morphometry 
      (VBM) and surface-based cortical thickness to investigate the structure of these 
      circuits in a large and well-characterized patient cohort with MDD. Non-geriatric
      MDD outpatients (n = 102) and age- and gender-matched healthy control
      participants (n = 34) provided T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data during
      their baseline visit as part of the International Study to Predict Optimized
      Treatment for Depression. Whole-brain VBM volumetric and surface-based cortical
      thickness assessments were performed voxel-wise and compared (at p < 0.05
      corrected for multiple comparisons) between the MDD and control groups. MDD
      participants had reduced gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex,
      regions of the prefrontal circuits, including dorsolateral and dorsomedial
      prefrontal cortices, and lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortices, but not in
      limbic regions. Additional reductions were observed cortically in the posterior
      temporal and parieto-occipital cortices and, subcortically in the basal ganglia
      and cerebellum. Focal cortical thinning in the medial orbitofrontal cortex was
      also observed for the MDD group. These alterations in volume and cortical
      thickness were not associated with severity of depressive symptoms. The findings 
      demonstrate that widespread gray matter structural abnormalities are present in a
      well-powered study of patients with depression. The patterns of gray matter loss 
      correspond to the same brain functional network regions that were previously
      established to be abnormal in MDD, which may support an underlying structural
      abnormality for these circuits.

AB  - Dopamine deficiency affects functional integration of activity in distributed
      neural regions. It has been suggested that lack of dopamine induces disruption of
      neural interactions between prefrontal and premotor areas, which might underlie
      impairment of motor control observed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
      In this study we recorded cortical activity with high-density
      electroencephalography in 11 patients with PD as a pathological model of dopamine
      deficiency, and 13 healthy control subjects. Participants performed repetitive
      extension-flexion movements of their right index finger, which were externally
      paced at a rate of 0.5 Hz. This required participants to align their movement
      velocity to the slow external pace. Patients were studied after at least 12-hour 
      withdrawal of dopaminergic medication (OFF state) and after intake of the
      dopamine precursor levodopa (ON state) in order to examine oscillatory coupling
      between prefrontal and premotor areas during respectively low and high levels of 
      dopamine. In 10 patients and 12 control participants multiple source beamformer
      analysis yielded task-related activation of a contralateral cortical network
      comprising prefrontal cortex (PFC), lateral premotor cortex (lPM), supplementary 
      motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1). Dynamic causal modelling was used
      to characterize task-related oscillatory coupling between prefrontal and premotor
      cortical areas. Healthy participants showed task-induced coupling from PFC to
      SMA, which was modulated within the gamma-band. In the OFF state, PD patients did
      not express any frequency-specific coupling between prefrontal and premotor
      areas. Application of levodopa reinstated task-related coupling from PFC to SMA, 
      which was expressed as high-beta-gamma coupling. Additionally, strong
      within-frequency gamma-coupling as well as cross-frequency theta-gamma coupling
      was observed from PFC to lPM. Enhancement of this cross-frequency theta-gamma
      coupling after application of levodopa was positively correlated with individual 
      improvement in motor function. The results demonstrate that dopamine deficiency
      impairs the ability to establish oscillatory coupling between prefrontal and
      premotor areas during an externally paced motor task. Application of extrinsic
      dopamine in PD patients reinstates physiological prefrontal-premotor coupling and
      additionally induces within- and cross-frequency coupling from prefrontal to
      premotor areas, which is not expressed in healthy participants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol dependence (AD) is a multiorgan disease in which excessive
      oxidative stress and apoptosis are implicated. Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) is an 
      important enzyme on the outer mitochondrial membrane that participates in the
      cellular response to oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicity. It is unknown
      whether MAO-A levels are abnormal in AD. We hypothesized that MAO-A VT, an index 
      of MAO-A level, is elevated in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during AD, because
      markers of greater oxidative stress and apoptosis are reported in the brain in AD
      and a microarray analysis reported greater MAO-A messenger RNA in the PFC of
      rodents exposed to alcohol vapor. METHODS: Sixteen participants with alcohol
      dependence and 16 healthy control subjects underwent [(11)C]-harmine positron
      emission tomography. All were nonsmoking, medication- and drug-free, and had no
      other past or present psychiatric or medical illnesses. RESULTS: MAO-A VT was
      significantly greater in the PFC (37%, independent samples t test, t(3)(0) =
      3.93, p < .001), and all brain regions analyzed (mean 32%, multivariate analysis 
      of variance, F(7),(2)(4) = 3.67, p = .008). Greater duration of heavy drinking
      correlated positively with greater MAO-A VT in the PFC (r = .67, p = .005) and
      all brain regions analyzed (r = .73 to .57, p = .001-.02). CONCLUSIONS: This
      finding represents a new pathological marker present in AD that is
      therapeutically targetable through direct inhibition or by novel treatments
      toward oxidative/pro-apoptotic processes implicated by MAO-A overexpression.

AB  - The dorsolateral pFC (DLPFC) is a key region for working memory. It has been
      proposed that the DLPFC is dynamically recruited depending on task demands. By
      this view, high DLPFC recruitment for low-demanding tasks along with weak DLPFC
      upregulation at higher task demands reflects low efficiency. Here, the fMRI BOLD 
      signal during working memory maintenance and manipulation was examined in
      relation to aging and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val(158)Met status in a
      large representative sample (n = 287). The efficiency hypothesis predicts a
      weaker DLPFC response during manipulation, along with a stronger response during 
      maintenance for older adults and COMT Val carriers compared with younger adults
      and COMT Met carriers. Consistent with the hypothesis, younger adults and met
      carriers showed maximal DLPFC BOLD response during manipulation, whereas older
      adults and val carriers displayed elevated DLPFC responses during the less
      demanding maintenance condition. The observed inverted relations support a link
      between dopamine and DLPFC efficiency.

      within the medial prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 683-98
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00520 [doi]
AB  - The medial pFC (mPFC) is frequently reported to play a central role in Theory of 
      Mind (ToM). However, the contribution of this large cortical region in ToM is not
      well understood. Combining a novel behavioral task with fMRI, we sought to
      demonstrate functional divisions between dorsal and rostral mPFC. All conditions 
      of the task required the representation of mental states (beliefs and desires).
      The level of demands on cognitive control (high vs. low) and the nature of the
      demands on reasoning (deductive vs. abductive) were varied orthogonally between
      conditions. Activation in dorsal mPFC was modulated by the need for control,
      whereas rostral mPFC was modulated by reasoning demands. These findings fit with 
      previously suggested domain-general functions for different parts of mPFC and
      suggest that these functions are recruited selectively in the service of ToM.

AB  - Human neuroimaging studies suggest that neural cue reactivity is strongly
      associated with indices of drug use, including addiction severity and treatment
      success. However, little is known about factors that modulate cue reactivity. The
      goal of this review, in which we survey published fMRI and PET studies on drug
      cue reactivity in cocaine, alcohol, and tobacco cigarette users, is to highlight 
      major factors that modulate brain reactivity to drug cues. First, we describe cue
      reactivity paradigms used in neuroimaging research and outline the brain circuits
      that underlie cue reactivity. We then discuss major factors that have been shown 
      to modulate cue reactivity and review specific evidence as well as outstanding
      questions related to each factor. Building on previous model-building reviews on 
      the topic, we then outline a simplified model that includes the key modulatory
      factors and a tentative ranking of their relative impact. We conclude with a
      discussion of outstanding challenges and future research directions, which can
      inform future neuroimaging studies as well as the design of treatment and
      prevention programs.

      default network (brain regions typically deactivated for attention-demanding
      tasks) as measured by resting-state fMRI in children, adolescents, and young
      adults ages 8-24 years. We investigated both positive and negative correlations
      and employed analysis methods that allowed for valid interpretation of negative
      correlations and that also minimized the influence of motion artifacts that are
      often confounds in developmental neuroimaging. As age increased, there were
      robust developmental increases in negative correlations, including those between 
      medial pFC (MPFC) and dorsolateral pFC (DLPFC) and between lateral parietal
      cortices and brain regions associated with the dorsal attention network. Between 
      multiple regions, these correlations reversed from being positive in children to 
      negative in adults. Age-related changes in positive correlations within the
      default network were below statistical threshold after controlling for motion.
      Given evidence in adults that greater negative correlation between MPFC and DLPFC
      is associated with superior cognitive performance, the development of an
      intrinsic anticorrelation between MPFC and DLPFC may be a marker of the large
      growth of working memory and executive functions that occurs from childhood to
      young adulthood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies show superior temporal 
      gyrus (STG) auditory processing abnormalities in schizophrenia at 50 and 100 ms, 
      EEG and corticography studies suggest involvement of additional brain areas
      (e.g., frontal areas) during this interval. Study goals were to identify 30 to
      130 ms auditory encoding processes in schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy controls
      (HC) and group differences throughout the cortex. METHODS: The standard
      paired-click task was administered to 19 SZ and 21 HC subjects during MEG
      recording. Vector-based Spatial-temporal Analysis using L1-minimum-norm (VESTAL) 
      provided 4D maps of activity from 30 to 130 ms. Within-group t-tests compared
      post-stimulus 50 ms and 100 ms activity to baseline. Between-group t-tests
      examined 50 and 100 ms group differences. RESULTS: Bilateral 50 and 100 ms STG
      activity was observed in both groups. HC had stronger bilateral 50 and 100 ms STG
      activity than SZ. In addition to the STG group difference, non-STG activity was
      also observed in both groups. For example, whereas HC had stronger left and right
      inferior frontal gyrus activity than SZ, SZ had stronger right superior frontal
      gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus activity than HC. CONCLUSIONS: Less STG
      activity was observed in SZ than HC, indicating encoding problems in SZ. Yet
      auditory encoding abnormalities are not specific to STG, as group differences
      were observed in frontal and SMG areas. Thus, present findings indicate that
      individuals with SZ show abnormalities in multiple nodes of a concurrently
      activated auditory network.

AB  - Mindfulness training aims to impact emotion regulation. Generalized anxiety
      disorder (GAD) symptoms can be successfully addressed through mindfulness-based
      interventions. This preliminary study is the first to investigate neural
      mechanisms of symptom improvements in GAD following mindfulness training.
      Furthermore, we compared brain activation between GAD patients and healthy
      participants at baseline. 26 patients with a current DSM-IV GAD diagnosis were
      randomized to an 8-week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR, N = 15) or a
      stress management education (SME, N = 11) active control program. 26 healthy
      participants were included for baseline comparisons. BOLD response was assessed
      with fMRI during affect labeling of angry and neutral facial expressions. At
      baseline, GAD patients showed higher amygdala activation than healthy
      participants in response to neutral, but not angry faces, suggesting that
      ambiguous stimuli reveal stronger reactivity in GAD patients. In patients,
      amygdala activation in response to neutral faces decreased following both
      interventions. BOLD response in ventrolateral prefrontal regions (VLPFC) showed
      greater increase in MBSR than SME participants. Functional connectivity between
      amygdala and PFC regions increased significantly pre- to post-intervention within
      the MBSR, but not SME group. Both, change in VLPFC activation and
      amygdala-prefrontal connectivity were correlated with change in Beck Anxiety
      Inventory (BAI) scores, suggesting clinical relevance of these changes.
      Amygdala-prefrontal connectivity turned from negative coupling (typically seen in
      down-regulation of emotions), to positive coupling; potentially suggesting a
      unique mechanism of mindfulness. Findings suggest that in GAD, mindfulness
      training leads to changes in fronto-limbic areas crucial for the regulation of
      emotion; these changes correspond with reported symptom improvements.

TI  - Local cortical thinning links to resting-state disconnectivity in major
      depressive disorder.
PG  - 2053-65
LID - 10.1017/S0033291713002742 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Local structural and metabolic as well as inter-regional connectivity
      abnormalities have been implicated in the neuropathology of major depressive
      disorder (MDD). How local tissue properties affect intrinsic functional
      connectivity is, however, unclear. Using a cross-sectional, multi-modal imaging
      approach, we investigated the relationship between local cortical tissue
      abnormalities and intrinsic resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in MDD. 
      METHOD: A total of 20 MDD in-patients and 20 healthy controls underwent magnetic 
      resonance imaging at 3 T for structural and functional imaging. Whole-brain
      cortical thickness was calculated and compared between groups. Regions with
      reduced cortical thickness defined seeds for subsequent whole-brain RSFC
      analyses. Contributions of structural tissue abnormalities on inter-regional RSFC
      were explicitly investigated. RESULTS: Lower cortical thickness was observed in
      MDD in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), superior temporal
      gyrus/temporal pole, middle-posterior cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral PFC. No 
      differences in local fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations were
      observed. Lower thickness in patients' dorsomedial PFC further directly and
      selectively affected its RSFC with the precuneus, which was unaffected by symptom
      severity. No effects of cortical thickness in other regions showing abnormal
      thickness were observed to influence functional connectivity. CONCLUSIONS:
      Abnormal cortical thickness in the dorsomedial PFC in MDD patients was observed
      to selectively and directly affect its intrinsic connectivity with the precuneus 
      in MDD patients independent of depression severity, thereby marking a potential
      vulnerability for maladaptive mood regulation. Future studies should include an
      unmedicated sample and replicate findings using independent component analysis to
      test for morphometric effects on network integrity.

AB  - Effective decision-making requires consideration of costs and benefits. Previous 
      studies have implicated orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (DLPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in cost-benefit
      decision-making. Yet controversy remains about whether different decision costs
      are encoded by different brain areas, and whether single neurons integrate costs 
      and benefits to derive a subjective value estimate for each choice alternative.
      To address these issues, we trained four subjects to perform delay- and
      effort-based cost-benefit decisions and recorded neuronal activity in OFC, ACC,
      DLPFC, and the cingulate motor area (CMA). Although some neurons, mainly in ACC, 
      did exhibit integrated value signals as if performing cost-benefit computations, 
      they were relatively few in number. Instead, the majority of neurons in all areas
      encoded the decision type; that is whether the subject was required to perform a 
      delay- or effort-based decision. OFC and DLPFC neurons tended to show the largest
      changes in firing rate for delay- but not effort-based decisions; whereas, the
      reverse was true for CMA neurons. Only ACC contained neurons modulated by both
      effort- and delay-based decisions. These findings challenge the idea that OFC
      calculates an abstract value signal to guide decision-making. Instead, our
      results suggest that an important function of single PFC neurons is to categorize
      sensory stimuli based on the consequences predicted by those stimuli.

AB  - Successful realization of planned actions requires the brain to encode intentions
      over delays. Previous research has indicated that several regions in the rostral 
      or anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC) encode delayed intentions. However, different
      processes may encode the same future task depending on task load during the
      delay. This difference may depend on the computational resources available when
      the delay is occupied with an ongoing task and when it is task-free. Here we
      directly investigated and compared the representation of delayed intentions in
      the human brain in the presence and absence of ongoing task load during the
      delay. We acquired fMRI data in combination with an event-based prospective
      memory design where human subjects remembered to perform the same future tasks
      over occupied and task-free delays. We used time-resolved multivoxel pattern
      classification and found that: (1) rostrolateral PFC (BA 46) encoded the delayed 
      intention during both delay types; (2) rostromedial PFC (BA 10) encoded the
      intentions during occupied delays; whereas (3) a variety of more posterior
      regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24), the supplementary motor
      area (BA 6), and the precuneus, encoded intentions during task-free delays.
      Overall, the medial PFC encoded delayed intentions more rostrally in the presence
      of an ongoing delay task and more caudally in its absence. Thus, rostromedial PFC
      may play a specialized role in the encoding of prospective memory that depends on
      higher computational demands (e.g., given higher task load during the delay). In 
      contrast, the rostrolateral PFC is a more general area that encodes future
      intentions regardless of task load.

AB  - When explaining the reasons for others' behavior, perceivers often overemphasize 
      underlying dispositions and personality traits over the power of the situation, a
      tendency known as the fundamental attribution error. One possibility is that this
      bias results from the spontaneous processing of others' mental states, such as
      their momentary feelings or more enduring personality characteristics. Here, we
      use fMRI to test this hypothesis. Participants read a series of stories that
      described a target's ambiguous behavior in response to a specific social
      situation and later judged whether that act was attributable to the target's
      internal dispositions or to external situational factors. Neural regions
      consistently associated with mental state inference-especially, the medial
      pFC-strongly predicted whether participants later made dispositional
      attributions. These results suggest that the spontaneous engagement of
      mentalizing may underlie the biased tendency to attribute behavior to
      dispositional over situational forces.

TI  - Negative urgency and ventromedial prefrontal cortex responses to alcohol cues:
      FMRI evidence of emotion-based impulsivity.
PG  - 409-17
LID - 10.1111/acer.12266 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent research has highlighted the role of emotion-based impulsivity
      (negative and positive urgency personality traits) for alcohol use and abuse, but
      has yet to examine how these personality traits interact with the brain's
      motivational systems. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we
      tested whether urgency traits and mood induction affected medial prefrontal
      responses to alcohol odors (AcO). METHODS: Twenty-seven social drinkers (mean age
      = 25.2, 14 males) had 6 fMRI scans while viewing negative, neutral, or positive
      mood images (3 mood conditions) during intermittent exposure to AcO and
      appetitive control (AppCo) aromas. RESULTS: Voxel-wise analyses (p < 0.001)
      confirmed [AcO > AppCo] activation throughout medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and
      ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) regions. Extracted from a priori mPFC and vmPFC regions 
      and analyzed in Odor (AcO, AppCo) x Mood factorial models, AcO activation was
      greater than AppCo in left vmPFC (p < 0.001), left mPFC (p = 0.002), and right
      vmPFC (p = 0.01) regions. Mood did not interact significantly with activation,
      but the covariate of trait negative urgency accounted for significant variance in
      left vmPFC (p = 0.01) and right vmPFC (p = 0.01) [AcO > AppCo] activation.
      Negative urgency also mediated the relationship between vmPFC activation and both
      (i) subjective craving and (ii) problematic drinking. CONCLUSIONS: The trait of
      negative urgency is associated with neural responses to alcohol cues in the
      vmPFC, a region involved in reward value and emotion-guided decision-making. This
      suggests that negative urgency might alter subjective craving and brain regions
      involved in coding reward value.

TI  - Less wiring, more firing: low-performing older adults compensate for impaired
      white matter with greater neural activity.
PG  - 983-90
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bht289 [doi]
AB  - The reliable neuroimaging finding that older adults often show greater activity
      (over-recruitment) than younger adults is typically attributed to compensation.
      Yet, the neural mechanisms of over-recruitment in older adults (OAs) are largely 
      unknown. Rodent electrophysiology studies have shown that as number of afferent
      fibers within a circuit decreases with age, the fibers that remain show higher
      synaptic field potentials (less wiring, more firing). Extrapolating to
      system-level measures in humans, we proposed and tested the hypothesis that
      greater activity in OAs compensates for impaired white-matter connectivity. Using
      a neuropsychological test battery, we measured individual differences in
      executive functions associated with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and memory
      functions associated with the medial temporal lobes (MTLs). Using event-related
      functional magnetic resonance imaging, we compared activity for successful versus
      unsuccessful trials during a source memory task. Finally, we measured
      white-matter integrity using diffusion tensor imaging. The study yielded 3 main
      findings. First, low-executive OAs showed greater success-related activity in the
      PFC, whereas low-memory OAs showed greater success-related activity in the MTLs. 
      Second, low-executive OAs displayed white-matter deficits in the PFC, whereas
      low-memory OAs displayed white-matter deficits in the MTLs. Finally, in both
      prefrontal and MTL regions, white-matter decline and success-related activations 
      occurred in close proximity and were negatively correlated. This finding supports
      the less-wiring-more-firing hypothesis, which provides a testable account of
      compensatory over-recruitment in OAs.

TI  - Functional connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in
      medication-naive individuals with major depressive disorder.
PG  - 417-22
LID - 10.1503/jpn.120117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Convergent evidence suggests dysfunction within the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) and amygdala, important components of a neural system that subserves
      emotional processing, in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD).
      Abnormalities in this system in the left hemisphere and during processing of
      negative emotional stimuli are especially implicated. In this study, we used
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate amygdala-PFC
      functional connectivity during emotional face processing in medication-naive
      individuals with MDD. METHODS: Individuals with MDD and healthy controls
      underwent fMRI scanning while processing 3 types of emotional face stimuli. We
      compared the strength of functional connectivity from the amygdala between the
      MDD and control groups. RESULTS: Our study included 28 individuals with MDD and
      30 controls. Decreased amygdala-left rostral PFC (rPFC) functional connectivity
      was observed in the MDD group compared with controls for the fear condition (p < 
      0.05, corrected). No significant differences were found in amygdala connectivity 
      to any cerebral regions between the MDD and control groups for the happy or
      neutral conditions. LIMITATIONS: All participants with MDD were experiencing
      acute episodes, therefore the findings could not be generalized to the entire MDD
      population. CONCLUSION: Medication-naive individuals with MDD showed decreased
      amygdala-left rPFC functional connectivity in response to negative emotional
      stimuli, suggesting that abnormalities in amygdala-left rPFC neural circuitry
      responses to negative emotional stimuli might play an important role in the
      pathophysiology of MDD.

TI  - Dorsolateral pFC and the representation of the incorrect use of an object: the
      transcranial direct current stimulation effect on N400 for visual and linguistic 
      stimuli.
PG  - 305-18
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00500 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we explored the representation of an incongruent action
      (instrumentally incorrect use of an object) in comparison with sentences ending
      with an incongruent action word, taking into account the role of the activation
      of the left dorsolateral pFC (DLPFC). This activity was appositely modulated by
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The effect of tDCS when
      participants processed congruent/incongruent object-related actions (Experiment
      1) or sentences (Experiment 2) was verified by measuring changes in the ERP N400,
      error rates (ERs), and RTs. In Experiment 1, 30 participants performed the
      detection task within a dynamic context (video tapes representing a sequence of
      four action frames). In Experiment 2, 28 participants read sentences that
      represented object-related actions. The stimulation effect (a cathode applied to 
      the DLPFC and an anode to the right supraorbital region) was analyzed by
      comparing the ER, RT, and ERP profiles before and after stimulation (or sham
      treatment). A significant reduction of the N400 was observed for incongruent
      stimuli in the case of cathodal (inhibitory) stimulation of the DLPFC in
      comparison with prestimulation conditions for Experiment 1, but not Experiment 2.
      Moreover, ERs were increased, and RTs were reduced in response to incongruent
      conditions after tDCS, but not after sham stimulation in Experiment 1. It is
      suggested that perturbation of the DLPFC may limit the ability to analyze a
      semantically anomalous action sequence as a reduced N400 ERP effect and increased
      random responses was observed. Finally, the contribution of the frontal area to
      the semantic processing of actions is discussed.

PG  - 551-68
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00504 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the functional properties of a previously described
      cingulo-opercular network (CON) putatively involved in cognitive control.
      Analyses of common fMRI task-evoked activity during perceptual and episodic
      memory search tasks that differently recruited the dorsal attention (DAN) and
      default mode network (DMN) established the generality of this network. Regions
      within the CON (anterior insula/frontal operculum and anterior
      cingulate/presupplementary cortex) displayed sustained signals during extended
      periods in which participants searched for behaviorally relevant information in a
      dynamically changing environment or from episodic memory in the absence of
      sensory stimulation. The CON was activated during all phases of both tasks, which
      involved trial initiation, target detection, decision, and response, indicating
      its consistent involvement in a broad range of cognitive processes. Functional
      connectivity analyses showed that the CON flexibly linked with the DAN or DMN
      regions during perceptual or memory search, respectively. Aside from the CON,
      only a limited number of regions, including the lateral pFC, showed evidence of
      domain-general sustained activity, although in some cases the common activations 
      may have reflected the functional-anatomical variability of domain-specific
      regions rather than a true domain generality. These additional regions also
      showed task-dependent functional connectivity with the DMN and DAN, suggesting
      that this feature is not a specific marker of cognitive control. Finally,
      multivariate clustering analyses separated the CON from other frontoparietal
      regions previously associated with cognitive control, indicating a unique
      fingerprint. We conclude that the CON's functional properties and interactions
      with other brain regions support a broad role in cognition, consistent with its
      characterization as a task control network.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeated exposure to the traumatic memory (RETM) is a common
      component of treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This treatment 
      is based on a fear extinction model; however, the degree to which this treatment 
      actually engages and modifies neural networks mediating fear extinction is
      unknown. Therefore, the purpose of the current exploratory study was to define
      the dynamic changes in neural processing networks while participants completed a 
      novel adaptation of RETM. METHOD: Participants were adult women (N = 16) with
      PTSD related to physical or sexual assault. Prior to scanning, participants
      provided written narratives of a traumatic event related to their PTSD as well as
      a neutral control event. RETM during fMRI consisted of 5 sequential presentations
      of the blocked narrative types, lasting three minutes each. Self-reported anxiety
      was assessed after each presentation. RESULTS: Relative to changes in functional 
      connectivity during the neutral control script, RETM was associated with
      strengthened functional connectivity of the right amygdala with the right
      hippocampus and right anterior insular cortex, left amygdala with the right
      insular cortex, medial PFC with right anterior insula, left hippocampus with
      striatum and dorsal cingulate cortex, and right hippocampus with striatum and
      orbitofrontal cortex. Greater PTSD severity generally led to less changes in
      functional connectivity with the right insular cortex. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      provide evidence that RETM engages and modifies functional connectivity pathways 
      with neural regions implicated in fear extinction. The results also implicate the
      engagement of the right insular cortex and striatum during RETM and suggest their
      importance in human fear extinction to trauma memories. However, comorbidity in
      the sample and the lack of a control group limit inferences regarding RETM with
      PTSD populations specifically.

TI  - Risk-taking behavior in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.
PG  - 2158-65
LID - 10.1111/epi.12413 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) often present with
      risk-taking behavior, suggestive of frontal lobe dysfunction. Recent studies
      confirm functional and microstructural changes within the frontal lobes in JME.
      This study aimed at characterizing decision-making behavior in JME and its
      neuronal correlates using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: 
      We investigated impulsivity in 21 JME patients and 11 controls using the Iowa
      Gambling Task (IGT), which measures decision making under ambiguity. Performance 
      on the IGT was correlated with activation patterns during an fMRI working memory 
      task. RESULTS: Both patients and controls learned throughout the task. Post hoc
      analysis revealed a greater proportion of patients with seizures than
      seizure-free patients having difficulties in advantageous decision making, but no
      difference in performance between seizure-free patients and controls. Functional 
      imaging of working memory networks showed that overall poor IGT performance was
      associated with an increased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) in JME patients. Impaired learning during the task and ongoing seizures
      were associated with bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
      presupplementary motor area, right superior frontal gyrus, and left DLPFC
      activation. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides evidence that patients with JME and 
      ongoing seizures learn significantly less from previous experience. Interictal
      dysfunction within "normal" working memory networks, specifically, within the
      DLPFC and medial PFC structures, may affect their ability to learn.

TI  - Executive control circuitry differentiates degree of success in weight loss
      following gastric-bypass surgery.
PG  - 2189-96
LID - 10.1002/oby.20575 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: While overall success rates of bariatric surgery are high,
      approximately 20% of patients either regain or never lose the expected amount of 
      weight. The purpose of this study was to determine whether, after gastric-bypass 
      surgery, the degree of weight loss can be differentiated based on the neural
      response to food cues. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this functional MRI study, 31
      post-surgical patients viewed food and neutral images in two counterbalanced runs
      during which they were either instructed to "crave" or to "resist" craving. The
      neural response to food cues was assessed within and between runs for all
      participants, and further analyzed between more successful (n = 24) and less
      successful (n = 7) groups. More successful was defined by meeting 50% excess
      weight loss. RESULTS: Overall, instructions to "crave" elicited significant
      activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) whereas "resist" elicited
      significant activity in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC). Between groups there was no
      brain difference when instructed to "crave." The more successful participants
      however had significantly more activity in the DLPFC when instructed to "resist."
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the ability to mobilize neural circuits 
      involved in executive control post-gastric-bypass surgery may be a unique
      component of successful outcome post-surgery.

TI  - Sub-anesthetic ketamine modulates intrinsic BOLD connectivity within the
      hippocampal-prefrontal circuit in the rat.
PG  - 895-906
LID - 10.1038/npp.2013.290 [doi]
AB  - Dysfunctional connectivity within the hippocampal-prefrontal circuit (HC-PFC) is 
      associated with schizophrenia, major depression, and neurodegenerative disorders,
      and both the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex have dense populations of
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Ketamine, a potent NMDA receptor
      antagonist, is of substantial current interest as a mechanistic model of
      glutamatergic dysfunction in animal and human studies, a psychotomimetic agent
      and a rapidly acting antidepressant. In this study, we sought to understand the
      modulatory effect of acute ketamine administration on functional connectivity in 
      the HC-PFC system of the rat brain using resting-state fMRI. Sprague-Dawley rats 
      in four parallel groups (N=9 per group) received either saline or one of three
      behaviorally relevant, sub-anesthetic doses of S-ketamine (5, 10, and 25 mg/kg,
      s.c.), and connectivity changes 15- and 30-min post-injection were studied. The
      strongest effects were dose- and exposure-dependent increases in functional
      connectivity within the prefrontal cortex and in anterior-posterior connections
      between the posterior hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex, and prefrontal
      regions. The increased prefrontal connectivity is consistent with
      ketamine-induced increases in HC-PFC electroencephalographic gamma band power,
      possibly reflecting a psychotomimetic aspect of ketamine's effect, and is
      contrary to the data from chronic schizophrenic patients suggesting that ketamine
      effect does not necessarily parallel the disease pattern but might rather reflect
      a hyperglutamatergic state. These findings may help to clarify the brain systems 
      underlying different dose-dependent behavioral profiles of ketamine in the rat.

AB  - Temporal discounting occurs when a greater delayed reward is forsaken for a
      smaller immediate reward, and has been associated with a number of financial and 
      health care outcomes important for older adults. Using resting-state fMRI and
      seed regions of interest in the left and right fronto-insular (FI) cortices, we
      explored the neurobiological substrate of temporal discounting in 123
      non-demented older adults from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. For the left FI
      cortex, temporal discounting was positively associated with functional
      connectivity to the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex and middle temporal
      regions, and negatively associated with parahippocampal and right cerebellar
      regions. For the right FI cortex, temporal discounting was negatively associated 
      with functional connectivity to a right cerebellar region. Connectivity maps of
      both left and right seed regions of interest overlapped in the right cerebellum. 
      Results support the notion of different brain functional connectivity patterns
      associated with the dynamic range of temporal discounting in old age.

TI  - A review of neuroimaging studies of young relatives of individuals with
      schizophrenia: a developmental perspective from schizotaxia to schizophrenia.
PG  - 604-35
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32170 [doi]
AB  - In an effort to identify the developing abnormalities preceding psychosis, Dr.
      Ming T. Tsuang and colleagues at Harvard expanded Meehl's concept of
      "schizotaxia," and examined brain structure and function in families affected by 
      schizophrenia (SZ). Here, we systematically review genetic (familial) high-risk
      (HR) studies of SZ using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), examine how findings
      inform models of SZ etiology, and suggest directions for future research.
      Neuroimaging studies of youth at HR for SZ through the age of 30 were identified 
      through a MEDLINE (PubMed) search. There is substantial evidence of gray matter
      volume abnormalities in youth at HR compared to controls, with an accelerated
      volume reduction over time in association with symptoms and cognitive deficits.
      In structural neuroimaging studies, prefrontal cortex (PFC) alterations were the 
      most consistently reported finding in HR. There was also consistent evidence of
      smaller hippocampal volume. In functional studies, hyperactivity of the right PFC
      during performance of diverse tasks with common executive demands was
      consistently reported. The only longitudinal fMRI study to date revealed
      increasing left middle temporal activity in association with the emergence of
      psychotic symptoms. There was preliminary evidence of cerebellar and default mode
      network alterations in association with symptoms. Brain abnormalities in
      structure, function and neurochemistry are observed in the premorbid period in
      youth at HR for SZ. Future research should focus on the genetic and environmental
      contributions to these alterations, determine how early they emerge, and
      determine whether they can be partially or fully remediated by innovative
      treatments.

      Changing food preferences is an important strategy in addressing the obesity
      epidemic and its accompanying public health risks. However, little is known about
      how food preferences can be effectively affected and what neural systems support 
      such changes. In this study, we investigated a novel extensive training paradigm 
      where participants chose from specific pairs of palatable junk food items and
      were rewarded for choosing the items with lower subjective value over higher
      value ones. In a later probe phase, when choices were made for real consumption, 
      participants chose the lower-valued item more often in the trained pairs compared
      with untrained pairs. We replicated the behavioral results in an independent
      sample of participants while they were scanned with fMRI. We found that, as
      training progressed, there was decreased recruitment of regions that have been
      previously associated with cognitive control, specifically the left dorsolateral 
      pFC and bilateral parietal cortices. Furthermore, we found that connectivity of
      the left dorsolateral pFC was greater with primary motor regions by the end of
      training for choices of lower-valued items that required exertion of
      self-control, suggesting a formation of a stronger stimulus-response association.
      These findings demonstrate that it is possible to influence food choices through 
      training and that this training is associated with a decreasing need for top-down
      frontoparietal control. The results suggest that training paradigms may be
      promising as the basis for interventions to influence real-world food
      preferences.
