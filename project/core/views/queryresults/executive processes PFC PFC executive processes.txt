AB  - This article is part of a Special Issue "Estradiol and cognition". Subjective
      changes in concentration and memory are commonly reported by women during the
      second or third trimesters of pregnancy, but the nature of the problem is poorly 
      understood. We hypothesized that these self-reports might reflect difficulties in
      working memory (WM). It was further hypothesized that antepartum depression
      (depression arising during pregnancy) may play an etiological role, either on its
      own or due to secondary changes in endocrine function or sleep. Using WM tasks
      that emphasized executive control processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) we compared pregnant women tested at 34-36weeks of gestation (n=28) with
      age- and education-matched non-pregnant controls (n=26). All pregnant women were 
      screened for depression. Evidence of a WM disturbance was found, and was evident 
      only among pregnant women showing depressive symptoms. In contrast, pregnant
      women who were not depressed showed WM performance that equalled, or even
      significantly exceeded, non-pregnant controls. No significant differences were
      observed on control tests of other cognitive functions. Multiple regression
      revealed that serum estradiol concentrations, along with severity of depressive
      affect but not sleep disruption, significantly predicted variation in the WM
      scores. In agreement with studies of estradiol and WM in other contexts, higher
      estradiol was associated with better WM, while higher levels of depressive
      symptoms predicted poorer WM. We conclude that memory disturbance during
      gestation might not be as widespread as commonly believed, but can be seen among 
      women experiencing antepartum depression. The high level of WM performance found 
      in healthy, non-depressed, pregnant women is discussed from an adaptationist
      perspective.

TI  - Neurodynamics of executive control processes in bilinguals: evidence from ERP and
      source reconstruction analyses.
PG  - 821
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00821 [doi]
AB  - The present study was designed to examine the impact of bilingualism on the
      neuronal activity in different executive control processes namely conflict
      monitoring, control implementation (i.e., interference suppression and conflict
      resolution) and overcoming of inhibition. Twenty-two highly proficient but
      non-balanced successive French-German bilingual adults and 22 monolingual adults 
      performed a combined Stroop/Negative priming task while event-related potential
      (ERP) were recorded online. The data revealed that the ERP effects were reduced
      in bilinguals in comparison to monolinguals but only in the Stroop task and
      limited to the N400 and the sustained fronto-central negative-going potential
      time windows. This result suggests that bilingualism may impact the process of
      control implementation rather than the process of conflict monitoring (N200).
      Critically, our study revealed a differential time course of the involvement of
      the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in conflict
      processing. While the ACC showed major activation in the early time windows (N200
      and N400) but not in the latest time window (late sustained negative-going
      potential), the PFC became unilaterally active in the left hemisphere in the N400
      and the late sustained negative-going potential time windows. Taken together, the
      present electroencephalography data lend support to a cascading
      neurophysiological model of executive control processes, in which ACC and PFC may
      play a determining role.

TI  - Autobiographical Planning and the Brain: Activation and Its Modulation by
      Qualitative Features.
PG  - 2147-57
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00846 [doi]
AB  - To engage in purposeful behavior, it is important to make plans, which organize
      subsequent actions. Most studies of planning involve "look-ahead" puzzle tasks
      that are unrelated to personal goals. We developed a task to assess
      autobiographical planning, which involves the formulation of personal plans in
      response to real-world goals, and examined autobiographical planning in 63 adults
      during fMRI scanning. Autobiographical planning was found to engage the default
      network, including medial-temporal lobe and midline structures, and executive
      control regions in lateral pFC and parietal cortex and caudate. To examine how
      specific qualitative features of autobiographical plans modulate neural activity,
      we performed parametric modulation analyses. Ratings of plan detail, novelty,
      temporal distance, ease of plan formulation, difficulty in goal completion, and
      confidence in goal accomplishment were used as covariates in six hierarchical
      linear regression models. This modeling procedure removed shared variance among
      the ratings, allowing us to determine the independent relationship between
      ratings of interest and trial-wise BOLD signal. We found that specific
      autobiographical planning, describing a detailed, achievable, and actionable
      planning process for attaining a clearly envisioned future, recruited both
      default and frontoparietal brain regions. In contrast, abstract autobiographical 
      planning, plans that were constructed from more generalized semantic or affective
      representations of a less tangible and distant future, involved interactions
      among default, sensory perceptual, and limbic brain structures. Specific
      qualities of autobiographical plans are important predictors of default and
      frontoparietal control network engagement during plan formation and reflect the
      contribution of mnemonic and executive control processes to autobiographical
      planning.

AB  - RATIONALE: Chronic marijuana (MJ) use among adolescents has been associated with 
      structural and functional abnormalities, particularly in developing regions
      responsible for higher order cognition. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated
      prefrontal (PFC) and parietal volumes and executive function in emerging adult MJ
      users and explored potential gender differences. METHODS: Participants (ages
      18-25) were 27 MJ users and 32 controls without neurologic or psychiatric
      disorders or heavy other drug use. A series of multiple regressions examined
      whether group status, past year MJ use, and their interactions with gender
      predicted ROI volumes. Post hoc analyses consisted of brain-behavior correlations
      between volumes and cognitive variables and Fisher's z tests to assess group
      differences. RESULTS: MJ users demonstrated significantly smaller medial
      orbitofrontal (mOFC; p = 0.004, FDR p = 0.024) and inferior parietal volumes (p =
      0.04, FDR p = 0.12); follow-up regressions found that increased past year MJ use 
      did not significantly dose-dependently predict smaller mOFC volume in a
      sub-sample of individuals with at least one past year MJ use. There were no
      significant gender interactions. There was a significant brain-behavior
      difference by group, such that smaller mOFC volumes were associated with poorer
      complex attention for MJ users (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Smaller mOFC volumes
      among MJ users suggest disruption of typical neurodevelopmental processes
      associated with regular MJ use for both genders. These results highlight the need
      for longitudinal, multi-modal imaging studies providing clearer information on
      timing of neurodevelopmental processes and neurocognitive impacts of youth MJ
      initiation.

TI  - The Association Between Implicit Alcohol Attitudes and Drinking Behavior is
      Moderated by Baseline Activation in the Lateral Prefrontal Cortex.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intense alcohol consumption is a risk factor for a number of health
      problems. Dual-process models assume that self-regulatory behavior such as
      drinking alcohol is guided by both reflective and impulsive processes. Evidence
      suggests that (a) impulsive processes such as implicit attitudes are more
      strongly associated with behavior when executive functioning abilities are low,
      and (b) higher neural baseline activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
      is associated with better inhibitory control. The present study integrates these 
      2 strands of research to investigate how individual differences in neural
      baseline activation in the lateral PFC moderate the association between implicit 
      alcohol attitudes and drinking behavior. METHOD: Baseline cortical activation was
      measured with resting electroencephalography (EEG) in 89 moderate drinkers. In a 
      subsequent behavioral testing session they completed measures of implicit alcohol
      attitudes and self-reported drinking behavior. RESULTS: Implicit alcohol
      attitudes were related to self-reported alcohol consumption. Most centrally,
      implicit alcohol attitudes were more strongly associated with drinking behavior
      in individuals with low as compared with high baseline activation in the right
      lateral PFC. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are in line with predictions made on the
      basis of dual-process models. They provide further evidence that individual
      differences in neural baseline activation in the right lateral PFC may contribute
      to executive functioning abilities such as inhibitory control. Moreover,
      individuals with strongly positive implicit alcohol attitudes coupled with a low 
      baseline activation in the right lateral PFC may be at greater risk of developing
      unhealthy drinking patterns than others. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Temporal self-regulation theory: a neurobiologically informed model for physical 
      activity behavior.
PG  - 117
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00117 [doi]
AB  - Dominant explanatory models for physical activity behavior are limited by the
      exclusion of several important components, including temporal dynamics,
      ecological forces, and neurobiological factors. The latter may be a critical
      omission, given the relevance of several aspects of cognitive function for the
      self-regulatory processes that are likely required for consistent implementation 
      of physical activity behavior in everyday life. This narrative review introduces 
      temporal self-regulation theory (TST; Hall and Fong, 2007, 2013) as a new
      explanatory model for physical activity behavior. Important features of the model
      include consideration of the default status of the physical activity behavior, as
      well as the disproportionate influence of temporally proximal behavioral
      contingencies. Most importantly, the TST model proposes positive feedback loops
      linking executive function (EF) and the performance of physical activity
      behavior. Specifically, those with relatively stronger executive control (and
      optimized brain structures supporting it, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (PFC)) are able to implement physical activity with more consistency than 
      others, which in turn serves to strengthen the executive control network itself. 
      The TST model has the potential to explain everyday variants of incidental
      physical activity, sport-related excellence via capacity for deliberate practice,
      and variability in the propensity to schedule and implement exercise routines.

TI  - Brain Correlates of Cognitive Remediation in Schizophrenia: Activation Likelihood
      Analysis Shows Preliminary Evidence of Neural Target Engagement.
PG  - 1276-84
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbv025 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive remediation training (CRT) for schizophrenia has been found to improve 
      cognitive functioning and influence neural plasticity. However, with various
      training approaches and mixed findings, the mechanisms driving generalization of 
      cognitive skills from CRT are unclear. In this meta-analysis of extant imaging
      studies examining CRT's effects, we sought to clarify whether varying approaches 
      to CRT suggest common neural changes and whether such mechanisms are restorative 
      or compensatory. We conducted a literature search to identify studies appropriate
      for inclusion in an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. Our
      criteria required studies to consist of training-based interventions designed to 
      improve patients' cognitive or social functioning, including generalization to
      untrained circumstances. Studies were also required to examine changes in pre- vs
      posttraining functional activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging or
      positron emission tomography. The literature search identified 162 articles, 9 of
      which were appropriate for inclusion. ALE analyses comparing pre- and
      posttraining brain activation showed increased activity in the lateral and medial
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), parietal cortex, insula, and the caudate and thalamus.
      Notably, activation associated with CRT in the left PFC and thalamus partially
      overlapped with previous meta-analytically identified areas associated with
      deficits in working memory, executive control, and facial emotion processing in
      schizophrenia. We conclude that CRT interventions from varying theoretic
      modalities elicit plasticity in areas that support cognitive and socioemotional
      processes in this early set of studies. While preliminary, these changes appear
      to be both restorative and compensatory, though thalamocortical areas previously 
      associated with dysfunction may be common sources of plasticity for cognitive
      remediation in schizophrenia.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed the emergence of powerful new tools for assaying the 
      brain and a remarkable acceleration of research focused on the interplay of
      emotion and cognition. This work has begun to yield new insights into fundamental
      questions about the nature of the mind and important clues about the origins of
      mental illness. In particular, this research demonstrates that stress, anxiety,
      and other kinds of emotion can profoundly influence key elements of cognition,
      including selective attention, working memory, and cognitive control. Often, this
      influence persists beyond the duration of transient emotional challenges,
      partially reflecting the slower molecular dynamics of catecholamine and hormonal 
      neurochemistry. In turn, circuits involved in attention, executive control, and
      working memory contribute to the regulation of emotion. The distinction between
      the 'emotional' and the 'cognitive' brain is fuzzy and context-dependent. Indeed,
      there is compelling evidence that brain territories and psychological processes
      commonly associated with cognition, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      and working memory, play a central role in emotion. Furthermore, putatively
      emotional and cognitive regions influence one another via a complex web of
      connections in ways that jointly contribute to adaptive and maladaptive behavior.
      This work demonstrates that emotion and cognition are deeply interwoven in the
      fabric of the brain, suggesting that widely held beliefs about the key
      constituents of 'the emotional brain' and 'the cognitive brain' are fundamentally
      flawed. We conclude by outlining several strategies for enhancing future
      research. Developing a deeper understanding of the emotional-cognitive brain is
      important, not just for understanding the mind but also for elucidating the root 
      causes of its disorders.

AB  - Sleep and sleep disorders are complex and highly variable phenotypes regulated by
      many genes and environment. The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is an
      interesting candidate, being one of the major mammalian enzymes involved in the
      catabolism of catecholamines. The activity of COMT enzyme is genetically
      polymorphic due to a guanine-to-adenine transition at codon 158, resulting in a
      valine (Val) to methionine (Met) substitution. Individuals homozygous for the Val
      allele show higher COMT activity, and lower dopaminergic signaling in prefrontal 
      cortex (PFC) than subjects homozygous for the Met allele. Since COMT has a
      crucial role in metabolising dopamine, it was suggested that the common
      functional polymorphism in the COMT gene impacts on cognitive function related to
      PFC, sleep-wake regulation, and potentially on sleep pathologies. The COMT
      Val158Met polymorphism may predict inter-individual differences in brain
      electroencephalography (EEG) alpha oscillations and recovery processes resulting 
      from partial sleep loss in healthy individuals. The Val158Met polymorphism also
      exerts a sexual dimorphism and has a strong effect on objective daytime
      sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy. Since the COMT enzyme
      inactivates catecholamines, it was hypothesized that the response to stimulant
      drugs differs between COMT genotypes. Modafinil maintained executive functioning 
      performance and vigilant attention throughout sleep deprivation in subjects with 
      Val/Val genotype, but less in those with Met/Met genotype. Also, homozygous
      Met/Met patients with narcolepsy responded to lower doses of modafinil compared
      to Val/Val carriers. We review here the critical role of the common functional
      COMT gene polymorphism, COMT enzyme activity, and the prefrontal dopamine levels 
      in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness in normal subjects, in narcolepsy and 
      other sleep-related disorders, and its impact on the response to
      psychostimulants.

AB  - The present article promotes a formal executive model of frontal functions
      underlying speech production, bringing together hierarchical theories of adaptive
      behavior in the (pre-)frontal cortex (pFC) and psycho- and neurolinguistic
      approaches to spoken language within an information-theoretic framework. Its
      biological plausibility is revealed through two Activation Likelihood Estimation 
      meta-analyses carried out on a total of 41 hemodynamic studies of overt word and 
      continuous speech production respectively. Their principal findings, considered
      in light of neuropsychological evidence and earlier models of speech-related
      frontal functions, support the engagement of a caudal-to-rostral gradient of pFC 
      activity operationalized by the nature and quantity of speech-related information
      conveyed by task-related external cues (i.e., cue codability) on the one hand,
      and the total informational content of generated utterances on the other. In
      particular, overt reading or repetition and picture naming recruit primarily
      caudal motor-premotor regions involved in the sensorimotor and phonological
      aspects of speech; word and sentence generation engage mid- ventro- and
      dorsolateral areas supporting its basic predicative and syntactic functions;
      finally, rostral- and fronto-polar cortices subsume domain-general strategic
      processes of discourse generation for creative speech. These different levels
      interact in a top-down fashion, ranging representationally and temporally from
      the most general and extended to the most specific and immediate. The end-result 
      is an integrative theory of pFC as the main executive component of the language
      cortical network, which supports the existence of areas specialized for speech
      communication and articulation and regions subsuming internal reasoning and
      planning. Prospective avenues of research pertaining to this model's principal
      predictions are discussed.

TI  - Common neural correlates of intertemporal choices and intelligence in
      adolescents.

LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00698 [doi]
AB  - Converging behavioral evidence indicates that temporal discounting, measured by
      intertemporal choice tasks, is inversely related to intelligence. At the neural
      level, the parieto-frontal network is pivotal for complex, higher-order cognitive
      processes. Relatedly, underrecruitment of the pFC during a working memory task
      has been found to be associated with steeper temporal discounting. Furthermore,
      this network has also been shown to be related to the consistency of
      intertemporal choices. Here we report an fMRI study that directly investigated
      the association of neural correlates of intertemporal choice behavior with
      intelligence in an adolescent sample (n = 206; age 13.7-15.5 years). After
      identifying brain regions where the BOLD response during intertemporal choice was
      correlated with individual differences in intelligence, we further tested whether
      BOLD responses in these areas would mediate the associations between
      intelligence, the discounting rate, and choice consistency. We found positive
      correlations between BOLD response in a value-independent decision network (i.e.,
      dorsolateral pFC, precuneus, and occipital areas) and intelligence. Furthermore, 
      BOLD response in a value-dependent decision network (i.e., perigenual ACC,
      inferior frontal gyrus, ventromedial pFC, ventral striatum) was positively
      correlated with intelligence. The mediation analysis revealed that BOLD responses
      in the value-independent network mediated the association between intelligence
      and choice consistency, whereas BOLD responses in the value-dependent network
      mediated the association between intelligence and the discounting rate. In
      summary, our findings provide evidence for common neural correlates of
      intertemporal choice and intelligence, possibly linked by valuation as well as
      executive functions.

AB  - Recent actions can benefit or disrupt our current actions and the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) is thought to play a major role in the regulation of these actions
      before they occur. The left PFC has been associated with overcoming interference 
      from past events in the context of language production and working memory. The
      right PFC, and especially the right IFG, has been associated with preparatory
      inhibition processes. But damage to the right PFC has also been associated with
      impairment in sustaining actions in motor intentional disorders. Moreover,
      bilateral dorsolateral PFC has been associated with the ability to maintain
      task-sets, and improve the performance of current actions based on previous
      experience. However, potential hemispheric asymmetries in anticipatory regulation
      of action have not yet been delineated. In the present study, patients with left 
      (n=7) vs. right (n=6) PFC damage due to stroke and 14 aged- and education-matched
      controls performed a picture naming and a verbal Simon task (participants had to 
      say "right" or "left" depending on the color of the picture while ignoring its
      position). In both tasks, performance depended on the nature of the preceding
      trial, but in different ways. In the naming task, performance decreased if
      previous pictures were from the same rather than from different semantic
      categories (i.e., semantic interference effect). In the Simon task, performance
      was better for both compatible (i.e., response matching the position of the
      stimulus) and incompatible trials when preceded by a trial of the same
      compatibility (i.e. Gratton effect) relative to sequential trials of different
      compatibility. Left PFC patients were selectively impaired in picture naming;
      they had an increased semantic interference effect compared to both right PFC
      patients and aged-matched controls. Conversely, right PFC patients were
      selectively impaired in the Simon task compared to controls or left PFC patients;
      they showed no benefit when sequential trials were compatible (cC vs. iC trials) 
      or a decreased Gratton effect. These results provide evidence for a double
      dissociation between left and right PFC in the anticipatory regulation of action.
      Our results are in agreement with a preponderant role of the left PFC in
      overcoming proactive interference from competing memory representations and
      provide evidence that the right PFC, plays a role in sustaining goal-directed
      actions consistent with clinical data in right PFC patients with motor
      intentional disorders.

AB  - One of the fundamental missions of neuroscience is to explore the input and
      output properties of neuronal networks to reveal their functional significance.
      However, it is technically difficult to examine synaptic inputs into neuronal
      circuits in behaving animals. Here, we conducted current source density (CSD)
      analysis on local field potentials (LFPs) recorded simultaneously using a
      multi-contact electrode in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of a behaving monkey. We
      observed current sink task-dependent spatiotemporal patterns considered to
      reflect the synaptic input to neurons adjacent to the recording site.
      Specifically, the inferior convex current sink in the PFC was dominant during the
      delay period, whereas the current sink was prominent in the principal sulcus
      during the sample cue and test cue periods. Surprisingly, sulcus current sink
      patterns were spatially periodic, which corresponds to the columnar structure
      suggested by previous anatomical studies. The approaches used in the current
      study will help to elucidate how the PFC network performs executive functions
      according to its synaptic input.

      fMRI study.
PG  - 2653-69
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00663 [doi]
AB  - Age-related source memory impairments may be due, at least in part, to deficits
      in executive processes mediated by the PFC at both study and test. Behavioral
      work suggests that providing environmental support at encoding, such as directing
      attention toward item-source associations, may improve source memory and reduce
      age-related deficits in the recruitment of these executive processes. The present
      fMRI study investigated the effects of directed attention and aging on source
      memory encoding and retrieval. At study, participants were shown pictures of
      objects. They were either asked to attend to the objects and their color (source)
      or to their size. At test, participants determined if objects were seen before,
      and if so, whether they were the same color as previously. Behavioral results
      showed that direction of attention improved source memory for both groups;
      however, age-related deficits persisted. fMRI results revealed that, across
      groups, direction of attention facilitated medial temporal lobe-mediated
      contextual binding processes during study and attenuated right PFC postretrieval 
      monitoring effects at test. However, persistent age-related source memory
      deficits may be related to increased recruitment of medial anterior PFC during
      encoding, indicative of self-referential processing, as well as underrecruitment 
      of lateral anterior PFC-mediated relational processes. Taken together, this study
      suggests that, even when supported, older adults may fail to selectively encode
      goal-relevant contextual details supporting source memory performance.

TI  - Executive control processes underlying multi-item working memory.
PG  - 876-83
LID - 10.1038/nn.3702 [doi]
AB  - A dominant view of prefrontal cortex (PFC) function is that it stores
      task-relevant information in working memory. To examine this and determine how it
      applies when multiple pieces of information must be stored, we trained two
      subjects to perform a multi-item color change detection task and recorded
      activity of neurons in PFC. Few neurons encoded the color of the items. Instead, 
      the predominant encoding was spatial: a static signal reflecting the item's
      position and a dynamic signal reflecting the subject's covert attention. These
      findings challenge the notion that PFC stores task-relevant information. Instead,
      we suggest that the contribution of PFC is in controlling the allocation of
      resources to support working memory. In support of this, we found that increased 
      power in the alpha and theta bands of PFC local field potentials, which are
      thought to reflect long-range communication with other brain areas, was
      correlated with more precise color representations.

TI  - Prepuberal stimulation of 5-HT7-R by LP-211 in a rat model of hyper-activity and 
      attention-deficit: permanent effects on attention, brain amino acids and synaptic
      markers in the fronto-striatal interface.
PG  - e83003
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0083003 [doi]
AB  - The cross-talk at the prefronto-striatal interface involves excitatory amino
      acids, different receptors, transducers and modulators. We investigated long-term
      effects of a prepuberal, subchronic 5-HT7-R agonist (LP-211) on adult behaviour, 
      amino acids and synaptic markers in a model for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD). Naples High Excitability rats (NHE) and their Random Bred
      controls (NRB) were daily treated with LP-211 in the 5th and 6th postnatal week. 
      One month after treatment, these rats were tested for indices of activity, non
      selective (NSA), selective spatial attention (SSA) and emotionality. The quantity
      of L-Glutamate (L-Glu), L-Aspartate (L-Asp) and L-Leucine (L-Leu), dopamine
      transporter (DAT), NMDAR1 subunit and CAMKIIalpha, were assessed in prefrontal
      cortex (PFC), dorsal (DS) and ventral striatum (VS), for their role in synaptic
      transmission, neural plasticity and information processing. Prepuberal LP-211 (at
      lower dose) reduced horizontal activity and (at higher dose) increased SSA, only 
      for NHE but not in NRB rats. Prepuberal LP-211 increased, in NHE rats, L-Glu in
      the PFC and L-Asp in the VS (at 0.250 mg/kg dose), whereas (at 0.125 mg/kg dose) 
      it decreased L-Glu and L-Asp in the DS. The L-Glu was decreased, at 0.125 mg/kg, 
      only in the VS of NRB rats. The DAT levels were decreased with the 0.125 mg/kg
      dose (in the PFC), and increased with the 0.250 mg/kg dose (in the VS),
      significantly for NHE rats. The basal NMDAR1 level was higher in the PFC of NHE
      than NRB rats; LP-211 treatment (at 0.125 mg/kg dose) decreased NMDAR1 in the VS 
      of NRB rats. This study represents a starting point about the impact of
      developmental 5-HT7-R activation on neuro-physiology of attentive processes,
      executive functions and their neural substrates.

AB  - Human memory is dynamic and flexible but is also susceptible to distortions
      arising from adaptive as well as pathological processes. Both accurate and false 
      memory formation require executive control that is critically mediated by the
      left prefrontal cortex (PFC). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      enables noninvasive modulation of cortical activity and associated behavior. The 
      present study reports that tDCS applied to the left dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC)
      shaped accuracy of episodic memory via polaritiy-specific modulation of false
      recognition. When applied during encoding of pictures, anodal tDCS increased
      whereas cathodal stimulation reduced the number of false alarms to lure pictures 
      in subsequent recognition memory testing. These data suggest that the enhancement
      of excitability in the dlPFC by anodal tDCS can be associated with blurred detail
      memory. In contrast, activity-reducing cathodal tDCS apparently acted as a noise 
      filter inhibiting the development of imprecise memory traces and reducing the
      false memory rate. Consistently, the largest effect was found in the most active 
      condition (i.e., for stimuli cued to be remembered). This first evidence for a
      polarity-specific, activity-dependent effect of tDCS on false memory opens new
      vistas for the understanding and potential treatment of disturbed memory control.

AB  - Behavioral studies indicate that theory of mind and counterfactual reasoning are 
      strongly related cognitive processes. In a neuroimaging study, we explored the
      common and distinct regions underlying these inference processes. We directly
      compared false belief reasoning (inferring an agent's false belief about an
      object's location or content) and counterfactual reasoning (inferring what the
      object's location or content would be if an agent had acted differently), both in
      contrast with a baseline condition of conditional reasoning (inferring what the
      true location or content of an object is). Results indicate that these three
      types of reasoning about social scenarios are supported by activations in the
      mentalizing network (left temporo-parietal junction and precuneus) and the
      executive control network (bilateral prefrontal cortex [PFC] and right inferior
      parietal lobule). In addition, representing a false belief or counterfactual
      state (both not directly observable in the external world) recruits additional
      activity in the executive control network (left dorsolateral PFC and parietal
      lobe). The results further suggest that counterfactual reasoning is a more
      complex cognitive process than false belief reasoning, showing stronger
      activation of the dorsomedial, left dorsolateral PFC, cerebellum and left
      temporal cortex.

      functional activity of the brain during MT. However, the effects of MT-training
      on neural mechanisms beyond MT-related functions are not known. We investigated
      the effects of 4 weeks of MT-training on regional gray matter volume (rGMV) and
      functional connectivity during rest (resting-FC) in young human adults.
      MT-training was associated with increased rGMV in three prefrontal cortical
      regions (left lateral rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), 
      and left inferior frontal junction), the left posterior parietal cortex, and the 
      left temporal and lateral occipital areas as well as decreased resting-FC between
      the right DLPFC and an anatomical cluster around the ventral anterior cingulate
      cortex (ACC). Our findings suggest that participation in MT-training is as a
      whole associated with task-irrelevant plasticity (i.e., neural changes are not
      limited to certain specific task conditions) in regions and the network that are 
      assumed to play roles in MT as well as diverse higher-order cognitive functions. 
      We could not dissociate the effects of each task component and the diverse
      cognitive processes involved in MT because of the nature of the study, and these 
      remain to be investigated.

AB  - Drug addictions including alcoholism are characterized by degradation of
      executive control over behavior and increased compulsive drug seeking. These
      profound behavioral changes are hypothesized to involve a shift in the regulation
      of behavior from prefrontal cortex to dorsal striatum (DLS). Studies in rodents
      have shown that ethanol disrupts cognitive processes mediated by the prefrontal
      cortex, but the potential effects of chronic ethanol on DLS-mediated cognition
      and learning are much less well understood. Here, we first examined the effects
      of chronic EtOH on DLS neuronal morphology, synaptic plasticity, and
      endocannabinoid-CB1R signaling. We next tested for ethanol-induced changes in
      striatal-related learning and DLS in vivo single-unit activity during learning.
      Mice exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exhibited expansion of
      dendritic material in DLS neurons. Following CIE, DLS endocannabinoid CB1
      receptor signaling was down-regulated, and CB1 receptor-dependent long-term
      depression at DLS synapses was absent. CIE mice showed facilitation of
      DLS-dependent pairwise visual discrimination and reversal learning, relative to
      air-exposed controls. CIE mice were also quicker to extinguish a stimulus-reward 
      instrumental response and faster to reduce Pavlovian approach behavior under an
      omission schedule. In vivo single-unit recording during learning revealed that
      CIE mice had augmented DLS neuronal activity during correct responses.
      Collectively, these findings support a model in which chronic ethanol causes
      neuroadaptations in the DLS that prime for greater DLS control over learning. The
      shift to striatal dominance over behavior may be a critical step in the
      progression of alcoholism.

AB  - Dense amnesia can result from damage to the medial diencephalon in humans and in 
      animals. In humans this damage is diffuse and can include the mediodorsal nuclei 
      of the thalamus. In animal models, lesion studies have confirmed the mediodorsal 
      thalamus (MD) has a role in memory and other cognitive tasks, although the extent
      of deficits is mixed. Anatomical tracing studies confirm at least three different
      subgroupings of the MD: medial, central, and lateral, each differentially
      interconnected to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Moreover, these subgroupings of
      the MD also receive differing inputs from other brain structures, including the
      basal ganglia thus the MD subgroupings form key nodes in interconnected
      frontal-striatal-thalamic neural circuits, integrating critical information
      within the PFC. We will provide a review of data collected from non-human
      primates and rodents after selective brain injury to the whole of the MD as well 
      as these subgroupings to highlight the extent of deficits in various cognitive
      tasks. This research highlights the neural basis of memory and cognitive deficits
      associated with the subgroupings of the MD and their interconnected neural
      networks. The evidence shows that the MD plays a critical role in many varied
      cognitive processes. In addition, the MD is actively processing information and
      integrating it across these neural circuits for successful cognition. Having
      established that the MD is critical for memory and cognition, further research is
      required to understand how the MD specifically influences these cognitive
      processing carried out by the brain.

TI  - Dreaming as mind wandering: evidence from functional neuroimaging and
      first-person content reports.
PG  - 412
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2013.00412 [doi]
AB  - Isolated reports have long suggested a similarity in content and thought
      processes across mind wandering (MW) during waking, and dream mentation during
      sleep. This overlap has encouraged speculation that both "daydreaming" and
      dreaming may engage similar brain mechanisms. To explore this possibility, we
      systematically examined published first-person experiential reports of MW and
      dreaming and found many similarities: in both states, content is largely
      audiovisual and emotional, follows loose narratives tinged with fantasy, is
      strongly related to current concerns, draws on long-term memory, and simulates
      social interactions. Both states are also characterized by a relative lack of
      meta-awareness. To relate first-person reports to neural evidence, we compared
      meta-analytic data from numerous functional neuroimaging (PET, fMRI) studies of
      the default mode network (DMN, with high chances of MW) and rapid eye movement
      (REM) sleep (with high chances of dreaming). Our findings show large overlaps in 
      activation patterns of cortical regions: similar to MW/DMN activity, dreaming and
      REM sleep activate regions implicated in self-referential thought and memory,
      including medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), medial temporal lobe structures, and
      posterior cingulate. Conversely, in REM sleep numerous PFC executive regions are 
      deactivated, even beyond levels seen during waking MW. We argue that dreaming can
      be understood as an "intensified" version of waking MW: though the two share many
      similarities, dreams tend to be longer, more visual and immersive, and to more
      strongly recruit numerous key hubs of the DMN. Further, whereas MW recruits fewer
      PFC regions than goal-directed thought, dreaming appears to be characterized by
      an even deeper quiescence of PFC regions involved in cognitive control and
      metacognition, with a corresponding lack of insight and meta-awareness. We
      suggest, then, that dreaming amplifies the same features that distinguish MW from
      goal-directed waking thought.

AB  - Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to reduce acute
      substance craving in drug addicts, and improve cognition in neuropsychiatric
      patients. Here we aimed to explore further tDCS induced behavioral and
      neurophysiological modulation including assessment of relapse rate over a
      prolonged time course in alcoholism. We examined the effects of repeated anodal
      tDCS (2mA, 35 cm(2), 20min) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 
      on relapse to the use of alcohol in alcoholics from outpatient services, who
      received additional routine clinical treatment. Furthermore, event related
      potentials (ERPs), cognitive and frontal executive processes, craving, depressive
      and anxiety symptoms were obtained before and after treatment. From thirteen
      alcoholic subjects, seven were randomized to sham-tDCS and six to real tDCS
      treatment (once a week for five consecutive weeks). Depressive symptoms and
      craving were reduced to a larger extent in the tDCS group compared to the sham
      group (p=0.005 and p=0.015, respectively). On the other hand, active tDCS was
      able to block the increase in neural activation triggered by alcohol related and 
      neutral cues in prefrontal cortex (PFC) as indexed by ERP as seen in the
      sham-tDCS group. Finally, there was a trend for increased change in executive
      function in the tDCS group compared to the sham-tDCS group (p=0.082), and,
      similarly, a trend for more relapses in the tDCS group compared to sham tDCS
      (four alcoholic subjects (66.7%) vs. one (14.3%), p=0.053).These results confirm 
      the previous findings of tDCS effects on craving in alcoholism and also extend
      these findings as we showed also tDCS-related mood improvement. However,
      potential increase in relapse is possible; thus the clinical value of an increase
      in craving and improvement in depression and executive function needs to be
      carefully assessed in further studies; including investigation of optimal
      parameters of stimulation.

AB  - Semantic cognition requires a combination of semantic representations and
      executive control processes to direct activation in a task- and time-appropriate 
      fashion [Jefferies, E., & Lambon Ralph, M. A. Semantic impairment in stroke
      aphasia versus semantic dementia: A case-series comparison. Brain, 129,
      2132-2147, 2006]. We undertook a formal meta-analysis to investigate which
      regions within the large-scale semantic network are specifically associated with 
      the executive component of semantic cognition. Previous studies have described in
      detail the role of left ventral pFC in semantic regulation. We examined 53
      studies that contrasted semantic tasks with high > low executive requirements to 
      determine whether cortical regions beyond the left pFC show the same response
      profile to executive semantic demands. Our findings revealed that right pFC,
      posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) and dorsal angular gyrus (bordering
      intraparietal sulcus) were also consistently recruited by executively demanding
      semantic tasks, demonstrating patterns of activation that were highly similar to 
      the left ventral pFC. These regions overlap with the lesions in aphasic patients 
      who exhibit multimodal semantic impairment because of impaired regulatory control
      (semantic aphasia)-providing important convergence between functional
      neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies of semantic cognition. Activation in 
      dorsal angular gyrus and left ventral pFC was consistent across all types of
      executive semantic manipulation, regardless of whether the task was receptive or 
      expressive, whereas pMTG activation was only observed for manipulation of control
      demands within receptive tasks. Second, we contrasted executively demanding tasks
      tapping semantics and phonology. Our findings revealed substantial overlap
      between the two sets of contrasts within left ventral pFC, suggesting this region
      underpins domain-general control mechanisms. In contrast, we observed relative
      specialization for semantic control within pMTG as well as the most ventral
      aspects of left pFC (BA 47), consistent with our proposal of a distributed
      network underpinning semantic control.

AB  - In many circumstances alternative courses of action and thoughts have to be
      inhibited to allow the emergence of goal-directed behavior. However, this has not
      been the accepted view in the past and only recently has inhibition earned its
      own place in the neurosciences as a fundamental cognitive function. In this
      review we first introduce the concept of inhibition from early psychological
      speculations based on philosophical theories of the human mind. The broad
      construct of inhibition is then reduced to its most readily observable component 
      which necessarily is its behavioral manifestation. The study of 'response
      inhibition' has the advantage of dealing with a relatively simple and
      straightforward process, the overriding of a planned or already initiated action.
      Deficient inhibitory processes profoundly affect everyday life, causing impulsive
      conduct which is generally detrimental for the individual. Impulsivity has been
      consistently linked to several types of addiction, attention
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mania and other psychiatric conditions. Our
      discussion of the behavioral assessment of impulsivity will focus on objective
      laboratory tasks of response inhibition that have been implemented in parallel
      for humans and other species with relatively few qualitative differences. The
      translational potential of these measures has greatly improved our knowledge of
      the neurobiological basis of behavioral inhibition and impulsivity. We will then 
      review the current models of behavioral inhibition along with their expression
      via underlying brain regions, including those involved in the activation of the
      brain's emergency 'brake' operation, those engaged in more controlled and
      sustained inhibitory processes and other ancillary executive functions.

AB  - Heroin abuse and natural aging exert common influences on immunological cell
      functioning. This observation led to a recent and untested idea that aging may be
      accelerated in abusers of heroin. We examined this claim by testing whether
      heroin use is associated with premature aging at both cellular and brain system
      levels. A group of abstinent heroin users (n=33) and matched healthy controls
      (n=30) were recruited and measured on various biological indicators of aging.
      These measures included peripheral blood telomerase activity, which reflects
      cellular aging, and both structural and functional measures of brain magnetic
      resonance imaging. We found that heroin users were characterized by significantly
      low telomerase activity (0.21 vs 1.78; 88% reduction; t(61)=6.96, P<0.001; 95%
      confidence interval=1.12-2.02), which interacted with heroin use to affect the
      structural integrity of gray and white matter of the prefrontal cortex (PFC;
      AlphaSim corrected P<0.05), a key brain region implicated in aging. Using the PFC
      location identified from the structural analyses as a 'seed' region, it was
      further revealed that telomerase activity interacted with heroin use to impact
      age-sensitive brain functional networks (AlphaSim corrected P<0.05), which
      correlated with behavioral performance on executive functioning, memory and
      attentional control (Pearson correlation, all P<0.05). To our knowledge, this
      study is the first to attempt a direct integration of peripheral molecular, brain
      system and behavioral measures in the context of substance abuse. The present
      finding that heroin abuse is associated with accelerated aging at both cellular
      and brain system levels is novel and forms a unique contribution to our knowledge
      in how the biological processes of drug abusers may be disrupted.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is responsible for integrating cortical and
      subcortical inputs to execute essential cognitive functions such as attention,
      working memory planning and decision-making. The importance of this brain region 
      in regulating complex cognitive processes is underscored by a decline in
      PFC-mediated ability observed in aging and disease. The cholinergic system plays 
      a vital role in cognitive function and treatments (e.g., cholinesterase
      inhibitors) to improve cholinergic neurotransmission provide the standard-of-care
      for diseases such as Alzheimer's. Nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) are a primary site
      of action for acetylcholine (ACh), and the resulting pro-cognitive effects
      observed by stimulating nAChRs with nicotine has long been appreciated by tobacco
      users, prompting investigation of therapeutic development for diseases (e.g.,
      schizophrenia, Alzheimer or attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder) by
      targeting the neuronal nAChR system. Noteworthy, improvements in attention,
      working memory and executive processes mediated by the PFC have been reported
      following nicotinic agonist exposure. Relevance of these ligand gated channels in
      higher brain function is further supported by the association of cognitive
      deficits reported in humans with mutations in CHRNB2 or CHRNA7 the genes encoding
      for the nicotinic receptor beta2 and alpha7 subunits, respectively. In this work 
      we review, in light of the latest findings, how nicotinic agonists may be acting 
      in the PFC to influence cognitive function.

AB  - The mechanisms and neural circuits that drive emotion and cognition are
      inextricably linked. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
      as a result of stress or other causes of arousal initiates a flood of hormone and
      neurotransmitter release throughout the brain, affecting the way we think,
      decide, and behave. This review will focus on factors that influence the function
      of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region that governs higher-level
      cognitive processes and executive function. The PFC becomes markedly impaired by 
      stress, producing measurable deficits in working memory. These deficits arise
      from the interaction of multiple neuromodulators, including glucocorticoids,
      catecholamines, and gonadal hormones; here we will discuss the non-human primate 
      and rodent literature that has furthered our understanding of the circuitry,
      receptors, and signaling cascades responsible for stress-induced prefrontal
      dysfunction.

TI  - Prefrontal cortex organization: dissociating effects of temporal abstraction,
      relational abstraction, and integration with FMRI.
PG  - 2377-87
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bht091 [doi]
AB  - The functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) underlie higher-level cognition.
      Varying proposals suggest that the PFC is organized along a rostral-caudal
      gradient of abstraction with more abstract representations/processes associated
      with more rostral areas. However, the operational definition of abstraction is
      unclear. Here, we contrasted 2 prominent theories of abstraction--temporal and
      relational--using fMRI. We further examined whether integrating abstract rules--a
      function common to each theory--recruited the PFC independently of other
      abstraction effects. While robust effects of relational abstraction were present 
      in the PFC, temporal abstraction effects were absent. Instead, we found
      activations specific to the integration of relational rules in areas previously
      shown to be associated with temporal abstraction. We suggest that previous
      effects of temporal abstraction were due to confounds with integration demands.
      We propose an integration framework to understand the functions of the PFC that
      resolves discrepancies in prior data.

TI  - Affective and executive network processing associated with persuasive antidrug
      messages.
PG  - 1136-47
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00391 [doi]
AB  - Previous research has highlighted brain regions associated with socioemotional
      processes in persuasive message encoding, whereas cognitive models of persuasion 
      suggest that executive brain areas may also be important. The current study aimed
      to identify lateral prefrontal brain areas associated with persuasive message
      viewing and understand how activity in these executive regions might interact
      with activity in the amygdala and medial pFC. Seventy adolescents were scanned
      using fMRI while they watched 10 strongly convincing antidrug public service
      announcements (PSAs), 10 weakly convincing antidrug PSAs, and 10 advertisements
      (ads) unrelated to drugs. Antidrug PSAs compared with nondrug ads more strongly
      elicited arousal-related activity in the amygdala and medial pFC. Within antidrug
      PSAs, those that were prerated as strongly persuasive versus weakly persuasive
      showed significant differences in arousal-related activity in executive
      processing areas of the lateral pFC. In support of the notion that persuasiveness
      involves both affective and executive processes, functional connectivity analyses
      showed greater coactivation between the lateral pFC and amygdala during PSAs
      known to be strongly (vs. weakly) convincing. These findings demonstrate that
      persuasive messages elicit activation in brain regions responsible for both
      emotional arousal and executive control and represent a crucial step toward a
      better understanding of the neural processes responsible for persuasion and
      subsequent behavior change.

TI  - The roles of reward, default, and executive control networks in set-shifting
      impairments in schizophrenia.
PG  - e57257
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0057257 [doi]
AB  - Patients with schizophrenia (SZ) show deficits on tasks of rapid reinforcement
      learning, like probabilistic reversal learning (PRL), but the neural bases for
      those impairments are not known. Recent evidence of relatively intact sensitivity
      to negative outcomes in the ventral striatum (VS) in many SZ patients suggests
      that PRL deficits may be largely attributable to processes downstream from
      feedback processing, involving both the activation of executive control task
      regions and deactivation of default mode network (DMN) components. We analyzed
      data from 29 chronic SZ patients and 21 matched normal controls (NCs) performing 
      a PRL task in an MRI scanner. Subjects were presented with eight pairs of fractal
      stimuli, for 50 trials each. For each pair, subjects learned to choose the more
      frequently-rewarded (better) stimulus. Each time a criterion was reached, the
      better stimulus became the worse one, and the worse became the better. Responses 
      to feedback events were assessed through whole-brain and regions-of-interest
      (ROI) analyses in DMN. We also assessed correlations between BOLD signal
      contrasts and clinical measures in SZs. Relative to NCs, SZ patients showed
      comparable deactivation of VS in response to negative feedback, but reduced
      deactivation of DMN components including medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The
      magnitudes of patients' punishment-evoked deactivations in VS and ventromedial
      PFC correlated significantly with clinical ratings for avolition/anhedonia. These
      findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to
      deactivate components of default mode networks, following the presentation of
      informative feedback and that motivational deficits in SZ relate closely to
      feedback-evoked activity in reward circuit components. These results also confirm
      a role for ventrolateral and dorsomedial PFC in the execution of response-set

AB  - While the hippocampal formation and the prefrontal cortex each have a
      well-established role in cognitive and mnemonic processes, the extent and manner 
      in which these structures interact to achieve these functions has not been fully 
      delineated. Recent research in rodents compellingly supports the idea that the
      projection of neurons extending from the CA1 region of the hippocampus and from
      the subiculum to the prefrontal cortex, referred to here as the H-PFC pathway, is
      critically involved in aspects of cognition related to executive function and to 
      emotional regulation. Concurrently, it is becoming evident that persons suffering
      from schizophrenia, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder display
      structural anomalies and aberrant functional coupling within the
      hippocampal-prefrontal circuit. Considering that these disorders involve varying 
      degrees of cognitive impairment and emotional dysregulation, dysfunction in the
      H-PFC pathway might therefore be the common element of their pathophysiology.
      This overlap might also be intertwined with the pathway's evident susceptibility 
      to stress and with its relationship to the amygdala. In consequence, the H-PFC
      pathway is a potentially crucial element of the pathophysiology of several
      psychiatric diseases, and it offers a specific target for therapeutic
      intervention, which is consistent with the recent emphasis on reframing
      psychiatric diseases in terms of brain circuits.

AB  - The pFC has a crucial role in cognitive control, executive function, and sensory 
      processing. Functional imaging, neurophysiological, and animal studies provide
      evidence for a functional connectivity between the dorsolateral pFC (DLPFC) and
      the primary motor cortex (M1) during free choice but not instructed choice
      selection tasks. In this study, twin coil, neuronavigated TMS was used to examine
      the precise timing of the functional interaction between human left DLPFC and
      ipsilateral M1 during the execution of a free/specified choice selection task
      involving the digits of the right hand. In a thumb muscle that was not involved
      in the task, a conditioning pulse to the left DLPFC enhanced the excitability of 
      the ipsilateral M1 during free selection more than specified selection 100 msec
      after presentation of the cue; the opposite effect was seen at 75 msec. However, 
      the difference between free and externally specified conditions disappeared when 
      a task-specific muscle was investigated. In this case, the influence from DLPFC
      was dominated by task involvement rather than mode of selection, suggesting that 
      other processes related to movement execution were also operating. Finally, we
      show that the effects were spatially specific because they were absent when an
      adjacent area of DLPFC was stimulated. These results reveal temporally and
      spatially selective interactions between BA 46 and M1 that are both task and
      muscle specific.

TI  - Inhibition of dopamine transporter activity impairs synaptic depression in rat
      prefrontal cortex through over-stimulation of D1 receptors.
PG  - 945-55
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhs376 [doi]
AB  - In rat prefrontal cortex (PFC), long-term depression induced by low-frequency
      single stimuli has never been studied. Combined with the well-documented
      involvement of dopamine transporters (DATs) in the regulation of PFC-dependent
      cognitive processes, it is important to test whether this form of plasticity can 
      be modulated by DAT activity in the PFC. Here, we show first that prolonged 3-Hz 
      stimuli successfully induced synaptic depression in rat PFC slices whose
      induction depended on endogenous stimulation of D1-like and D2-like receptors and
      the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). This
      depression was found to be significantly impaired by selective inhibition of the 
      DAT by GBR12909 (1-200 nM) or GBR12935 (100 nM). The excess amount of
      extracellular dopamine caused by DAT inhibition acted critically on D1-like
      receptors to impair depression. Furthermore, this impairment by GBR12 909 was
      cancelled by the allosteric-positive mGluR5 modulator CDPPB, the drug known to
      reverse hyperdopaminergia-induced abnormal PFC activity, and the associated
      cognitive disturbances. Finally, these induction, impairment, and restoration of 
      synaptic depression were correlated by an inverted-U shape manner with the
      phosphorylation level of ERK1/2. We suggest that abnormal increases of the
      extracellular dopamine level by DAT inhibition impair synaptic depression in the 
      PFC through over-stimulation of D1-like receptors.

AB  - Executive function encompasses a range of control processes supporting flexible, 
      goal-directed behaviour. Attentional set-shifting, updating of information in
      working memory, and inhibitory control have been proposed as key components of
      executive function, but debate continues as to the validity of this conceptual
      framework, and the neural substrates of these putative components. Here we
      examined prefrontal structure-function relationships for each of these component 
      processes in a large cohort of patients with focal prefrontal damage. Forty-five 
      patients with focal damage to various sectors of prefrontal cortex (PFC), and 50 
      demographically matched healthy control subjects performed an attention shifting 
      task, the Stroop colour naming task, and a spatial search task. Voxel-based
      lesion-symptom mapping revealed that damage to left ventrolateral PFC led to
      impaired performance on both the Stroop and attention shifting tasks. In
      contrast, performance of the spatial search task depended on several regions
      within PFC, but notably not left ventrolateral PFC. These observations were
      confirmed with direct comparison of performance between patients grouped
      according to lesion location. This dissociation partly supports the component
      process view of executive function, distinguishing the goal-directed regulation
      of attention (perhaps specifically in the verbal domain) from the requirements of
      the spatial search task, including the updating of information in spatial working
      memory. These findings are easier to reconcile with modular, material-specific
      accounts than with more unitary models of executive function.

TI  - Closing the loop in primate prefrontal cortex: inter-laminar processing.
PG  - 88
LID - 10.3389/fncir.2012.00088 [doi]
AB  - Prefrontal cortical (PFC) activity in the primate brain emerging from
      minicolumnar microcircuits plays a critical role in cognitive processes dealing
      with executive control of behavior. However, the specific operations of columnar 
      laminar processing in prefrontal cortex (PFC) are not completely understood. Here
      we show via implementation of unique microanatomical recording and stimulating
      arrays, that minicolumns in PFC are involved in the executive control of behavior
      in rhesus macaque nonhuman primates (NHPs) performing a delayed-match-to-sample
      (DMS) task. PFC neurons demonstrate functional interactions between pairs of
      putative pyramidal cells within specified cortical layers via anatomically
      oriented minicolumns. Results reveal target-specific, spatially tuned firing
      between inter-laminar (layer 2/3 and layer 5) pairs of neurons participating in
      the gating of information during the decision making phase of the task with
      differential correlations between activity in layer 2/3 and layer 5 in the
      integration of spatial vs. object-specific information for correct task
      performance. Such inter-laminar processing was exploited by the interfacing of an
      online model which delivered stimulation to layer 5 locations in a pattern
      associated with successful performance thereby closing the columnar loop
      externally in a manner that mimicked normal processing in the same task. These
      unique technologies demonstrate that PFC neurons encode and process information
      via minicolumns which provides a closed loop form of "executive function," hence 
      disruption of such inter-laminar processing could form the bases for cognitive
      dysfunction in primate brain.

TI  - Complementary roles of medial temporal lobes and mid-dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex for working memory for novel and familiar trial-unique visual stimuli.
PG  - 668-78
LID - 10.1111/ejn.12062 [doi]
AB  - It has been suggested that working memory (WM) for novel information requires the
      medial temporal lobes (MTL), but is not necessary for WM for familiar stimuli. In
      previous studies that directly compared WM for novel and familiar stimuli, only
      the novel stimuli were trial-unique. Here, 16 young human subjects performed a
      Sternberg WM task with visual scenes while in a functional magnetic resonance
      imaging scanner. All task stimuli were trial-unique, but were either new (Novel
      condition) or previously learned (Familiar condition). This design allowed
      investigation of whether MTL and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity is related
      specifically to the novelty/familiarity of the stimuli or to their trial-unique
      status during WM. We observed greater hippocampal and parahippocampal activity
      during encoding and maintenance for novel than for familiar stimuli. In contrast,
      right mid-dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) activity was greater during encoding of
      familiar than novel stimuli. The mid-dlPFC was not recruited during maintenance
      or for retrieval when the Familiar condition was contrasted with the Novel
      condition. However, left mid-dlPFC activity was present at retrieval when correct
      Match trials (i.e. hits) were contrasted with correct Non-match trials (i.e.
      correct rejections) for the Novel condition. The results support the hypothesis
      that MTL regions are required for the encoding and maintenance of novel stimuli
      during WM, demonstrating that the observed MTL activity is not related to the
      trial-uniqueness of the stimuli per se. Furthermore, the observed activation
      pattern in mid-dlPFC suggests a role for the mid-dlPFC in executive
      control-associated processes related to monitoring of scene familiarity at
      encoding and retrieval during WM.

AB  - Executive functions supported by prefrontal cortical (PFC) systems provide
      essential control and planning mechanisms to guide goal-directed behavior. As
      such, age-related alterations in executive functions can mediate profound and
      widespread deficits on a diverse array of neurocognitive processes. Many of the
      critical neuroanatomical and functional characteristics of prefrontal cortex are 
      preserved in rodents, allowing for meaningful cross species comparisons relevant 
      to the study of cognitive aging. In particular, as rodents lend themselves to
      genetic, cellular and biochemical approaches, rodent models of executive function
      stand to significantly contribute to our understanding of the critical
      neurobiological mechanisms that mediate decline of executive processes across the
      lifespan. Moreover, rodent analogs of executive functions that decline in human
      aging represent an essential component of a targeted, rational approach for
      developing and testing effective treatment and prevention therapies for
      age-related cognitive decline. This paper reviews behavioral approaches used to
      study executive function in rodents, with a focus on those assays that share a
      foundation in the psychological and neuroanatomical constructs important for
      human aging. A particular emphasis is placed on behavioral approaches used to
      assess working memory and cognitive flexibility, which are sensitive to decline
      with age across species and for which strong rodent models currently exist. In
      addition, other approaches in rodent behavior that have potential for providing
      analogs to functions that reliably decline to human aging (e.g., information
      processing speed) are discussed.

LID - 10.1155/2012/624795 [doi]
AB  - Age-related cognitive impairments often include difficulty retrieving memories,
      particularly those that rely on executive control. In this paper we discuss the
      influence of the prefrontal cortex on memory retrieval, and the specific memory
      processes associated with the prefrontal cortex that decline in late adulthood.
      We conclude that preretrieval processes associated with preparation to make a
      memory judgment are impaired, leading to greater reliance on postretrieval
      processes. This is consistent with the view that impairments in executive control
      significantly contribute to deficits in controlled retrieval. Finally, we discuss
      age-related changes in sleep as a potential mechanism that contributes to
      deficiencies in executive control that are important for efficient retrieval. The
      sleep literature points to the importance of slow-wave sleep in restoration of
      prefrontal cortex function. Given that slow-wave sleep significantly declines
      with age, we hypothesize that age-related changes in slow-wave sleep could
      mediate age-related decline in executive control, manifesting a robust deficit in
      controlled memory retrieval processes. Interventions, like physical activity,
      that improve sleep could be effective methods to enhance controlled memory
      processes in late life.

AB  - A large number of studies in both humans and experimental animals have
      demonstrated nicotine-induced improvements in various aspects of cognitive
      function, including attention and memory. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought 
      to be critically involved in the modulation of executive function and these
      attentional processes are enhanced by nicotine acting at nicotinic acetylcholine 
      receptors. The involvement of nicotinic processes on cognitive flexibility in
      particular has not been specifically investigated. The effects of nicotine on
      attentional flexibility were therefore evaluated using the rodent attentional set
      shifting task in rats. Nicotine injected both acutely and following repeated
      pre-exposure significantly improved both intradimensional and extradimensional
      set shifting performance in the task. Further investigation of the acute effects 
      of nicotine demonstrated this improvement in attentional flexibility to be
      dose-dependent. These results implicate the nicotinic receptor system in the
      mediation of processes underlying cognitive flexibility and suggest that nicotine
      improves attentional flexibility in rats, both within and between perceptual
      dimensions of a compound stimulus. Nicotine-induced alterations in prefrontal
      circuitry may underlie these effects on cognitive flexibility. This article is
      part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.

TI  - Recall deficits in stroke patients with thalamic lesions covary with damage to
      the parvocellular mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus.
PG  - 2477-91
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.06.019 [doi]
AB  - The functional role of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) and its cortical
      network in memory processes is discussed controversially. While Aggleton and
      Brown (1999) suggested a role for recognition and not recall, Van der Werf et al.
      (2003) suggested that this nucleus is functionally related to executive function 
      and strategic retrieval, based on its connections to the prefrontal cortices
      (PFC). The present study used a lesion approach including patients with focal
      thalamic lesions to examine the functions of the MD, the intralaminar nuclei and 
      the midline nuclei in memory processing. A newly designed pair association task
      was used, which allowed the assessment of recognition and cued recall
      performance. Volume loss in thalamic nuclei was estimated as a predictor for
      alterations in memory performance. Patients performed poorer than healthy
      controls on recognition accuracy and cued recall. Furthermore, patients responded
      slower than controls specifically on recognition trials followed by successful
      cued recall of the paired associate. Reduced recall of picture pairs and
      increased response times during recognition followed by cued recall covaried with
      the volume loss in the parvocellular MD. This pattern suggests a role of this
      thalamic region in recall and thus recollection, which does not fit the framework
      proposed by Aggleton and Brown (1999). The functional specialization of the
      parvocellular MD accords with its connectivity to the dorsolateral PFC,
      highlighting the role of this thalamocortical network in explicit memory (Van der
      Werf et al., 2003).

TI  - Patients with Schizophrenia Fail to Up-Regulate Task-Positive and Down-Regulate
      Task-Negative Brain Networks: An fMRI Study Using an ICA Analysis Approach.
PG  - 149
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00149 [doi]
AB  - Recent research suggests that the cerebral correlates of cognitive deficits in
      schizophrenia are nested in the activity of widespread, inter-regional networks
      rather than being restricted to any specific brain location. One of the networks 
      that have received focus lately is the default mode network. Parts of this
      network have been reported as hyper-activated in schizophrenia patients (SZ)
      during rest and during task performance compared to healthy controls (HC),
      although other parts have been found to be hypo-activated. In contrast to this
      network, task-positive networks have been reported as hypo-activated compared in 
      SZ during task performance. However, the results are mixed, with, e.g., the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showing both hyper- and hypo-activation in SZ. In 
      this study we were interested in signal increase and decrease differences between
      a group of SZ and HC in cortical networks, assuming that the regulatory dynamics 
      of alternating task-positive and task-negative neuronal processes are aberrant in
      SZ. We compared 31 SZ to age- and gender-matched HC, and used fMRI and
      independent component analysis (ICA) in order to identify relevant networks. We
      selected the independent components (ICs) with the largest signal intensity
      increases (STG, insula, supplementary motor cortex, anterior cingulate cortex,
      and MTG) and decreases (fusiform gyri, occipital lobe, PFC, cingulate, precuneus,
      and angular gyrus) in response to a dichotic auditory cognitive task. These ICs
      were then tested for group differences. Our findings showed deficient
      up-regulation of the executive network and a corresponding deficit in the
      down-regulation of the anterior default mode, or effort network during task
      performance in SZ when compared with HC. These findings may indicate a deficit in
      the dynamics of alternating task-dependent and task-independent neuronal
      processes in SZ. The results may cast new light on the mechanisms underlying
      cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, and may be of relevance for diagnostics and 
      new treatments.

      screening test: an fMRI approach.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.1186/1744-9081-8-26 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Kana Pick-out Test (KPT), which uses Kana or Japanese symbols
      that represent syllables, requires parallel processing of discrete (pick-out) and
      continuous (reading) dual tasks. As a dual task, the KPT is thought to test
      working memory and executive function, particularly in the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC), and is widely used in Japan as a clinical screen for dementia.
      Nevertheless, there has been little neurological investigation into PFC activity 
      during this test. METHODS: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      to evaluate changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in
      young healthy adults during performance of a computerized KPT dual task
      (comprised of reading comprehension and picking out vowels) and compared it to
      its single task components (reading or vowel pick-out alone). RESULTS: Behavioral
      performance of the KPT degraded compared to its single task components.
      Performance of the KPT markedly increased BOLD signal intensity in the PFC, and
      also activated sensorimotor, parietal association, and visual cortex areas. In
      conjunction analyses, bilateral BOLD signal in the dorsolateral PFC (Brodmann's
      areas 45, 46) was present only in the KPT. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the
      central bottleneck theory and suggest that the dorsolateral PFC is an important
      mediator of neural activity for both short-term storage and executive processes. 
      Quantitative evaluation of the KPT with fMRI in healthy adults is the first step 
      towards understanding the effects of aging or cognitive impairment on KPT
      performance.

AB  - In our daily life, we often adapt plans and behaviors according to dynamically
      changing world circumstances, selecting activities that make us feel more
      confident about the future. In this adaptation, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is
      believed to have an important role, applying executive control on other cognitive
      processes to achieve context switching and confidence monitoring; however, many
      questions remain open regarding the nature of neural processes supporting
      executive control. The current work explores possible mechanisms of this
      high-order cognitive function, transferring executing control in the domain of
      artificial cognitive systems. In particular, we study the self-organization of
      artificial neural networks accomplishing a robotic rule-switching task analogous 
      to the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The obtained results show that behavioral
      rules may be encoded in neuro-dynamic attractors, with their geometric
      arrangements in phase space affecting the shaping of confidence. Analysis of the 
      emergent dynamical structures suggests possible explanations of the interactions 
      of high-level and low-level processes in the real brain.

TI  - Effects of semantic relatedness on age-related associative memory deficits: the
      role of theta oscillations.
PG  - 1235-48
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.03.034 [doi]
AB  - Growing evidence suggests that age-related deficits in associative memory are
      alleviated when the to-be-associated items are semantically related. Here we
      investigate whether this beneficial effect of semantic relatedness is paralleled 
      by spatio-temporal changes in cortical EEG dynamics during incidental encoding.
      Young and older adults were presented with faces at a particular spatial location
      preceded by a biographical cue that was either semantically related or unrelated.
      As expected, automatic encoding of face-location associations benefited from
      semantic relatedness in the two groups of age. This effect correlated with
      increased power of theta oscillations over medial and anterior lateral regions of
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and lateral regions of the posterior parietal cortex 
      (PPC) in both groups. But better-performing elders also showed increased
      brain-behavior correlation in the theta band over the right inferior frontal
      gyrus (IFG) as compared to young adults. Semantic relatedness was, however,
      insufficient to fully eliminate age-related differences in associative memory. In
      line with this finding, poorer-performing elders relative to young adults showed 
      significant reductions of theta power in the left IFG that were further
      predictive of behavioral impairment in the recognition task. All together, these 
      results suggest that older adults benefit less than young adults from executive
      processes during encoding mainly due to neural inefficiency over regions of the
      left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). But this associative deficit may be
      partially compensated for by engaging preexistent semantic knowledge, which
      likely leads to an efficient recruitment of attentional and integration processes
      supported by the left PPC and left anterior PFC respectively, together with
      neural compensatory mechanisms governed by the right VLPFC.

      reward gene polymorphisms constitute a diagnostic tool to identify individuals at
      risk for impaired judgment?
PG  - 298-313
LID - 10.1007/s12035-012-8247-z [doi]
AB  - Executive functions are processes that act in harmony to control behaviors
      necessary for maintaining focus and achieving outcomes. Executive dysfunction in 
      neuropsychiatric disorders is attributed to structural or functional pathology of
      brain networks involving prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its connections with other
      brain regions. The PFC receives innervations from different neurons associated
      with a number of neurotransmitters, especially dopamine (DA). Here we review
      findings on the contribution of PFC DA to higher-order cognitive and emotional
      behaviors. We suggest that examination of multifactorial interactions of an
      individual's genetic history, along with environmental risk factors, can assist
      in the characterization of executive functioning for that individual. Based upon 
      the results of genetic studies, we also propose genetic mapping as a probable
      diagnostic tool serving as a therapeutic adjunct for augmenting executive
      functioning capabilities. We conclude that preservation of the neurological
      underpinnings of executive functions requires the integrity of complex neural
      systems including the influence of specific genes and associated polymorphisms to
      provide adequate neurotransmission.

PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1007/s00213-011-2596-6 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: The prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediates executive functions, a set of
      control processes that optimize performance on cognitive tasks. It enables
      appropriate decision-making and mediates adapted behaviors, all processes
      impaired in psychiatric or degenerative disorders. Key players of normal
      functioning of the PFC are neurotransmitter (NT) systems arising from subcortical
      nuclei and targeting PFC subareas and, also, neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine
      receptors (nAChRs). These ion channels, located on multiple cell compartments in 
      all brain areas, mediate direct cholinergic transmission and modulate the release
      of NTs that cross onto PFC neurons or interneurons. OBJECTIVE: We compiled
      current knowledge concerning the role of nAChRs in NT release, focusing on the
      PFC. We point out plausible mechanisms of interaction among PFC circuits
      implicated in executive functions and emphasized the role of beta2-containing
      nAChRs, the high-affinity receptors for acetylcholine (ACh). These receptors are 
      more directly implicated in behavioral flexibility either when located on PFC
      neurons or in the monoaminergic or cholinergic systems targeting the PFC.
      RESULTS: We shed light on potentially crucial roles played by nAChRs in complex
      interactions between local and afferent NTs. We show how they could act on
      cognition via PFC networks. CONCLUSIONS: nAChRs are crucial for decision-making, 
      during integration of emotional and motivational features, both mediated by
      different NT pathways in the PFC. We review the knowledge recently gained on
      cognitive functions in mice and our current understanding of PFC NT modulation.
      The combination of these data is expected to provide new hypotheses concerning
      the role of AChRs in cognitive processes.

TI  - Where is ELSA? The early to late shift in aging.
PG  - 2542-53
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhr334 [doi]
AB  - Studies of cognitive and neural aging have recently provided evidence of a shift 
      from an early- to late-onset cognitive control strategy, linked with temporally
      extended activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). It has been uncertain, however,
      whether this age-related shift is unique to PFC and executive control tasks or
      whether the functional location might vary depending on the particular cognitive 
      processes that are altered. The present study tested whether an early-to-late
      shift in aging (ELSA) might emerge in the medial temporal lobes (MTL) during a
      protracted context memory task comprising both anticipatory cue (retrieval
      preparation) and retrieval probe (retrieval completion) phases. First, we found
      reduced MTL activity in older adults during the early retrieval preparation phase
      coupled with increased MTL activity during the late retrieval completion phase.
      Second, we found that functional connectivity between MTL and PFC regions was
      higher during retrieval preparation in young adults but higher during retrieval
      completion in older adults, suggesting an important interactive relationship
      between the ELSA pattern in MTL and PFC. Taken together, these results critically
      suggest that aging results in temporally lagged activity even in regions not
      typically associated with cognitive control, such as the MTL.

TI  - When control fails: influence of the prefrontal but not striatal dopaminergic
      system on behavioural flexibility in a change detection task.
PG  - 1028-33
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.10.012 [doi]
AB  - There is growing interest in understanding the neurobiological foundations of
      attention. To examine whether attentional processes in a change detection task
      are modulated by dopamine signalling, we investigated the influence of two
      polymorphisms, i.e. Val158Met (rs4680) in the catechol-O-methyl transferase
      (COMT) and a variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism (VNTR, rs28363170) in
      the dopamine transporter (DAT1). The COMT Met allele, which results in lower
      enzyme activity and therefore probably enhanced PFC dopamine signalling, was
      significantly associated with task-performance and modulated executive control:
      Homozygous Met/Met allele carriers had difficulties when performing a change
      detection task, particularly showing the greatest difficulties in case cognitive 
      and behavioural flexibility was necessary and the required reaction was not part 
      of the subject's primary task set. Contrary, no difference between the two
      genotype groups were evident, when an attentional conflict emerged and
      attentional control was needed for adequate responding. No association with
      variation in DAT1 was observed. The results indicate a dissociation of the
      prefrontal and striatal dopamine system for attentional control and behavioural
      flexibility in a change detection task: While prefrontal dopamine turnover seems 
      to modulate performance, putatively via difficulties in set shifting leading to
      behavioural inflexibility in COMT Met allele carriers, striatal dopamine turnover
      seems less important in this regard. With respect to other studies examining
      mechanisms of attentional functions in different paradigms, the results suggest
      that behavioural flexibility and attentional control as two executive
      subprocesses are differentially influenced by genetic polymorphisms within the
      dopaminergic system. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled
      'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder'.

AB  - While it is acknowledged that species specific differences are an implicit
      condition of comparative studies, rodent models of prefrontal function serve a
      significant role in the acquisition of converging evidence on prefrontal function
      across levels of analysis and research techniques. The purpose of the present
      review is to examine whether the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in rats supports a
      variety of processes associated with executive function including working memory,
      temporal processing, planning (prospective coding), flexibility, rule learning,
      and decision making. Therefore, in this review we examined changes associated
      with working memory processes for spatial locations, visual objects, odors,
      tastes, and response domains or attributes, temporal processes including temporal
      order, sequence learning, prospective coding, behavioral flexibility associated
      with reversal learning and set shifting, paired associate learning, and decision 
      making based on effort, time discounting, and uncertainty following damage to the
      PFC in rats. In addition, potential parallel processes of executive function in
      monkeys and humans based on several theories of subregional differentiation
      within the PFC will be presented. Specifically, theories based on domain or
      attribute specificity (Goldman-Rakic, 1996), level of processing (Petrides,
      1996), rule learning based on complexity (Wise, Murray, & Gerfen, 1996),
      executive functions based on connectivity with other brain regions associated
      with top-down control (Miller & Cohen, 2001), are presented and applied to PFC
      function in rats with the aim of understanding subregional specificity in the rat
      PFC. The data suggest that there is subregional specificity within the PFC of
      rats, monkey and humans and there are parallel cognitive functions of the
      different subregions of the PFC in rats, monkeys and humans.

AB  - Causal reasoning is a ubiquitous feature of human cognition. We continuously seek
      to understand, at least implicitly and often explicitly, the causal scenarios in 
      which we live, so that we may anticipate what will come next, plan a potential
      response and envision its outcome, decide among possible courses of action in
      light of their probable outcomes, make midstream adjustments in our goal-related 
      activities as our situation changes, and so on. A considerable body of research
      shows that the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) is crucial for causal reasoning,
      but also that there are significant differences in the manner in which
      ventrolateral PFC, dorsolateral PFC, and anterolateral PFC support causal
      reasoning. We propose, on the basis of research on the evolution, architecture,
      and functional organization of the lateral PFC, a general framework for
      understanding its roles in the many and varied sorts of causal reasoning carried 
      out by human beings. Specifically, the ventrolateral PFC supports the generation 
      of basic causal explanations and inferences; dorsolateral PFC supports the
      evaluation of these scenarios in light of some given normative standard (e.g., of
      plausibility or correctness in light of real or imagined causal interventions);
      and anterolateral PFC supports explanation and inference at an even higher level 
      of complexity, coordinating the processes of generation and evaluation with
      further cognitive processes, and especially with computations of hedonic value
      and emotional implications of possible behavioral scenarios - considerations that
      are often critical both for understanding situations causally and for deciding
      about our own courses of action.

TI  - Higher Order Spike Synchrony in Prefrontal Cortex during Visual Memory.
PG  - 23
LID - 10.3389/fncom.2011.00023 [doi]
AB  - Precise temporal synchrony of spike firing has been postulated as an important
      neuronal mechanism for signal integration and the induction of plasticity in
      neocortex. As prefrontal cortex plays an important role in organizing memory and 
      executive functions, the convergence of multiple visual pathways onto PFC
      predicts that neurons should preferentially synchronize their spiking when
      stimulus information is processed. Furthermore, synchronous spike firing should
      intensify if memory processes require the induction of neuronal plasticity, even 
      if this is only for short-term. Here we show with multiple simultaneously
      recorded units in ventral prefrontal cortex that neurons participate in 3 ms
      precise synchronous discharges distributed across multiple sites separated by at 
      least 500 mum. The frequency of synchronous firing is modulated by behavioral
      performance and is specific for the memorized visual stimuli. In particular,
      during the memory period in which activity is not stimulus driven, larger groups 
      of up to seven sites exhibit performance dependent modulation of their spike
      synchronization.

AB  - Cognitive control functions ("executive functions" [EFs] such as attentional
      control, self-regulation, working memory, and inhibition) that depend on
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) are critical for success in school and in life. Many
      children begin school lacking needed EF skills. Disturbances in EFs occur in many
      mental health disorders, such as ADHD and depression. This chapter addresses
      modulation of EFs by biology (genes and neurochemistry) and the environment
      (including school programs) with implications for clinical disorders and for
      education. Unusual properties of the prefrontal dopamine system contribute to
      PFC's vulnerability to environmental and genetic variations that have little
      effect elsewhere. EFs depend on a late-maturing brain region (PFC), yet they can 
      be improved even in infants and preschoolers, without specialists or fancy
      equipment. Research shows that activities often squeezed out of school curricula 
      (play, physical education, and the arts) rather than detracting from academic
      achievement help improve EFs and enhance academic outcomes. Such practices may
      also head off problems before they lead to diagnoses of EF impairments, including
      ADHD. Many issues are not simply education issues or health issues; they are
      both.

PG  - 3037-51
LID - 10.1162/jocn.2011.21633 [doi]
AB  - Vividly remembering the past and imagining the future (mental time travel) seem
      to rely on common neural substrates and mental time travel impairments in
      patients with brain lesions seem to encompass both temporal domains. However,
      because future thinking-or more generally imagining novel events-involves the
      recombination of stored elements into a new event, it requires additional
      resources that are not shared by episodic memory. We aimed to demonstrate this
      asymmetry in an event generation task administered to two patients with lesions
      in the medial dorsal thalamus. Because of the dense connection with pFC, this
      nucleus of the thalamus is implicated in executive aspects of memory (strategic
      retrieval), which are presumably more important for future thinking than for
      episodic memory. Compared with groups of healthy matched control participants,
      both patients could only produce novel events with extensive help of the
      experimenter (prompting) in the absence of episodic memory problems. Impairments 
      were most pronounced for imagining personal fictitious and impersonal events.
      More precisely, the patients' descriptions of novel events lacked content and
      spatio-temporal relations. The observed impairment is unlikely to trace back to
      disturbances in self-projection, scene construction, or time concept and could be
      explained by a recombination deficit. Thus, although memory and the imagination
      of novel events are tightly linked, they also partly rely on different processes.

TI  - Emotion processing in the aging brain is modulated by semantic elaboration.
PG  - 640-50
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.09.009 [doi]
AB  - The neural correlates of emotion processing have been shown to vary with age:
      older adults (OAs) exhibit increased frontal activations and, under some
      circumstances, decreased amygdala activations relative to young adults (YAs)
      during emotion processing. Some of these differences are additionally modulated
      by valence, with age-related biases toward positive versus negative stimuli, and 
      are thought to depend on OAs' capacity for controlled elaboration. However, the
      role of semantic elaboration in mediating valence effects in the aging brain has 
      not yet been explicitly tested. In the present study, YAs and OAs were scanned
      while they viewed negative, neutral, and positive pictures during either a deep, 
      elaborative task or a shallow, perceptual task. fMRI results reveal that
      emotion-related activity in the amygdala is preserved in aging and insensitive to
      elaboration demands. This study provides novel evidence that differences in
      valence processing are modulated by elaboration: relative to YAs, OAs show
      enhanced activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventrolateral PFC in 
      response to positive versus negative stimuli, but only during elaborative
      processing. These positive valence effects are predicted by individual
      differences in executive function in OAs for the deep but not shallow task.
      Finally, psychophysiological interaction analyses reveal age effects on
      valence-dependent functional connectivity between medial PFC and ventral
      striatum, as well as age and task effects on medial PFC-retrosplenial cortex
      interactions. Altogether, these findings provide support for the hypothesis that 
      valence shifts in the aging brain are mediated by controlled processes such as
      semantic elaboration, self-referential processing, and emotion regulation.

TI  - Fronto-striatal contribution to lexical set-shifting.
PG  - 1084-93
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhq182 [doi]
AB  - Fronto-striatal circuits in set-shifting have been examined in neuroimaging
      studies using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) that requires changing the
      classification rule for cards containing visual stimuli that differ in color,
      shape, and number. The present study examined whether this fronto-striatal
      contribution to the planning and execution of set-shifts is similar in a modified
      sorting task in which lexical rules are applied to word stimuli. Young healthy
      adults were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing
      the newly developed lexical version of the WCST: the Wisconsin Word Sorting Task.
      Significant activation was found in a cortico-striatal loop that includes area
      47/12 of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the caudate nucleus
      during the planning of a set-shift, and in another that includes the posterior
      PFC and the putamen during the execution of a set-shift. However, in the present 
      lexical task, additional activation peaks were observed in area 45 of the
      ventrolateral PFC area during both matching periods. These results provide
      evidence that the functional contributions of the various fronto-striatal loops
      are not dependent on the modality of the information to be manipulated but rather
      on the specific executive processes required.

AB  - RATIONALE: Beyond the amelioration of deprivation-induced impairments, and in
      contrast to effects on attentional processes, the cognitive-enhancing properties 
      of nicotine on working memory (WM) operations remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: In an
      effort to elucidate potential enhancing effects, we explored the impact of
      transdermal nicotine on neural functioning in minimally deprived smokers and, in 
      addition, assessed differences between smokers and non-smokers using a mixed
      block/event-related fMRI design that attempted to isolate specific central
      executive operations (attentional switch events) within general WM function (task
      blocks). METHODS: In task blocks, participants performed a continuous counting
      paradigm that required the simultaneous maintenance of, and frequent switching of
      attentional focus between, two running tallies in WM on some trials. Cigarette
      smokers (n = 30) were scanned twice, once each with a nicotine and placebo patch,
      while non-smokers (n = 27) were scanned twice with no patch. RESULTS: Across both
      groups, task blocks were associated with bilateral activation, notably in medial 
      and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior insula, and parietal regions,
      whereas individual attentional switch trials were associated with activation in a
      similar, but predominantly left-lateralized network. Within the smoker group,
      although nicotine increased heart rate, altered performance and mood, and reduced
      tobacco cravings, no acute drug (state-like) effect on brain activity was
      detected for either the task or switch effects. However, relative to non-smokers,
      smokers showed greater tonic activation in medial superior frontal cortex, right 
      anterior insula, and bilateral anterior PFC throughout task blocks (trait-like
      effect). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest smokers require recruitment of
      additional WM and supervisory control operations during task performance.

TI  - Prefrontal cortex and drug abuse vulnerability: translation to prevention and
      treatment interventions.
PG  - 124-49
LID - 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2010.09.001 [doi]
AB  - Vulnerability to drug abuse is related to both reward seeking and impulsivity,
      two constructs thought to have a biological basis in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
      This review addresses similarities and differences in neuroanatomy,
      neurochemistry and behavior associated with PFC function in rodents and humans.
      Emphasis is placed on monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitter systems located
      in anatomically distinct subregions: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); lateral
      prefrontal cortex (lPFC); anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); and orbitofrontal
      cortex (OFC). While there are complex interconnections and overlapping functions 
      among these regions, each is thought to be involved in various functions related 
      to health-related risk behaviors and drug abuse vulnerability. Among the various 
      functions implicated, evidence suggests that mPFC is involved in reward
      processing, attention and drug reinstatement; lPFC is involved in
      decision-making, behavioral inhibition and attentional gating; ACC is involved in
      attention, emotional processing and self-monitoring; and OFC is involved in
      behavioral inhibition, signaling of expected outcomes and reward/punishment
      sensitivity. Individual differences (e.g., age and sex) influence functioning of 
      these regions, which, in turn, impacts drug abuse vulnerability. Implications for
      the development of drug abuse prevention and treatment strategies aimed at
      engaging PFC inhibitory processes that may reduce risk-related behaviors are
      discussed, including the design of effective public service announcements,
      cognitive exercises, physical activity, direct current stimulation, feedback
      control training and pharmacotherapies. A major challenge in drug abuse
      prevention and treatment rests with improving intervention strategies aimed at
      strengthening PFC inhibitory systems among at-risk individuals.

      experimental examination.

LID - 10.1186/1744-9081-6-53 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dopamine in prefrontal cortex (PFC) modulates core cognitive
      processes, notably working memory and executive control. Dopamine regulating
      genes and polymorphisms affecting PFC--including Catechol-O-Methyltransferase
      (COMT) Val158Met--are crucial to understanding the molecular genetics of
      cognitive function and dysfunction. A mechanistic account of the COMT Val158Met
      effect associates the Met allele with increased tonic dopamine transmission
      underlying maintenance of relevant information, and the Val allele with increased
      phasic dopamine transmission underlying the flexibility of updating new
      information. Thus, consistent with some earlier work, we predicted that Val
      carriers would display poorer performance when the maintenance component was
      taxed, while Met carriers would be less efficient when rapid updating was
      required. METHODS: Using a Stroop task that manipulated level of required
      cognitive stability and flexibility, we examined reaction time performance of
      patients with schizophrenia (n = 67) and healthy controls (n = 186) genotyped for
      the Val/Met variation. RESULTS: In both groups we found a Met advantage for tasks
      requiring cognitive stability, but no COMT effect when a moderate level of
      cognitive flexibility was required, or when a conflict cost measure was
      calculated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support a simple
      stability/flexibility model of dopamine COMT Val/Met effects and suggest a
      somewhat different conceptualization and experimental operationalization of these
      cognitive components.

TI  - Motivated cognitive control: reward incentives modulate preparatory neural
      activity during task-switching.
PG  - 10294-305
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2052-10.2010 [doi]
AB  - It is increasingly appreciated that executive control processes need to be
      understood in terms of motivational as well as cognitive mechanisms. The current 
      study examined the impact of performance-contingent reward incentives (monetary
      bonuses) on neural activity dynamics during cued task-switching performance.
      Behavioral measures indicated that performance was improved and task-switch costs
      selectively reduced on incentive trials. Trial-by-trial fluctuations in incentive
      value were associated with activation in reward-related brain regions
      (dopaminergic midbrain, paracingulate cortex) and also modulated the dynamics of 
      switch-selective activation in the brain cognitive control network. Within
      lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), both additive (inferior frontal junction) and
      interactive [dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC)] incentive effects were observed. In DLPFC,
      incentive modulation of activation predicted task-switching behavioral
      performance, but with hemispherically dissociable effects. Furthermore, in left
      DLPFC, incentive modulation specifically enhanced task-cue-related activation,
      and this activation in turn predicted that the trial would be subsequently
      rewarded (because of optimal performance). The results suggest that motivational 
      incentives have a selective effect on brain regions that subserve cognitive
      control processes during task-switching and, moreover, that one mechanism of
      effect might be the enhancement of cue-related task preparation within left
      DLPFC.

PG  - 63-73
LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2010.04.039 [doi]
AB  - We compared reasoning about four-term analogy problems in the format (A:B::C: D) 
      to semantic and perceptual control conditions that required matching without
      analogical mapping. We investigated distinct phases of the problem solving
      process divided into encoding, mapping/inference, and response. Using fMRI, we
      assessed the brain activation relevant to each of these phases with an emphasis
      on achieving a better understanding of analogical reasoning relative to these
      other matching conditions. We predicted that the analogical condition would
      involve the most cognitive effort in the encoding and mapping/inference phases,
      while the control conditions were expected to engage greater prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) activation at the response period. Results showed greater activation for
      the analogical condition relative to the control conditions at the encoding phase
      in several predominantly left lateralized and medial areas of the PFC. Similar
      results were observed for the mapping/inference phase, though this difference was
      limited to the left PFC and rostral PFC. The response phase resulted in the
      fastest and most accurate responses in the analogy condition relative to the
      control conditions. This was accompanied by greater processing within the left
      lateral and the medial PFC for the control conditions relative to the analogy
      condition, consistent with most of the cognitive processing of the analogy
      condition having occurred in the prior task phases. Overall we demonstrate that
      the left ventral and dorsal lateral, medial, and rostral PFC are important in
      both the encoding of relational information, mapping and inference processes, and
      verification of semantic and perceptual responses in four term analogical
      reasoning.

TI  - The Scale of Functional Specialization within Human Prefrontal Cortex.
PG  - 1233-7
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3220-09.2010 [doi]
AB  - At what scale is it possible to observe consistent functional specialization
      within human prefrontal cortex (PFC), reproducible from one individual to the
      next? Some studies suggest gross functional divisions between large regions of
      PFC, but it is not known whether PFC exhibits specialization at the fine-grained 
      scale known to differentiate posterior cortical functions. We used fMRI to
      confirm a three-way segregation of function between three regions of medial
      anterior PFC, each centered on coordinates within 15 mm of the other two. Naive
      participants performed three tasks based on earlier studies, and we investigated 
      activity at regions defined by previous results. In each task, signal was
      significantly greater at the predicted region than the other two, just
      millimeters away. These results indicate reproducible functional specialization
      within PFC, at a much finer scale than previously demonstrated. Furthermore,
      these findings suggest that divergent results from previous studies may reflect
      the recruitment of functionally distinct regions and that "reverse inference"
      should be undertaken with caution.

AB  - Neural systems of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) involved in executive functions are
      particularly vulnerable to sleep deprivation (SD). In this study, we investigated
      whether SD selectively affects specific components of the executive control
      processes involved in task-switching performance. Two different tasks are
      performed in rapid and random succession in this procedure, so that the
      to-be-executed task may change from one trial to the next (switch trial), or may 
      be repeated (repetition trial). Task-switches are usually slower than task
      repetitions, giving way to the 'switch cost'. One hundred and eight university
      students were assigned randomly to the sleep (S) or the SD group. Each of them
      was tested on a task-switching paradigm before and after an experimental night (S
      or SD), and after one recovery night. SD impaired both task-switching accuracy
      and speed. A higher proportion of errors and increased switch costs after SD have
      been observed, compared to normal sleep. Control analyses on switch and
      repetition trials showed that the SD group was significantly worse only on the
      switch trials. The effects of SD are reverted by one night of recovery sleep. It 
      is concluded that the ability to adjust behaviour rapidly and flexibly to
      changing environmental demands, which relies on the functional integrity of the
      PFC, is impacted negatively by sleep loss.

TI  - Age-related shifts in brain activity dynamics during task switching.
PG  - 1420-31
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhp206 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive aging studies have suggested that older adults show declines in both
      sustained and transient cognitive control processes. However, previous
      neuroimaging studies have primarily focused on age-related change in the
      magnitude, but not temporal dynamics, of brain activity. The present study
      compared brain activity dynamics in healthy old and young adults during task
      switching. A mixed blocked/event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
      design enabled separation of transient and sustained neural activity associated
      with cognitive control. Relative to young adults, older adults exhibited not only
      decreased sustained activity in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) during
      task-switching blocks but also increased transient activity on task-switch
      trials. Another pattern of age-related shift in dynamics was present in the
      lateral PFC (lPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), with younger adults
      showing a cue-related response during task-switch trials in lPFC and PPC, whereas
      older adults exhibited switch-related activation during the cue period in PPC
      only. In all 3 regions, these qualitatively distinct patterns of brain activity
      predicted qualitatively distinct patterns of behavioral performance across the 2 
      age groups. Together, these results suggest that older adults may shift from a
      proactive to reactive cognitive control strategy as a means of retaining
      relatively preserved behavioral performance in the face of age-related
      neurocognitive changes.

AB  - The role of the prefrontal Cortex (PFC) in higher cognitive functions - including
      working memory, conflict resolution, set shifting and semantic processing - has
      been demonstrated unequivocally. Despite the great heterogeneity among tasks
      measuring these phenotypes, due in part to the different cognitive sub-processes 
      implied and the specificity of the stimulus material used, there is agreement
      that all of these tasks recruit an executive control system located in the PFC.
      On a biochemical level it is known that the dopaminergic system plays an
      important role in executive control functions. Evidence comes from molecular
      genetics relating the functional COMT Val158Met polymorphism to working memory
      and set shifting. In order determine whether this pattern of findings generalises
      to linguistic and semantic processing, we investigated the effects of the COMT
      Val158Met polymorphism in lexical decision making using masked and unmasked
      versions of the semantic priming paradigm on N = 104 healthy subjects. Although
      we observed strong priming effects in all conditions (masked priming, unmasked
      priming with short/long stimulus asynchronies (SOAs), direct and indirect
      priming), COMT was not significantly related to priming, suggesting no reliable
      influence on semantic processing. However, COMT Val158Met was strongly associated
      with lexical decision latencies in all priming conditions if considered
      separately, explaining between 9 and 14.5% of the variance. Therefore, the
      findings indicate that COMT mainly influences more general executive control
      functions in the PFC supporting the speed of lexical decisions.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves cognitive control, that is, the ability to 
      select thoughts or actions in relation to internal goals. Little is known,
      however, about how the PFC combines motivation and the selection processes
      underlying cognitive control. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in
      humans and found that the medial and lateral PFC have a parallel hierarchical
      organization from posterior to anterior regions for motivating and selecting
      behaviors, respectively. Moreover, using functional connectivity analyses, we
      found that functional interactions in this parallel system from medial to lateral
      PFC regions convey motivational incentives on the basis of rewards/penalties
      regulating the differential engagement of lateral PFC regions in top-down
      selection. Our results indicate that motivation is a dissociable function, reveal
      how the PFC integrates motivation and cognitive control in the service of
      decision-making, and have major implications for current theories of prefrontal
      executive function.

AB  - The goal of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to
      investigate whether and to what extent brain regions involved in high-confidence 
      recognition (HCR) versus low-confidence recognition (LCR) overlap or separate
      from each other. To this end, we performed conjunction analyses involving
      activations elicited during high-confidence hit, low-confidence hit, and
      high-confidence correct rejection responses. The analyses yielded 3 main
      findings. First, sensory/perceptual and associated posterior regions were common 
      to HCR and LCR, indicating contribution of these regions to both HCR and LCR
      activity. This finding may help explain why these regions are among the most
      common in functional neuroimaging studies of episodic retrieval. Second, medial
      temporal lobe (MTL) and associated midline regions were associated with HCR,
      possibly reflecting recollection-related processes, whereas specific prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) regions were associated with LCR, possibly reflecting executive
      control processes. This finding is consistent with the notion that the MTL and
      PFC networks play complementary roles during episodic retrieval. Finally, within 
      posterior parietal cortex, a dorsal region was associated with LCR, possibly
      reflecting top-down attentional processes, whereas a ventral region was
      associated with HCR, possibly reflecting bottom-up attentional processes. This
      finding may help explain why functional neuroimaging studies have found diverse
      parietal effects during episodic retrieval. Taken together, our findings provide 
      strong evidence that HCR versus LCR, and by implication, recollection versus
      familiarity processes, are represented in common as well as specific brain
      regions.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.0808187106 [doi]
AB  - A major challenge in research on executive control is to reveal its functional
      decomposition into underlying neural mechanisms. A typical assumption is that
      this decomposition occurs solely through anatomically based dissociations. Here
      we tested an alternative hypothesis that different cognitive control processes
      may be implemented within the same brain regions, with fractionation and
      dissociation occurring on the basis of temporal dynamics. Regions within lateral 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) were examined that, in a prior study, exhibited
      contrasting temporal dynamics between older and younger adults during performance
      of the AX-CPT cognitive control task. The temporal dynamics in younger adults fit
      a proactive control pattern (primarily cue-based activation), whereas in older
      adults a reactive control pattern was found (primarily probe-based activation).
      In the current study, we found that following a period of task-strategy training,
      these older adults exhibited a proactive shift within a subset of the PFC
      regions, normalizing their activity dynamics toward young adult patterns.
      Conversely, under conditions of penalty-based monetary incentives, the younger
      adults exhibited a reactive shift some of the same regions, altering their
      temporal dynamics toward the older adult baseline pattern. These experimentally
      induced crossover patterns of temporal dynamics provide strong support for dual
      modes of cognitive control that can be flexibly shifted within PFC regions, via
      modulation of neural responses to changing task conditions or behavioral goals.

AB  - Executive function is a term used to describe the cognitive processes subserved
      by the prefrontal cortex (PFC). An extensive body of work has characterized the
      effects of damage to the PFC in nonhuman primates, but it has focused primarily
      on the capacity of recognition and working memory. One limitation in studies of
      the functional parcellation of the PFC has been the absence of tests that assess 
      executive function or its functional components. The current study used an
      adaptation of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, a classic test of frontal lobe and
      executive function in humans, to assess the effects of bilateral lesions in the
      dorsolateral PFC on executive function in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). The
      authors used the category set-shifting task, which requires the monkey to
      establish a pattern of responding to a specific category (color or shape) based
      on reward contingency, maintain that pattern of responding, and then shift to
      responding to a different category when the reward contingency changes. Rhesus
      monkeys with lesions of the dorsolateral PFC were impaired in abstraction,
      establishing a response pattern to a specific category and maintaining and
      shifting that response pattern on the category set-shifting task.

AB  - Treatment with non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists such as
      phencyclidine or ketamine have been shown to induce schizophrenia-like psychotic 
      and cognitive symptoms in humans and animals. However, there have been a number
      of contradictory findings regarding the effects of repeated treatment with these 
      drugs on working memory in experimental animals. We hypothesized that processes
      dependent on dopamine transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) may be
      more sensitive to disruption following these treatment. We assessed the effects
      of repeated treatment with ketamine on working memory performance using a delayed
      spatial win-shift procedure conducted on a radial-arm maze, dependent on a neural
      circuit linking hippocampal and dopamine inputs to the medial PFC. Rats were
      trained on the task prior to drug exposure, after which they were subjected to
      one of two dosing regimes of ketamine (30 mg/kg twice a day for either 5 or 10
      days). After a 10 day withdrawal period, they were re-tested on the task for 15
      days. Ketamine treatment for 10 days, but not 5 days, increased the number of
      errors and days to re-achieve the criterion on the delayed task. However, in a
      separate group of rats, subchronic ketamine treatment (10 days) did not affect
      performance of the non-delayed random foraging task, dependent on the
      hippocampus, but not the PFC. These results indicate that working memory
      performance assessed with these procedures is sensitive to disruption following
      repeated exposure to ketamine. Impairments in working memory induced by these
      treatments are not attributable to dysfunction of motivational, motor, short-term
      or spatial memory processes. The use of these procedures may prove useful in
      modeling impairments in this executive function observed in schizophrenia.

TI  - Reward-dependent modulation of working memory in lateral prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 3259-70
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5353-08.2009 [doi]
AB  - Although research implicates lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in executive control
      and goal-directed behavior, it remains unclear how goals influence executive
      processes. One possibility is that goal-relevant information, such as expected
      rewards, could modulate the representation of information relating to executive
      control, thereby ensuring the efficient allocation of cognitive resources. To
      investigate this, we examined how reward modulated spatial working memory. Past
      studies investigating spatial working memory have focused on dorsolateral PFC,
      but this area only weakly connects with areas processing reward. Ventrolateral
      PFC has better connections in this regard. Thus, we contrasted the functional
      properties of single neurons in ventrolateral and dorsolateral PFC as two
      subjects performed a task that required them to hold spatial information in
      working memory under different expectancies of reward for correct performance. We
      balanced the order of presentation of spatial and reward information so we could 
      assess the neuronal encoding of the two pieces of information independently and
      conjointly. Neurons in ventrolateral PFC encoded both spatial and reward
      information earlier, stronger and in a more sustained manner than neurons in
      dorsolateral PFC. Within ventrolateral PFC, spatial selectivity was more
      prevalent on the inferior convexity than within the principal sulcus. Finally,
      when reward increased spatial selectivity, behavioral performance improved,
      whereas when reward decreased spatial selectivity, behavioral performance
      deteriorated. These results suggest that ventrolateral PFC may be a locus whereby
      information about expected rewards can modulate information in working memory.
      The pattern of results is consistent with a role for ventrolateral PFC in
      attentional control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While many children with brain conditions present with cognitive,
      behavioural, emotional, academic and social impairments, other children recover
      with seemingly few impairments. Animal studies and preliminary child studies have
      identified timing of brain lesion as a key predictor in determining functional
      outcome following early brain lesions. REVIEW: This research suggests that
      knowledge of healthy developmental processes in brain structure and function is
      essential for better understanding functional recovery and outcome in children
      with brain lesions. This review paper aims to equip researchers with current
      knowledge of key principles of developmental processes in brain structure and
      function. Timetables for development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain
      region particularly vulnerable to lesions due to its protracted developmental
      course, are examined. In addition, timetables for development of executive
      skills, which emerge in childhood and have a prolonged developmental course that 
      parallels development of the PFC, are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Equipped with 
      this knowledge, researchers are now in a better position to understand functional
      recovery and outcome in children with brain conditions.

AB  - We review two studies aimed at understanding the role of prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
      in the control of attention. The first study examined which attentional functions
      are critically dependent on PFC by removing PFC unilaterally and transecting the 
      forebrain commissures in two macaques. The monkeys fixated a central cue and
      discriminated the orientation of a colored target grating presented among colored
      distracter gratings in either the hemifield affected by the PFC lesion or the
      normal control hemifield. When the cue was held constant for many trials, task
      performance in the affected hemifield was nearly normal. However, performance was
      severely impaired when the cue was switched frequently across trials. The monkeys
      were unimpaired in a pop-out task with changing targets that did not require
      top-down attentional control. Thus, the PFC lesion resulted in selective
      impairment in the monkeys' ability to switch top-down control. In the second
      study, we used fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of top-down control in
      humans performing tasks identical to those used in the monkey experiments.
      Several fronto-parietal and posterior visual areas showed enhanced activation
      when attention was switched, which was greater on color cueing (top-down) trials 
      relative to pop-out trials. Taken together, our findings indicate that both
      frontal and parietal cortices are involved in generating top-down control signals
      for attentive switching, which may then be fed back to visual processing areas.
      The PFC in particular plays a critical role in the ability to switch attentional 
      control on the basis of changing task demands.

TI  - The contributions of prefrontal cortex and executive control to deception:
      evidence from activation likelihood estimate meta-analyses.
PG  - 1557-66
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhn189 [doi]
AB  - Previous neuroimaging studies have implicated the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
      nearby brain regions in deception. This is consistent with the hypothesis that
      lying involves the executive control system. To date, the nature of the
      contribution of different aspects of executive control to deception, however,
      remains unclear. In the present study, we utilized an activation likelihood
      estimate (ALE) method of meta-analysis to quantitatively identify brain regions
      that are consistently more active for deceptive responses relative to truthful
      responses across past studies. We then contrasted the results with additional ALE
      maps generated for 3 different aspects of executive control: working memory,
      inhibitory control, and task switching. Deception-related regions in dorsolateral
      PFC and posterior parietal cortex were selectively associated with working
      memory. Additional deception regions in ventrolateral PFC, anterior insula, and
      anterior cingulate cortex were associated with multiple aspects of executive
      control. In contrast, deception-related regions in bilateral inferior parietal
      lobule were not associated with any of the 3 executive control constructs. Our
      findings support the notion that executive control processes, particularly
      working memory, and their associated neural substrates play an integral role in
      deception. This work provides a foundation for future research on the
      neurocognitive basis of deception.

TI  - Tolcapone enhances food-evoked dopamine efflux and executive memory processes
      mediated by the rat prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 521-30
LID - 10.1007/s00213-008-1342-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Genetic variations in catechol-O-methyl transferase
      (COMT) or administration of COMT inhibitors have a robust impact on cognition and
      executive function in humans. The COMT enzyme breaks down extracellular dopamine 
      (DA) and has a particularly important role in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) where
      DA transporters are sparse. As such, the beneficial cognitive effects of the COMT
      inhibitor tolcapone are postulated to be the result of increased bioavailability 
      of DA in the PFC. Furthermore, it has been shown previously that COMT inhibitors 
      increase pharmacologically evoked DA but do not affect basal levels in the PFC.
      OBJECTIVES: The current study characterized the ability of tolcapone to increase 
      DA release in response to behaviorally salient stimuli and improve performance of
      the delayed spatial win-shift (DSWSh) task. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Tolcapone
      enhanced PFC DA efflux associated with the anticipation and consumption of food
      when compared to saline controls. Chronic and acute treatment with tolcapone also
      reduced the number of errors committed during acquisition of the DSWSh. However, 
      no dissociable effects were observed in experiments designed to selectively assay
      encoding or recall in well-trained animals, as both experiments showed
      improvement with tolcapone treatment. Taken together, these data suggest a
      generalized positive influence on cognition. Furthermore, these data support the 
      conclusion of Apud and Weinberger (CNS Drugs 21:535-557, 2007) that agents which 
      selectively potentiate PFC DA release may confer cognitive enhancement without
      the unwanted side effects produced by drugs that increase basal DA levels in
      cortical and subcortical brain regions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Deficits in working memory are commonly observed after traumatic
      brain injury (TBI), with executive control processes preferentially impacted
      relative to storage and rehearsal. Previous activation functional neuroimaging
      investigations of working memory in patients with TBI have reported altered
      functional recruitment, but methodologic issues including sample heterogeneity
      (e.g., variability in injury mechanism, severity, neuropathology or chronicity), 
      underspecified definitions of "working memory," and behavioral differences
      between TBI and control groups have hindered interpretation of these changes.
      METHODS: Executive control processing in working memory was explicitly engaged
      during fMRI in a sample of carefully selected chronic-stage, moderate-to-severe
      TBI patients with diffuse axonal injury (DAI) but without focal lesions. RESULTS:
      Despite equivalent task performance, we observed a pattern of greater recruitment
      of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
      posterior cortices in our DAI sample. Enhanced activations were recorded in the
      left dorsolateral PFC (middle frontal gyrus), right ventrolateral PFC (inferior
      frontal gyrus), bilateral posterior parietal cortices, and left temporo-occipital
      junction. Region-of-interest analyses confirmed that these effects were robust
      across individual patients and could not be attributed to load factors or slowed 
      speed of processing. CONCLUSIONS: Augmented functional recruitment in the context
      of normal behavioral performance may be a neural marker of capacity or efficiency
      limits that can affect functional outcome after traumatic brain injury with
      diffuse injury.

TI  - Disentangling the prefrontal network for rule selection by means of a non-verbal 
      variant of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.
PG  - 1734-43
LID - 10.1002/hbm.20637 [doi]
AB  - This study disentangles the prefrontal network underlying executive functions
      involved in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). During the WCST, subjects
      have to perform two key processes: first, they have to derive the correct sorting
      rule for each trial by trial-and-error, and, second, they have to detect when
      this sorting rule is changed by the investigator. Both cognitive processes
      constitute key components of the executive system, which is subserved by the
      prefrontal cortex. For the current fMRI experiment, we developed a non-verbal
      variant of the WCST. Subjects were instructed either to respond according to a
      given sorting rule or to detect the correct sorting rule, like in the original
      version of the WCST. Data were obtained from 14 healthy male volunteers and
      analysed using SPM and a random effects model. All conditions activated a
      fronto-parietal network, which was generally more active when subjects had to
      search for the correct sorting rule than when the rule was announced beforehand. 
      Significant differences between these two conditions were seen in the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the parietal lobe. In addition, the data
      provided new evidence for the assumption of differentiated roles of the left and 
      right prefrontal cortex. Although the right PFC showed a general involvement in
      response selection and the execution of goal directed responses, based on given
      rules, the left PFC was only activated when inductive reasoning and feedback
      integration was required.

AB  - The history of clinical frontal lobe study is long and rich which provides
      valuable insights into neuropsychologic determinants of functions of prefrontal
      cortex (PFC). PFC is often classified as multimodal association cortex as
      extremely processed information from various sensory modalities is integrated
      here in a precise fashion to form the physiologic constructs of memory,
      perception, and diverse cognitive processes. Human neuropsychologic studies also 
      support the notion of different functional operations within the PFC. The
      specification of the component 'executive' processes and their localization to
      particular regions of PFC have been implicated in a wide variety of psychiatric
      disorders.

TI  - Plasticity and memory in the prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 29-46
AB  - Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies in humans have shown that the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in long-term memory functioning. In general, 
      the participation of the PFC in long-term memory has been attributed to its role 
      in executive control rather than information storage. Accumulating data from
      recent animal studies, however, suggest the possible role of the PFC in the
      storage of long-term memory. In support of this view, there is evidence that
      various projection systems in the PFC support long-term synaptic plasticity.
      Recording studies have further demonstrated neural correlates of learning in
      various animal species. Lastly, behavioral and physiological studies indicate
      that the PFC is critically involved in memory consolidation, retrieval and
      extinction processes. These studies then suggest that the PFC is an integral part
      of the neural network where long-term memory trace is stored and retrieved.
      Though decisive evidence is still lacking at present, we propose here to assign a
      term 'control memory' (i.e., memory for top-down control processes) as a new type
      of memory function for the PFC. This new principle of PFC-long-term memory can
      help organize existing data and provide novel insights into future empirical
      studies.

LID - 10.1155/2008/143238 [doi]
AB  - Early functional neuroimaging studies of tasks evaluating executive processes,
      such as the Wisconsin card sorting task (WCST), only assessed trials in blocks
      that may contain a large amount of different cognitive processes. More recently, 
      we showed using event-related fMRI that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DL-PFC) significantly increased activity during feedback but not matching
      periods of the WCST, consistent with its proposed role in the monitoring of
      information in working memory. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) is a method that allows to disrupt processing within a given cortical
      region and to affect task performance for which this region is significantly
      solicited. Here we applied rTMS to test the hypothesis that the DL-PFC
      stimulation influences monitoring of working memory without interfering with
      other executive functions. We applied rTMS to the right DL-PFC and the vertex
      (control site) in different time points of the WCST. When rTMS was applied to the
      DL-PFC specifically during the period when subjects were receiving feedback
      regarding their previous response, WCST performance deteriorated, while rTMS did 
      not affect performance during matching either when maintaining set or during
      set-shifting. This selective impairment of the DL-PFC is consistent with its
      proposed role in monitoring of events in working memory.

TI  - Prefrontal contributions to domain-general executive control processes during
      temporal context retrieval.
PG  - 1088-103
AB  - Neuroimaging studies have reported increased prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity
      during temporal context retrieval versus recognition memory. However, it remains 
      unclear if these activations reflect PFC contributions to domain-general
      executive control processes or domain-specific retrieval processes. To gain a
      better understanding of the functional roles of these various PFC regions during 
      temporal context retrieval we propose it is necessary to examine PFC activity
      across tasks from different domains, in which parallel manipulations are included
      targeting specific cognitive processes. In the current fMRI study, we examined
      domain-general and domain-specific PFC contributions to temporal context
      retrieval by increasing stimulus (but maintaining response number) and increasing
      response number (but maintaining stimulus number) across temporal context memory 
      and ordering control tasks, for faces. The control task required subjects to
      order faces from youngest to oldest. Our behavioral results indicate that the
      combination of increased stimulus and response numbers significantly increased
      task difficulty for temporal context retrieval and ordering tasks. Across
      domains, increasing stimulus number, while maintaining response numbers, caused
      greater right lateral premotor cortex (BA 6/8) activity; whereas increasing
      response number, while maintaining stimulus number, caused greater domain-general
      left DLPFC (BA 9) and VLPFC (BA 44/45) activity. In addition, we found
      domain-specific right DLPFC (BA 9) activity only during retrieval events. These
      results highlight the functional heterogeneity of frontal cortex, and suggest its
      involvement in temporal context retrieval is related to its role in various
      cognitive control processes.

TI  - Activation of the prefrontal cortex during the Trail-Making Test detected with
      multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy.
PG  - 616-21
AB  - The Trail-Making Test (TMT) is a neuropsychological test for evaluating executive
      function, and the TMT Part B reflects more complex cognitive processes including 
      cognitive set shifting. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to be involved in 
      these cognitive processes. The purpose of the present paper was to investigate
      PFC activation during performance of the TMT Part A and Part B using multichannel
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Subjects were 41 healthy right-handed
      volunteers. The hemodynamic changes in the PFC during the TMT were measured on a 
      22-channel NIRS machine. The subjects had a greater increase of oxygenated
      hemoglobin ([oxyHb]) during the TMT Part B than during Part A in the PFC.
      Twenty-seven out of the 41 subjects had a bilateral increase of [oxyHb] in the
      PFC during Part B according to laterality index. NIRS detected activation in the 
      PFC during the performance of the TMT Part B and this PFC activation may reflect 
      executive functions including cognitive set shifting involved in the TMT Part B.

TI  - Differential regulation of fronto-executive function by the monoamines and
      acetylcholine.
PG  - i151-60
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is innervated by the monoamines, dopamine (DA),
      noradrenaline (NA), and serotonin, as well as acetylcholine, and the marked
      influence of these neurochemical systems on prefrontal working memory processes
      has been widely described. However, their potentially, differential contribution 
      to prefrontal functioning is less well understood. This paper reviews evidence to
      support the hypothesis that these neurochemical systems recruit distinct
      fronto-executive operations. Direct comparison of the effects of manipulations of
      these neuromodulators within PFC on performance of an attentional set-shifting
      paradigm reveals their differential contribution to distinct task stages.
      Depletion of prefrontal serotonin selectively disrupts reversal learning but not 
      attentional set formation or set shifting. In contrast, depletion of prefrontal
      DA disrupts set formation but not reversal learning. NA depletion on the other
      hand specifically impairs set-shifting, whereas its effects on reversal learning 
      remain unclear. Finally, depletion of prefrontal acetylcholine has no effect on
      either set formation or set shifting but impairs serial reversal learning.
      Because these neurochemical systems are known to represent distinct states of
      stress, arousal, attention, and affect, it is postulated that they augment the
      different types of executive operation that are recruited and performed within
      these states via a synergistic interaction with the PFC.

TI  - Separating sustained from transient aspects of cognitive control during thought
      suppression.
PG  - 292-7
AB  - Cognitive theories of how people regulate their thoughts have suggested the
      involvement of two control processes that occur over different time courses.
      These cognitive accounts parallel recent neural models of executive control,
      which suggest that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediates sustained changes in the 
      allocation of control processes, whereas the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
      relays a transient need for additional control. Combining these cognitive and
      neural models of control, we used recently developed analysis techniques to
      distinguish transient from sustained changes in brain activation while subjects
      attempted to suppress an unwanted thought. Results were consistent with both
      models: Dorsolateral PFC demonstrated sustained increases in activation during
      attempts at thought suppression, whereas bilateral ACC demonstrated transient
      increases associated with occurrences of unwanted thoughts. These data support
      proposals regarding the different contributions made by the PFC and ACC to
      executive control and provide initial neuroimaging support for dual-process
      models of how individuals regulate their thoughts.

TI  - Serotonin2C receptor localization in GABA neurons of the rat medial prefrontal
      cortex: implications for understanding the neurobiology of addiction.
PG  - 1677-88
AB  - Serotonin (5-HT) action via the 5-HT(2C) receptor (5-HT(2C)R) provides an
      important modulatory influence over neurons of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which
      is critically involved in disorders of executive function including substance use
      disorders. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of the
      5-HT(2C)R in the rat prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL), a subregion of the medial
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC), using a polyclonal antibody raised against the
      5-HT(2C)R. The expression of 5-HT(2C)R immunoreactivity (IR) was highest in the
      deep layers (layers V/VI) of the mPFC. The 5-HT(2C)R-IR was typically most
      intense at the periphery of cell bodies and the initial segment of cell
      processes. Approximately 50% of the 5-HT(2C)R-IR detected was found in glutamate 
      decarboxylase, isoform 67 (GAD 67)-positive neurons. Of the subtypes of GABA
      interneurons identified by expression of several calcium-binding proteins, a
      significantly higher percentage of neurons expressing IR for parvalbumin also
      expressed 5-HT(2C)R-IR than did the percentage of neurons expressing calbindin-IR
      or calretinin-IR that also expressed 5-HT(2C)R-IR. Since parvalbumin is located
      in basket and chandelier GABA interneurons which project to cell body and initial
      axon segments of pyramidal cells, respectively, these results raise the
      possibility that the 5-HT(2C)R in the mPFC acts via the parvalbumin-positive
      GABAergic interneurons to regulate the output of pyramidal cells in the rat mPFC.

TI  - Shifting and stopping: fronto-striatal substrates, neurochemical modulation and
      clinical implications.
PG  - 917-32
AB  - The neuropsychological basis of attentional set-shifting, task-set switching and 
      stop-signal inhibition is reviewed through comparative studies of humans and
      experimental animals. Using human functional neuroimaging, plus
      neuropsychological investigation of patients with frontal damage quantified by
      structural magnetic resonance imaging, and through parallels with effects of
      specific lesions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum in rats and
      marmosets, it is possible to define both distinct and overlapping loci for tasks 
      such as extra-dimensional shifting and reversal learning, stop-signal reaction
      time and task-set switching. Notably, most of the paradigms implicate a locus in 
      the right PFC, specifically the right inferior frontal gyrus, possibly associated
      with processes of response inhibition. The neurochemical modulation of
      fronto-striatal circuitry in parallel with effects on task performance has been
      investigated using specific neuropharmacological agents in animals and by human
      psychopharmacological investigations, sometimes in conjunction with functional
      imaging. Evidence is provided for double dissociations of effects of
      manipulations of prefrontal cortical catecholamine and indoleamine (5-HT) systems
      that have considerable implications in the treatment of disorders such as
      Parkinson's disease, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and depression, as 
      well as in theoretical notions of how 'fronto-executive' functions are subject to
      state-dependent influences, probably related to stress, arousal and motivation.

TI  - Refreshing: a minimal executive function.
PG  - 135-45
AB  - Executive functions include processes by which important information (e.g.,
      words, objects, task goals, contextual information) generated via perception or
      thought can be foregrounded and thereby influence current and subsequent
      processing. One simple executive process that has the effect of foregrounding
      information is refreshing--thinking briefly of a just-activated representation.
      Previous studies (e.g., Johnson et al., 2005) identified refresh-related activity
      in several areas of left prefrontal cortex (PFC). To further specify the
      respective functions of these PFC areas in refreshing, in Experiment 1, healthy
      young adult participants were randomly cued to think of a just previously seen
      word (refresh) or cued to press a button (act). Compared to simply reading a
      word, refresh and act conditions resulted in similar levels of activity in left
      lateral anterior PFC but only refreshing resulted in greater activity in left
      dorsolateral PFC. In Experiment 2, refreshing was contrasted with a minimal
      phonological rehearsal condition. Refreshing was associated with activity in left
      dorsolateral PFC and rehearsing with activity in left ventrolateral PFC. In both 
      experiments, correlations of activity among brain areas suggest different
      functional connectivity for these processes. Together, these findings provide
      evidence that (1) left lateral anterior PFC is associated with initiating a
      non-automatic process, (2) left dorsolateral PFC is associated with foregrounding
      a specific mental representation, and (3) refreshing and rehearsing are neurally 
      distinguishable processes.

TI  - Variations in the catechol O-methyltransferase polymorphism and prefrontally
      guided behaviors in adolescents.
PG  - 626-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene codes for an enzyme that
      degrades prefrontal cortex (PFC) synaptic dopamine. Of two identified alleles
      (Met and Val), the Met allele results in COMT activity that is up to 4 times less
      pronounced than that conferred by the Val allele, resulting in greater PFC
      dopamine concentrations. Met-Met homozygotes perform better than individuals who 
      possess the Val allele on PFC-mediated cognitive tasks. These genotypic
      variations and their associations with executive functions have been described in
      adults and prepubescent children, but there is a paucity of research assessing
      these relations in adolescent samples. METHODS: In this study, 70 children aged
      9-17 were genotyped for COMT and completed measures of working memory, attention,
      fine motor coordination, and motor speed. RESULTS: COMT genotype modulated all
      but the motor speed measures. The Val-Met genotype was optimal for performance in
      this adolescent sample. CONCLUSIONS: Results are discussed within the context of 
      developmental changes in the dopaminergic system during adolescence.

AB  - The goal of this study was to assess the influence of sex steroid hormone
      suppression on performance on tests of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and working memory
      function (WM) in premenopausal women. Twenty-five women were treated with
      leuprolide acetate depot (LAD), a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog
      that chemically suppressed ovarian function as treatment of various benign
      gynecologic disorders. Performance on tests of PFC and WM of the LAD-treated
      women was assessed at pretreatment baseline and, again, following 4 weeks of
      treatment and their performance was compared to that of 25 healthy, control
      participants matched on age, education, and general intelligence. Following 4
      weeks of LAD treatment, estrogen levels decreased to the postmenopausal range
      whereas progesterone levels fell to the lower limit of the menstrual cycle range 
      of values. Furthermore, the LAD-treated women also experienced a significant
      deterioration in mood, in health-related symptoms and in performance on two tests
      of WM following 4 weeks of treatment. It was determined that only the
      post-treatment declines in estrogen, but not those in progesterone, in mood, or
      in health-related symptoms were associated with the worsening of performance on
      the WM tests. These findings provide new evidence that estrogen is influential in
      the maintenance of WM processes in premenopausal women.

TI  - Isolating rule- versus evidence-based prefrontal activity during episodic and
      lexical discrimination: a functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation of 
      detection theory distinctions.
PG  - 1614-22
AB  - Dorsolateral and frontopolar prefrontal cortices (PFCs) are often implicated in
      neuroimaging studies of memory retrieval, with this activity ascribed to
      controlled monitoring processes indicative of difficult or demanding retrieval.
      Difficulty, however, is multiply determined, with success rates governed both by 
      the available evidence and by the nature of decision rules applied to that
      evidence. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we isolated 
      these factors by 1) contrasting different decision rules across matched evidence 
      and 2) manipulating the level of evidence within a fixed decision rule. For
      identically constructed retrieval probes (1 old and 1 new item), same-different
      (are these different?) compared with forced-choice (which one is old?) decision
      rules yielded bilateral dorsolateral and right frontopolar PFC increases.
      However, these regions were unaffected when the available evidence was greatly
      lowered within forced-choice decisions. Thus, the regions were simultaneously
      sensitive to the type of decision rule and yet insensitive to the level of
      evidence supporting those decisions. Analogous lexical tasks yielded similar
      patterns, demonstrating that the PFC responses were not episodic memory specific.
      We discuss the mechanistic differences between same-different versus
      forced-choice decisions and the implications of these data for current theories
      of PFC activity during episodic remembering and executive control.

TI  - Delay-period activity in the prefrontal cortex: one function is sensory gating.
PG  - 1679-90
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) contributes to working memory functions via executive
      control processes that do not entail the storage, per se, of mnemonic
      representations. One of these control processes may be a sensory gating mechanism
      that facilitates retention of representations in working memory by
      down-regulating the gain of the sensory processing of intervening irrelevant
      stimuli. This idea was tested by scanning healthy young adults with functional
      magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a delayed face-recognition task. 
      The 2 x 2 factorial design varied the factors of Memory (present, absent) and
      Distraction (present, absent). During memory-present trials, target and probe
      stimuli were individual gray-scale male faces. Memory-absent trials were
      identical, except that they employed the same recurring female faces (denoting a 
      "no memory" trial). Distraction-present trials featured rapid serial visual
      presentation of bespectacled male faces during the two middle seconds of the
      delay. The first step of the analyses identified dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) and
      inferior occipitotemporal cortex (IOTC) voxels exhibiting delay-period activity
      in memory-present/distraction-absent trials, that is, the "unfilled" delay.
      Within these voxels, distraction-evoked activity in the dlPFC was markedly higher
      during trials that required the concurrent short-term retention of information
      than on those that did not, whereas the opposite effect was seen in the IOTC.
      These results are consistent with the view that processes related to sensory
      gating account for a portion of the delay-period activity that is routinely
      observed in the dlPFC.

TI  - Intact hemispheric specialization for spatial and shape working memory in
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using functional MRI, we investigated whether, like healthy subjects, 
      patients with schizophrenia show a relative hemispheric specialization in
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) for spatial and shape working memory (WM). 
      We hypothesized that reduced specialization in schizophrenia would reflect a
      failure to adopt optimal domain-specific strategies and would contribute to WM
      deficits. METHODS: Twelve healthy subjects and 16 schizophrenia patients
      performed spatial and shape WM tasks and a non-WM control task. Direct
      comparisons of the spatial and shape WM tasks assessed specialization. RESULTS:
      Despite deficient WM performance, both patients and controls showed a relative
      hemispheric specialization in ventrolateral PFC for spatial (right) and shape
      (left) WM and did not differ in this regard. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of intact
      hemispheric specialization in ventrolateral PFC suggests that patients employ the
      same domain-specific strategies as healthy subjects during spatial and shape WM. 
      Rather than reflecting a failure to adopt the optimal strategy, we hypothesize
      that WM deficits in schizophrenia reflect impairments of executive processes that
      are required for WM performance regardless of domain. These processes are
      associated with activity in the dorsolateral PFC, a region that has been
      repeatedly implicated in studies of WM.

TI  - Dissociating prefrontal contributions during a recency memory task.
PG  - 350-64
AB  - Neuroimaging studies of normal young adults have consistently found right
      prefrontal cortex (RPFC) activity during the performance of recency memory tasks.
      However, it is unclear whether the involvement of RPFC during these tasks
      reflects retrieval processes or executive processes such as: strategic ordering
      or monitoring. In the current study, we distinguish between those PFC regions
      that are more related to retrieval processes, versus strategic ordering
      processes. An event-related fMRI study was conducted in which eight young
      subjects were scanned while performing verbal episodic retrieval tasks
      (recognition and recency memory tasks), and verbal non-memory strategic
      organizing control tasks (reverse alphabetizing of words). The fMRI results show 
      that young subjects engaged right dorsolateral PFC during recency and reverse
      alphabetizing control tasks. Left ventral PFC was engaged across all tasks;
      however, a subset of voxels within this region was more active during retrieval
      tasks. Left dorsolateral and right ventral PFC activity was more related to the
      performance of reverse alphabetizing tasks, respectively. We conclude that right 
      dorsolateral PFC activity during recency memory reflects more general strategic
      organizational or monitoring processes, and is not EM-specific.

TI  - Behavioral and morphological alterations following neonatal excitotoxic lesions
      of the medial prefrontal cortex in rats.
PG  - 185-98
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is essential for executive functions in mammals.
      Damage of the developing PFC may partly be compensated over time, but may also
      lead to structural and functional deficits due to neurodevelopmental
      disturbances. The present study investigated the effects of excitotoxic lesions
      of the medial PFC (mPFC) in neonatal rats on brain morphology, myelination and
      behavior. Neonatal lesions were induced with ibotenate on postnatal day (pd) 7
      and all animals were tested pre- and postpubertally for prepulse inhibition (PPI)
      of the acoustic startle reflex (ASR), locomotor activity and food preference.
      Furthermore, adult rats were tested for apomorphine sensitivity of PPI and for
      their performance in a progressive ratio operant response task. Neonatally
      lesioned animals showed a reduced volume of the mPFC, enlarged ventricles and a
      deficient myelination in some projection areas of the mPFC, including the
      thalamus, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens (NAC) and amygdala. PPI was enhanced in 
      lesioned rats when tested as juveniles, but PPI-deficits induced by the dopamine 
      receptor agonist apomorphine were exacerbated in adult rats after neonatal mPFC
      lesion. Furthermore, the break point in a progressive ratio task was lower in
      lesioned animals, whereas the total number of lever presses was initially
      increased, indicating an impulsive response of rats for food reward under a
      progressive ratio schedule after neonatal mPFC lesion. No effects were found on
      food preference and open field performance. These data support the hypothesis
      that neonatal mPFC lesions lead to disruptions of neurodevelopmental processes in
      a cortico-limbic-striatal network, which are manifested in adult animals as
      morphological and behavioral disturbances.

TI  - Prefrontal cortex and the mediation of proactive interference in working memory.
PG  - 600-8
AB  - Mediating proactive interference (PI), the deleterious effect of antecedent
      information on current memory representations, is believed to be a key function
      of prefrontal cortex (PFC). Item-specific PI results when an invalid probe
      matches a memorandum from the preceding trial; item-nonspecific PI is produced by
      the accumulation of no-longer-relevant items from previous trials. We tested the 
      hypothesis that these two types of PI are mediated by common PFC-based processes 
      with an fMRI study of a delayed-recognition task designed to produce both types
      of PI. Our results indicated that the fMRI correlates of both effects were
      restricted both to Brodmann's area 45 in the left hemisphere and to the memory
      probe epoch of the trial. These results suggest that a unification of the
      literatures and approaches that have independently studied these phenomena might 
      offer a fruitful new perspective from which to study the relations between
      working memory, executive control, and the PFC.

PG  - 132-43
AB  - We used fMRI to study the brain processes involved in the executive control of
      behavior. The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), which allows
      unpredictable and predictable NOGO events to be contrasted, was imaged using a
      mixed (block and event-related) fMRI design to examine tonic and phasic processes
      involved in response inhibition, error detection, conflict monitoring and
      sustained attention. A network of regions, including right ventral prefrontal
      cortex (PFC), left dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and right inferior parietal cortex,
      was activated for successful unpredictable inhibitions, while rostral anterior
      cingulate was implicated in error processing and the pre-SMA in conflict
      monitoring. Furthermore, the pattern of correlations between left dorsolateral
      PFC, implicated in task-set maintenance, and the pre-SMA were indicative of a
      tight coupling between prefrontally mediated control and conflict levels
      monitored more posteriorly. The results reveal that the executive control of
      behavior can be separated into distinct functions performed by discrete cortical 
      regions.

TI  - Cortico-subcortical contributions to executive control.
PG  - 271-89
AB  - The term "executive functions" refers to a range of cognitive processes, their
      common feature being the coordination of information processing and action
      control. Cortico-subcortical circuits which connect the prefrontal cortex (PFC), 
      the basal ganglia and the cerebellum via the thalamus are believed to serve as
      neuroanatomical substrates of executive processing. This paper focuses on
      information processing related to executive functions by the PFC and related
      subcortical regions. Findings are mainly derived from neuropsychological
      investigations of brain-damaged patients but also from imaging studies in healthy
      subjects. There is evidence for subtle differences between these regions with
      respect to the cognitive mechanisms contributing to inhibition of habitual
      responses, task management/multitasking and set shifting, although the data base 
      is sparse so far.

TI  - The prefrontal cortex: insights from functional neuroimaging using cognitive
      activation tasks.
PG  - 408-16
AB  - This review presents neuroimaging studies which have explored the functional
      anatomy of a variety of cognitive processes represented by the prefrontal cortex 
      (PFC). Overall, these studies have demonstrated that standard prefrontal
      neuroactivation tasks recruit a widely distributed network within the brain of
      which the PFC consistently forms a part. As such, these results are in keeping
      with the notion that executive functions within the PFC rely not only on anterior
      (mainly prefrontal) brain areas, but also on posterior (mainly parietal) brain
      regions. Moreover, intervention of similar brain regions in a large number of
      different executive tasks suggests that higher-level cognitive functions may best
      be understood in terms of an interactive network of specialised anterior as well 
      as posterior brain regions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal characteristics of hemodynamic changes in the human lateral
      prefrontal cortex during working memory tasks.
PG  - 1493-504
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is widely believed to subserve mental manipulation
      and monitoring processes ascribed to the central executive (CE) of working memory
      (WM). We attempted to examine and localize the CE by functional imaging of the
      frontal cortex during tasks designed to require the CE. Using near-infrared
      spectroscopy, we studied the spatiotemporal dynamics of oxygenated hemoglobin
      (oxy-Hb), an indicator of changes in regional cerebral blood flow, in both sides 
      of lateral PFC during WM intensive tasks. In most participants, increases in
      oxy-Hb were localized within one subdivison during performance of the n-back
      task, whereas oxy-Hb increased more diffusely during the random number generation
      (RNG) task. Activation of the ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) was prominent in the
      n-back task; both sustained and transient dynamics were observed. Transient
      dynamics means that oxy-Hb first increases but then decreases to less than 50% of
      the peak value or below the baseline level before the end of the task. For the
      RNG task sustained activity was also observed in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC),
      especially in the right hemisphere. However, details of patterns of activation
      varied across participants: subdivisions commonly activated during performance of
      the two tasks were the bilateral VLPFCs, either side of the VLPFC, and either
      side of the DLPFC in 4, 2, and 4 of the 12 participants, respectively. The
      remaining 2 of the 12 participants had no regions commonly activated by these
      tasks. These results suggest that although the PFC is implicated in the CE, there
      is no stereotyped anatomical PFC substrate for the CE.

TI  - The architecture of cognitive control in the human prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 1181-5
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves cognitive control: the ability to
      coordinate thoughts or actions in relation with internal goals. Its functional
      architecture, however, remains poorly understood. Using brain imaging in humans, 
      we showed that the lateral PFC is organized as a cascade of executive processes
      from premotor to anterior PFC regions that control behavior according to stimuli,
      the present perceptual context, and the temporal episode in which stimuli occur, 
      respectively. The results support an unified modular model of cognitive control
      that describes the overall functional organization of the human lateral PFC and
      has basic methodological and theoretical implications.

TI  - Executive control during episodic retrieval: multiple prefrontal processes
      subserve source memory.
PG  - 989-96
AB  - During recognition, one may sense items as familiar (item memory) and
      additionally recollect specific contextual details of the earlier encounters
      (source memory). Cognitive theory suggests that, unlike item memory, source
      memory requires controlled cue specification and monitoring processes. Functional
      imaging suggests that such processes may depend on left prefrontal cortex (PFC). 
      However, the nature and possible anatomical segregation of these processes
      remains unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we isolated
      distinct response patterns in left PFC during source memory consistent with
      semantic analysis/cue specification (anterior ventrolateral), recollective
      monitoring (posterior dorsolateral and frontopolar), and phonological
      maintenance/rehearsal (posterior ventrolateral). Importantly, cue specification
      and recollective monitoring responses were not seen during item memory and were
      unaffected by retrieval success, demonstrating that the mere attempt to recollect
      episodic detail engages multiple control processes with different left PFC
      substrates.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea and the prefrontal cortex: towards a comprehensive model 
      linking nocturnal upper airway obstruction to daytime cognitive and behavioral
      deficits.
PG  - 1-16
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is accompanied by significant daytime cognitive and
      behavioral deficits that extend beyond the effects of sleepiness. This article
      outlines a causal model by which to understand these psychological effects among 
      OSA patients. The model proposes that sleep disruption and blood gas
      abnormalities prevent sleep-related restorative processes, and further induce
      chemical and structural central nervous system cellular injury. This, in turn,
      leads to dysfunction of prefrontal regions of the brain cortex (PFC), manifested 
      behaviorally in what neuropsychologists have termed 'executive dysfunction'.
      Executive dysfunction is proposed to markedly affect the functional application
      of cognitive abilities, resulting in maladaptive daytime behaviors. The proposed 
      model (1) accounts for the specific psychological phenotype associated with OSA, 
      (2) accommodates developmental components in this phenotype, (3) bridges between 
      physical and psychological phenomena, (4) suggests mechanisms by which the
      nocturnal disorder might have effects on daytime functioning, (5) is empirically 
      testable, (6) generates unique research hypotheses, and (7) has practical
      implications. The model is intended to act as a catalyst for future research and 
      as a preliminary guide for clinicians.

TI  - Working memory neurons in pigeons.
PG  - RC210
AB  - Working memory, the ability to temporarily store and manipulate currently
      relevant information, is required for most cognitive faculties. In humans and
      other mammals, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) provides the underlying neural network
      for these processes. Within the PFC, working memory neurons display sustained
      elevated activity while holding active an internal representation of the relevant
      stimulus during its physical absence or retaining a motor plan for the
      forthcoming response. Working memory, however, is not a hallmark of higher
      vertebrates endowed with a neocortex. Birds also master complex cognitive
      problems invoking working memory, but they lack a laminated neocortex. Behavioral
      studies in pigeons show that the neostriatum caudolaterale (NCL) plays a central 
      role in executive functions, such as working memory and response control. For
      neurons in the NCL of pigeons, we show activity changes during the delay of a
      working memory task, which were similar to those observed in PFC neurons and were
      related to the successful holding of information in memory and to the subsequent 
      behavior. Thus, although the anatomical and morphological structure of the
      neuronal substrate in birds is radically different from the mammalian neocortical
      architecture, the neuronal mechanisms evolved to master equivalent cognitive
      demands seem to be very similar.

TI  - Prefrontal contributions to executive control: fMRI evidence for functional
      distinctions within lateral Prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 1337-47
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a fundamental role in internally guided
      behavior. Although it is generally accepted that PFC subserves working memory and
      executive control operations, it remains unclear whether the subregions within
      lateral PFC support distinct executive control processes. An event-related fMRI
      study was implemented to test the hypothesis that ventrolateral and dorsolateral 
      PFC are functionally distinct, as well as to assess whether functional
      specialization exists within ventrolateral PFC. Participants performed two
      executive control tasks that differed in the types of control processes required.
      During rote rehearsal, participants covertly rehearsed three words in the order
      presented, thus requiring phonological access and maintenance. During elaborative
      rehearsal, participants made semantic comparisons between three words held in
      working memory, reordering them from least to most desirable. Thus, in addition
      to maintenance, elaborative rehearsal required goal-relevant coding of items in
      working memory ("monitoring") and selection from among the items to implement
      their reordering. Results revealed that left posterior ventrolateral PFC was
      active during performance of both tasks, whereas right dorsolateral PFC was
      differentially engaged during elaborative rehearsal. The temporal characteristics
      of the hemodynamic responses further suggested that dorsolateral activation
      lagged ventrolateral activation. Finally, differential activation patterns were
      observed within left ventrolateral PFC, distinguishing between posterior and
      anterior regions. These data suggest that anatomically separable subregions
      within lateral PFC may be functionally distinct and are consistent with models
      that posit a hierarchical relationship between dorsolateral and ventrolateral
      regions such that the former monitors and selects goal-relevant representations
      being maintained by the latter.

TI  - Control of semantic interference in episodic memory retrieval is associated with 
      an anterior cingulate-prefrontal activation pattern.
PG  - 94-103
AB  - Prefrontal activation is a consistent finding in functional neuroimaging studies 
      of episodic memory retrieval. In the present study we aimed at a further analysis
      of prefrontal neural systems involved in the executive control of
      context-specific properties in episodic memory retrieval using an event-related
      fMRI design. Nine subjects were asked to learn two 20-item word lists that
      consisted of concrete nouns assigned to four semantic categories. Ten items of
      both word lists referred to the same semantic category. Subjects were instructed 
      to determine whether nouns displayed in random order corresponded to the first
      20-item target list. The interference evoked by the retrieval of semantically
      related items of the second list resulted in significantly longer reaction times 
      compared to the noninterference condition. Contrasting the interference against
      the noninterference retrieval condition demonstrated an activation pattern that
      comprised a right anterior cingulate and frontal opercular area and a
      left-lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal region. Trial averaged time series
      revealed that the PFC areas were selectively activated at the interference
      condition and did not respond to the familiarity of learned words. These findings
      suggest a functionally separable role of prefrontal cortical areas mediating
      processes associated with the executive control of interfering context
      information in episodic memory retrieval.

TI  - The effects of local application of D2 selective dopaminergic drugs into the
      medial prefrontal cortex of rats in a delayed spatial choice task.
PG  - 99-111
AB  - The study examined the effects of modulation of dopamine D2 receptors-mediated
      neurotransmission in the rat's prefrontal cortex (PFC) on storage and executive
      components of working memory. Rats were trained on delayed (delay interval, 3 s) 
      and non-delayed choice in a U-maze. The prominence of proactive interference was 
      evaluated by sorting errors in a current trial on the basis of animal reactions
      in a preceding trial. The erroneous runs to the same arm of the maze as in the
      previous trial were identified as the repetitions (RE) and the erroneous runs to 
      the other arm in comparison with the previous trial were classified as
      alternations (AE). The bilateral microinfusion of D2 agonists PPHT (0.004 microg,
      0.04 microg, 0.4 microg/1 microl) into medial wall of the PFC produced a
      dose-dependent increase in the error rate of the delayed-response task and did
      not influence non-delayed choice. In delay condition PPHT enhanced the
      perseverative tendencies (the rate of RE was significantly higher than the rate
      of AE), in non-delayed choice the erroneous performance was mainly represented by
      AE. In contrast, the infusion of D2-receptor antagonist sulpiride (0.03 microg,
      0.3 microg, 3 microg/1 microl) increased the accuracy of delayed choice and
      changed the mode of intertrial dependence-rats made significantly more AE than
      RE. The results are discussed in terms of the involvement of D2 receptor
      dependent transmission of the PFC in different cognitive processes related to the
      delayed performance in U-maze (within-trial short-term storage of information
      versus dynamic control of between-trials working memory processing).

TI  - The dependence of span and delayed-response performance on prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 1303-15
AB  - Theoretical and empirical research on the cognitive functions of the prefrontal
      cortex have established that this region mediates what have been called
      'executive' processes that can influence working and long-term memory. Despite
      the accumulation of such empirical evidence, the dependence of purely mnemonic
      portions of memory tasks on PFC remains unresolved. To address this issue, we
      performed an analysis of reports of performance on tests of working memory of
      patients with lesions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, focusing on
      published reports in the literature of simple span and delayed-response tasks. We
      found that none of the eleven studies of forward verbal and spatial span in
      patients with prefrontal cortical lesions that we reviewed (reflecting the
      performance of 166 individual patients) demonstrated a statistically significant 
      deficit relative to normal controls. In contrast, our review of the
      delayed-response literature indicated that there are conditions under which PFC
      lesions disrupt delayed-response performance. Based on the results of our review 
      of the literature, we present testable hypotheses about the working memory
      functions of the PFC.

TI  - Pharmacologic strategies for augmenting cognitive performance in schizophrenia.
PG  - 1-16
AB  - There is recognition that the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia have the most
      substantial impact on illness outcome. Domains of cognition reported to be
      significantly affected include serial learning, executive function, vigilance,
      and distractibility, to name a few. Dopamine activity at D1 receptors mediates
      many cognitive processes subserved by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly
      working memory. The number of D1 receptors in the PFC is decreased in
      schizophrenics and is unaffected by chronic administration of typical
      neuroleptics. Therefore, medications that increase dopamine in the PFC, such as
      atypical neuroleptics, or that directly activate the D1 receptor may prove useful
      in the remediation of prefrontal-dependent cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.
      Decreased levels of cortical norepinephrine (NE) are associated with impaired
      learning and working memory in animal models, and can be reversed by drugs that
      restore NE activity. More specifically, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists have
      been particularly effective in improving delayed response performance in young
      monkeys with localized 6-hydroxydopamine lesions in the PFC. Furthermore, human
      postmortem studies have demonstrated decreased NE in the frontal cortex of
      demented schizophrenic patients. Therefore, alpha-2 receptor agonists hold
      promise as drugs to improve cognitive performance on tasks dependent upon PFC
      function in schizophrenics. Finally, the finding that cortical choline acetyl
      transferase activity correlates with Clinical Dementia Rating scores in
      schizophrenic patients and that cholinomimetic drugs enhance cognition in healthy
      subjects suggests that cholinergic drugs may also treat cognitive symptoms in
      schizophrenia. Two potential types of cholinomimetics for use in schizophrenics
      are the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and M1/M4 muscarinic agonists, both of
      which increase cortical cholinergic activity.

TI  - The functional roles of prefrontal cortex in episodic memory. I. Encoding.
PG  - 1239-48
AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies of episodic memory consistently report an
      association between memory encoding operations and left prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      activation. Encoding-related activation has been described in dorsolateral,
      ventrolateral and anterior prefrontal regions. We tested the hypothesis that a
      specific component of this left PFC activation reflects organizational processes 
      necessary for optimal memory encoding. Subjects underwent PET scans while
      learning auditorily presented word lists under dual task conditions. The degree
      to which they were required to organize word lists semantically was
      systematically varied across three experimental conditions. A task in which words
      were already organized produced the least degree of left PFC activity whereas a
      task requiring subjects to generate an organizational structure was associated
      with maximal activity in this region. This activation was localized to a region
      just above the inferior frontal sulcus. The functional specificity of this
      increased activity for organizational processes was tested using a concurrent
      distracting task known to disrupt these processes. Distraction resulted in a
      significant attenuation of this activation during the task emphasizing
      organizational processes but not other encoding tasks. In contrast, the
      distraction task resulted in reduced activity in a more ventral/anterior PFC
      region expressed equally for all memory tasks. The findings indicate that a key
      function of left dorsolateral PFC at encoding relates specifically to the use of 
      executive processes necessary for the creation of an organizational structure.
      Activity in more ventral and anterior left PFC regions would appear to reflect a 
      less specific component of episodic memory encoding.

TI  - D1 receptor modulation of hippocampal-prefrontal cortical circuits integrating
      spatial memory with executive functions in the rat.
PG  - 1613-21
AB  - Dopamine (DA) within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important role in
      modulating the short-term retention of information during working memory tasks.
      In contrast, little is known about the role of DA in modulating other executive
      aspects of working memory such as the use of short-term memory to guide action.
      The present study examined the effects of D1 and D2 receptor blockade in the PFC 
      on foraging by rats on a radial arm maze under two task conditions: (1) a delayed
      task in which spatial information acquired during a training phase was used 30
      min later to guide prospective responses, and (2) a nondelayed task that was
      identical to the test phase of the delayed task but lacked a training phase,
      thereby depriving rats of previous information about the location of food on the 
      maze. In experiment 1, microinjections of the D1 antagonist SCH-23390 (0.05, 0.5,
      or 5 microg/&microl), but not the D2 antagonist sulpiride (0.05, 0.5, or 5
      microg/microl), into the prelimbic region of the PFC before the test phase
      disrupted performance of the delayed task without affecting response latencies.
      In contrast, neither drug affected performance of the nondelayed task. In the
      present study, we also investigated the role of D1 receptors in modulating
      activity in hippocampal-PFC circuits during delayed responding. Unilateral
      injections of SCH-23390 into the PFC in the hemisphere contralateral to a
      microinjection of lidocaine into the hippocampus severely disrupted performance
      of the delayed task. Thus, the ability to use previously acquired spatial
      information to guide responding 30 min later on a radial arm maze requires D1
      receptor activation in the PFC and D1 receptor modulation of hippocampal inputs
      to the PFC. These data suggest that D1 receptors in the PFC are involved in
      working memory processes other than just the short-term active retention of
      information and also provide direct evidence for DA modulation of limbic-PFC
      circuits during behavior.
