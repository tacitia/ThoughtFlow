TI  - Atypical Learning in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Functional Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging Study of Transitive Inference.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying impairments in
      generalizing learning shown by adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
      METHOD: A total of 21 high-functioning individuals with ASD aged 12 to 18 years, 
      and 23 gender-, IQ-, and age-matched adolescents with typical development (TYP), 
      completed a transitive inference (TI) task implemented using rapid event-related 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were trained on
      overlapping pairs in a stimulus hierarchy of colored ovals where A>B>C>D>E>F and 
      then tested on generalizing this training to new stimulus pairings (AF, BD, BE)
      in a "Big Game." Whole-brain univariate, region of interest, and functional
      connectivity analyses were used. RESULTS: During training, the TYP group
      exhibited increased recruitment of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas the group
      with ASD showed greater functional connectivity between the PFC and the anterior 
      cingulate cortex (ACC). Both groups recruited the hippocampus and caudate
      comparably; however, functional connectivity between these regions was positively
      associated with TI performance for only the group with ASD. During the Big Game, 
      the TYP group showed greater recruitment of the PFC, parietal cortex, and the
      ACC. Recruitment of these regions increased with age in the group with ASD.
      CONCLUSION: During TI, TYP individuals recruited cognitive control-related brain 
      regions implicated in mature problem solving/reasoning including the PFC,
      parietal cortex, and ACC, whereas the group with ASD showed functional
      connectivity of the hippocampus and the caudate that was associated with task
      performance. Failure to reliably engage cognitive control-related brain regions
      may produce less integrated flexible learning in individuals with ASD unless they
      are provided with task support that, in essence, provides them with cognitive
      control; however, this pattern may normalize with age.

TI  - Frontal Motor Cortex Activity During Reactive Control Is Associated With Past
      Suicidal Behavior in Recent-Onset Schizophrenia.
PG  - 363-70
LID - 10.1027/0227-5910/a000335 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicide is prevalent in schizophrenia (SZ), yet the neural system
      functions that confer suicide risk remain obscure. Circuits operated by the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) are altered in SZ, including those that support reactive 
      control, and PFC changes are observed in postmortem studies of heterogeneous
      suicide victims. AIMS: We tested whether history of suicide attempt is associated
      with altered frontal motor cortex activity during reactive control processes.
      METHOD: We evaluated 17 patients with recent onset of DSM-IV-TR-defined SZ using 
      the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and functional magnetic resonance
      imaging during Stroop task performance. Group-level regression models relating
      past suicidal behavior to frontal activation controlled for depression,
      psychosis, and impulsivity. RESULTS: Past suicidal behavior was associated with
      relatively higher activation in the left-hemisphere supplementary motor area
      (SMA), pre-SMA, premotor cortex, and dorsolateral PFC, all ipsilateral to the
      active primary motor cortex. CONCLUSION: This study provides unique evidence that
      suicidal behavior in patients with recent-onset SZ directly relates to frontal
      motor cortex activity during reactive control, in a pattern reciprocal to the
      relationship with proactive control found previously. Further work should address
      how frontal-based control functions change with risk over time, and their
      potential utility as a biomarker for interventions to mitigate suicide risk in
      SZ.

TI  - PSD-Zip70 Deficiency Causes Prefrontal Hypofunction Associated with Glutamatergic
      Synapse Maturation Defects by Dysregulation of Rap2 Activity.
PG  - 14327-40
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2349-15.2015 [doi]
AB  - Dysregulation of synapse formation and plasticity is closely related to the
      pathophysiology of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) is particularly important for executive functions such as working
      memory, cognition, and emotional control, which are impaired in the disorders.
      PSD-Zip70 (Lzts1/FEZ1) is a postsynaptic density (PSD) protein predominantly
      expressed in the frontal cortex, olfactory bulb, striatum, and hippocampus. Here 
      we found that PSD-Zip70 knock-out (PSD-Zip70KO) mice exhibit working memory and
      cognitive defects, and enhanced anxiety-like behaviors. These abnormal behaviors 
      are caused by impaired glutamatergic synapse transmission accompanied by
      tiny-headed immature dendritic spines in the PFC, due to aberrant Rap2
      activation, which has roles in synapse formation and plasticity. PSD-Zip70
      modulates the Rap2 activity by interacting with SPAR (spine-associated RapGAP)
      and PDZ-GEF1 (RapGEF) in the postsynapse. Furthermore, suppression of the
      aberrant Rap2 activation in the PFC rescued the behavioral defects in PSD-Zip70KO
      mice. Our data demonstrate a critical role for PSD-Zip70 in Rap2-dependent spine 
      synapse development in the PFC and underscore the importance of this regulation
      in PFC-dependent behaviors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: PSD-Zip70 deficiency causes
      behavioral defects in working memory and cognition, and enhanced anxiety due to
      prefrontal hypofunction. This study revealed that PSD-Zip70 plays essential roles
      in glutamatergic synapse maturation via modulation of the Rap2 activity in the
      PFC. PSD-Zip70 interacts with both SPAR (spine-associated RapGAP) and PDZ-GEF1
      (RapGEF) and modulates the Rap2 activity in postsynaptic sites. Our results
      provide a novel Rap2-specific regulatory mechanism in synaptic maturation
      involving PSD-Zip70.

TI  - Skill acquisition and stress adaptations following laparoscopic surgery training 
      and detraining in novice surgeons.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical training and practice is stressful, but adaptive changes in 
      the stress circuitry (e.g. perceptual, physiological, hormonal, neural) could
      support skill development. This work examined skill acquisition and stress
      adaptations in novice surgeons during laparoscopic surgery (LS) training and
      detraining. METHODS: Twelve medical students were assessed for skill performance 
      after 2 h (BASE), 5 h (MID) and 8 h (POST) of LS training in weeks 1-3, and then 
      after 4 weeks of no training (RETEST). The stress outcomes included state
      anxiety, perceived stress and workload, heart rate (HR), heart rate variability
      (HRV), and salivary testosterone and cortisol concentrations. Functional
      near-infrared spectroscopy was used to assess cortical oxygenation change, as a
      marker of prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. RESULTS: Skill performance improved
      in every session from BASE (p < 0.01), with corresponding decreases in state
      anxiety, stress, workload, low- and high-frequency HRV in the MID, POST and/or
      RETEST sessions (p < 0.05). Left and right PFC were symmetrically activated
      within each testing session (p < 0.01). The stress and workload measures
      predicted skill performance and changes over time (p < 0.05), with state anxiety,
      mean HR and the HRV measures also showing some predictive potential (p < 0.10).
      CONCLUSIONS: A 3-week LS training programme promoted stress-related adaptations
      likely to directly, or indirectly, support the acquisition of new surgical
      skills, and many outcomes were retained after a 4-week period without further LS 
      training. These results have implications for medical training and education
      (e.g. distributed training for skill development and maintenance, stress resource
      and management training) and highlighted possible areas for new research (e.g.
      longitudinal stress and skill profiling).

TI  - Vocal response inhibition is enhanced by anodal tDCS over the right prefrontal
      cortex.
AB  - Stopping outright (reactive inhibition) and slowing down (proactive inhibition)
      are types of response inhibition which have mainly been investigated in the
      manual effector system. This study compared reactive inhibition across manual and
      vocal effector systems, examined the effects of excitatory anodal transcranial
      direct current stimulation (anodal tDCS) over the right prefrontal cortex
      (right-PFC) and looked at the relationship between reactive and proactive
      inhibition. We hypothesised (1) that vocal reactive inhibition would be less
      effective than manual reactive inhibition as evidenced by longer stop signal
      reaction times; (2) that anodal tDCS would enhance both vocal and manual reactive
      inhibitions and (3) that proactive and reactive inhibitions would be positively
      related. We tested 14 participants over two sessions (one session with anodal
      tDCS and one session with sham stimulation) and applied stimulation protocol in
      the middle of the session, i.e. only during the second of three phases. We used a
      stop signal task across two stop conditions: relevant and irrelevant stop
      conditions in which stopping was required or ignored, respectively. We found that
      reactive inhibition was faster during and immediately after anodal tDCS relative 
      to sham. We also found that greater level of proactive inhibition enhanced
      reactive inhibition (indexed by shorter stop signal reaction times). These
      results support the hypothesis that the right-PFC is part of a core network for
      reactive inhibition and supports previous contention that proactive inhibition is
      possibly modulated via preactivating the reactive inhibition network.

TI  - Decoding Episodic Retrieval Processes: Frontoparietal and Medial-temporal Lobe
      Contributions to Free Recall.
PG  - 1-15
AB  - Neuroimaging studies of recognition memory have identified distinct patterns of
      cortical activity associated with two sets of cognitive processes: Recollective
      processes supporting retrieval of information specifying a probe item's original 
      source are associated with the posterior hippocampus, ventral posterior parietal 
      cortex, and medial pFC. Familiarity processes supporting the correct
      identification of previously studied probes (in the absence of a recollective
      response) are associated with activity in anterior medial-temporal lobe (MTL)
      structures including the perirhinal cortex and anterior hippocampus, in addition 
      to lateral prefrontal and dorsal posterior parietal cortex. Here, we address an
      open question in the cognitive neuroscientific literature: To what extent are
      these same neurocognitive processes engaged during an internally directed memory 
      search task like free recall? We recorded fMRI activity while participants
      performed a series of free recall and source recognition trials, and we used a
      combination of univariate and multivariate analysis techniques to compare neural 
      activation profiles across the two tasks. Univariate analyses showed that
      posterior MTL regions were commonly associated with recollective processes during
      source recognition and with free recall responses. Prefrontal and posterior
      parietal regions were commonly associated with familiarity processes and free
      recall responses, whereas anterior MTL regions were only associated with
      familiarity processes during recognition. In contrast with the univariate
      results, free recall activity patterns characterized using multivariate pattern
      analysis did not reliably match the neural patterns associated with recollective 
      processes. However, these free recall patterns did reliably match patterns
      associated with familiarity processes, supporting theories of memory in which
      common cognitive mechanisms support both item recognition and free recall.

      Compression Technique Reduces Pancreatic Fistula.
PG  - 821-5
LID - 10.1089/lap.2015.0200 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic fistula (PF) is a common postoperative complication
      following distal pancreatectomy. The prolonged prefiring compression (PFC)
      technique to reduce PF has been described by Nakamura and colleagues in Japan.
      The present study assessed if this technique can be applied to the United Kingdom
      patient population in a tertiary referral center and replicate the low incidence 
      of PF after the laparoscopic approach to distal pancreatectomy (Lap-DP).
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of all patients who
      underwent Lap-DP using the modified PFC technique by the senior author between
      June 2011 and July 2014. The modified PFC technique involved compression of the
      pancreatic parenchyma with an endo-stapler for a 3-minute period prior to firing 
      and further 1-minute compression after firing prior to removal of the stapler,
      which is a small variant to the original technique of maintaining a 2-minute
      compression post firing. RESULTS: Twenty patients (15 females; median age, 66
      [range, 25-77] years) underwent Lap-DP using the PFC technique during the study
      period. Six patients had splenic-preserving Lap-DP. Median operating time was 240
      minutes (range, 150-420 minutes) with a median length of hospital stay of 6 days 
      (range, 3-22 days). Six patients (30%) developed Type A (biochemically noted as
      high drain fluid amylase) PF, and none of the patients had Type B/C PF. In the
      splenic preservation group, 1 patient had complete splenic infarction requiring
      laparoscopic splenectomy on Day 3, and 1 patient had partial infarction requiring
      prolonged hospital stay for pain relief. One patient required prolonged
      respiratory support due to severe preexisting lung disease. Overall mortality was
      zero. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that the PFC technique is safe, feasible, and
      effective in reducing clinically significant PF post-Lap-DP in the United Kingdom
      patient population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Suicide is highly-prevalent in major mood disorders, yet it remains
      unclear how suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior relate to brain functions,
      especially those that support control processes. We evaluated how prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) activity during goal-representation (an important component of
      cognitive control) relates to past suicidal ideation and behavior in patients
      with psychotic major mood disorders. METHOD: 30 patients with recent-onset of
      either DSM-IV-TR-defined bipolar disorder type I (n=21) or major depressive
      disorder (n=9) with psychotic features, but neither in a major mood episode nor
      acutely psychotic at study, were evaluated for past suicidal ideation and
      behavior (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale) and functional MRI during
      cognitive control task performance. Group-level regression models of brain
      activation accounted for current depression, psychosis and trait impulsivity.
      RESULTS: Intensity of past suicidal ideation was associated with higher
      control-related activation in right-hemisphere regions including the
      ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex, rostral insula, and dorsal
      striatum. Among those with past suicidal ideation (n=16), past suicidal behavior 
      (n=8) was associated with higher control-related activation in right-hemisphere
      regions including VLPFC, rostrolateral PFC, and frontal operculum/rostral insula;
      and relatively lower activity in midline parietal regions, including cuneus and
      precuneus. LIMITATIONS: The sample size of subjects with past suicidal behavior
      was modest, and all subjects were taking psychotropic medication. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study provides unique evidence that in early-course psychotic major mood
      disorders, suicidal ideation and behavior histories directly relate to PFC-based 
      circuit function in support of cognitive control.

AB  - One of the remaining challenges in functional connectivity (FC) studies is
      investigation of the temporal variability of FC networks. Recent studies focusing
      on the dynamic FC mostly use functional magnetic resonance imaging as an imaging 
      tool to investigate the temporal variability of FC. We attempted to quantify this
      variability via analyzing the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
      signals, which were recorded from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 12 healthy
      subjects during a Stroop test. Mutual information was used as a metric to
      determine functional connectivity between PFC regions. Two-dimensional
      correlation based similarity measure was used as a method to analyze
      within-subject and intersubject consistency of FC maps and how they change in
      time. We found that within-subject consistency (0.61+/-0.09 ) is higher than
      intersubject consistency (0.28+/-0.13 ). Within-subject consistency was not found
      to be task-specific. Results also revealed that there is a gradual change in FC
      patterns during a Stroop session for congruent and neutral conditions, where
      there is no such trend in the presence of an interference effect. In conclusion, 
      we have demonstrated the between-subject, within-subject, and temporal
      variability of FC and the feasibility of using fNIRS for studying dynamic FC.

TI  - The Neural Bases of the Semantic Interference of Spatial Frequency-based
      Information in Scenes.
PG  - 2394-405
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00861 [doi]
AB  - Current models of visual perception suggest that during scene categorization, low
      spatial frequencies (LSF) are processed rapidly and activate plausible
      interpretations of visual input. This coarse analysis would then be used to guide
      subsequent processing of high spatial frequencies (HSF). The present fMRI study
      examined how processing of LSF may influence that of HSF by investigating the
      neural bases of the semantic interference effect. We used hybrid scenes as
      stimuli by combining LSF and HSF from two different scenes, and participants had 
      to categorize the HSF scene. Categorization was impaired when LSF and HSF scenes 
      were semantically dissimilar, suggesting that the LSF scene was processed
      automatically and interfered with categorization of the HSF scene. fMRI results
      revealed that this semantic interference effect was associated with increased
      activation in the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior parietal lobules, and the 
      fusiform and parahippocampal gyri. Furthermore, a connectivity analysis
      (psychophysiological interaction) revealed that the semantic interference effect 
      resulted in increasing connectivity between the right fusiform and the right
      inferior frontal gyri. Results support influential models suggesting that, during
      scene categorization, LSF information is processed rapidly in the pFC and
      activates plausible interpretations of the scene category. These coarse
      predictions would then initiate top-down influences on recognition-related areas 
      of the inferotemporal cortex, and these could interfere with the categorization
      of HSF information in case of semantic dissimilarity to LSF.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Suicide occurs in some, but not all depressed patients. So far, it
      remains unknown whether the studied stress-related candidate genes change in
      depression, suicide or both. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in, among
      other things, impulse control and inhibitory behavior and plays an important role
      in both suicide and depression. METHODS: We have employed qPCR to study 124
      anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) brain samples,
      obtained from two brain banks, from: i) young depressed patients (average age 43 
      years) who committed suicide (MDD-S) and depressed patients who died from causes 
      other than suicide (MDD-NS) and from ii) elderly depressed patients (average age 
      75 years) who did not commit suicide (DEP). Both cohorts were individually
      matched with non-psychiatric non-suicide control subjects. We determined the
      transcript levels of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis-regulating molecules
      (corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), CRH receptors, CRH binding protein,
      mineralocorticoid receptor/glucocorticoid receptor), transcription factors that
      regulate CRH expression, CRH-stimulating cytokines, chaperone proteins, retinoid 
      signaling, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tropomyosin-related kinase B,
      cytochrome proteins, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and monoamines. RESULTS: In the 
      MDD-S group, expression levels of CRH and neuronal NOS-interacting DHHC
      domain-containing protein with dendritic mRNA (NIDD) were increased. Other
      changes were only present in the DEP group, i.e. decreased NIDD, and increased
      and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (5-HT1A) expression levels. Changes were
      found to be more pronounced in the anterior cingulate cortex than in the
      dorsolateral PFC. CONCLUSION: Depressed patients who committed suicide have
      different gene expression patterns than depressed patients who died of causes
      other than suicide.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-associated neurocognitive
      disorders (HAND) are characterized by synaptic damage and neuronal loss in the
      brain. Excessive glutamatergic transmission and loss of cholinergic neurons are
      the major indicators of HAND. Nicotine acts as a cholinergic channel modulator,
      and its cognitive-enhancing effect in neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders
      has been documented. However, it is unclear whether nicotine has any positive
      effect on memory and synaptic plasticity formation in HAND. METHODS: We
      investigated the effects of nicotine on synaptic plasticity and
      hippocampus-prefrontal cortex (PFC)-amygdala-dependent memory formation in the
      HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) and F344 control rats. RESULTS: Chronic nicotine treatment 
      (0.4 mg/kg nicotine, base, subcutaneously) significantly attenuated the cognitive
      deficits in the HIV-1Tg rats in both the spatial and contextual fear memories but
      impaired the contextual learning memory in the F344 rats. To determine the role
      of nicotine in the synaptic dysfunction caused by HIV-1 proteins, we analyzed the
      expression of key representative genes related to synaptic plasticity in the
      hippocampus, PFC, and amygdala of the HIV-1Tg and F344 rats using a
      custom-designed qRT-PCR array. The HIV-1 proteins significantly altered the
      glutamate receptor-mediated intracellular calcium cascade and its downstream
      signaling cascade in a brain region-specific manner. Further, chronic nicotine
      treatment reversed the effect of HIV-1 proteins on the expression of genes
      involved in synaptic plasticity in the three brain regions. The effects of
      nicotine differed significantly in the HIV-1Tg and F344 rats. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      findings indicate that nicotine can attenuate the effect of HIV viral proteins on
      cognitive function and produce a brain region- and strain-specific effect on the 
      intracellular signaling cascades involved in synaptic plasticity and memory
      formation.

      Emotional Responses.
PG  - 10503-9
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0569-15.2015 [doi]
AB  - Failure to sustain positive affect over time is a hallmark of depression and
      other psychopathologies, but the mechanisms supporting the ability to sustain
      positive emotional responses are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the
      neural correlates associated with the persistence of positive affect in the real 
      world by conducting two experiments in humans: an fMRI task of reward responses
      and an experience-sampling task measuring emotional responses to a reward
      obtained in the field. The magnitude of DLPFC engagement to rewards administered 
      in the laboratory predicted reactivity of real-world positive emotion following a
      reward administered in the field. Sustained ventral striatum engagement in the
      laboratory positively predicted the duration of real-world positive emotional
      responses. These results suggest that common pathways are associated with the
      unfolding of neural processes over seconds and with the dynamics of emotions
      experienced over minutes. Examining such dynamics may facilitate a better
      understanding of the brain-behavior associations underlying emotion. Significance
      statement: How real-world emotion, experienced over seconds, minutes, and hours, 
      is instantiated in the brain over the course of milliseconds and seconds is
      unknown. We combined a novel, real-world experience-sampling task with fMRI to
      examine how individual differences in real-world emotion, experienced over
      minutes and hours, is subserved by affective neurodynamics of brain activity over
      the course of seconds. When winning money in the real world, individuals
      sustaining positive emotion the longest were those with the most prolonged
      ventral striatal activity. These results suggest that common pathways are
      associated with the unfolding of neural processes over seconds and with the
      dynamics of emotions experienced over minutes. Examining such dynamics may
      facilitate a better understanding of the brain-behavior associations underlying
      emotion.

TI  - Functional and Neuroanatomic Specificity of Episodic Memory Dysfunction in
      Schizophrenia: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of the Relational
      and Item-Specific Encoding Task.
PG  - 909-16
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0276 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Individuals with schizophrenia can encode item-specific information
      to support familiarity-based recognition but are disproportionately impaired
      encoding interitem relationships (relational encoding) and recollecting
      information. The Relational and Item-Specific Encoding (RiSE) paradigm has been
      used to disentangle these encoding and retrieval processes, which may depend on
      specific medial temporal lobe (MTL) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) subregions.
      Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging during RiSE task performance could
      help to specify dysfunctional neural circuits in schizophrenia that can be
      targeted for interventions to improve memory and functioning in the illness.
      OBJECTIVES: To use fMRI to test the hypothesis that schizophrenia
      disproportionately affects MTL and PFC subregions during relational encoding and 
      retrieval relative to item-specific memory processes, and to use fMRI results
      from healthy individuals serving as controls to establish neural construct
      validity for RiSE. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multisite,
      case-control, cross-sectional fMRI study was conducted between November 1, 2010, 
      and May 30, 2012, at 5 Cognitive Neuroscience Test Reliability and Clinical
      Applications for Schizophrenia sites. The final sample included 52 outpatients
      with clinically stable schizophrenia and 57 demographically matched healthy
      control participants. Data analysis was performed between February 1, 2013, and
      May 30, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Behavioral performance speed and
      accuracy (d') on item recognition and associative recognition tasks. Voxelwise
      statistical parametric maps for a priori MTL and PFC regions of interest to test 
      activation differences between relational and item-specific memory during
      encoding and retrieval. RESULTS: Item recognition was disproportionately impaired
      in patients with schizophrenia relative to healthy control participants following
      relational encoding (F1,107 = 4.7; P = .03). The differential deficit was
      accompanied by reduced dorsolateral PFC activation during relational encoding in 
      patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy control participants (z > 2.3; 
      P < .05 corrected). Retrieval success (hits > misses) was associated with
      hippocampal activation in healthy control participants during relational item
      recognition and associative recognition conditions, and hippocampal activation
      was specifically reduced in schizophrenia for recognition of relational but not
      item-specific information (z > 2.3; P < .05 corrected). CONCLUSIONS AND
      RELEVANCE: In this unique, multisite fMRI study, results in the healthy control
      group supported RiSE construct validity by revealing expected memory effects in
      PFC and MTL subregions during encoding and retrieval. Comparison of schizophrenic
      and healthy control participants revealed disproportionate memory deficits in
      schizophrenia for relational vs item-specific information, accompanied by
      regionally and functionally specific deficits in dorsolateral PFC and hippocampal
      activation.

TI  - Decreased neural activity and neural connectivity while performing a set-shifting
      task after inhibiting repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on the left
      dorsal prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1186/s12868-015-0181-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sub-optimal functioning of the dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC) is
      associated with executive dysfunction, such as set-shifting deficits, in
      neurological and psychiatric disorders. We tested this hypothesis by
      investigating the effect of low-frequency 'inhibiting' off-line repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the left dorsal prefrontal cortex on 
      behavioural performance, neural activity, and network connectivity during the
      performance of a set-shifting paradigm in healthy elderly (mean age 50+).
      RESULTS: Behaviorally, we found a group-by-session interaction for errors on
      set-shift trials, although post hoc tests did not yield significant findings. In 
      addition, the verum group, when compared with the sham group, displayed reduced
      task-related activity in the left temporal gyrus, and reduced task-related
      connectivity of the left PFC with the left postcentral gyrus and posterior
      insula. CONCLUSION: These results show that low-frequency off-line rTMS on the
      left dorsal PFC resulted in reduced task-related activity and network
      connectivity, which was accompanied by a subtle behavioural effect, thereby
      further corroborating the importance of an optimally functioning PFC in
      set-shifting.

TI  - Prefrontal neurons encode context-based response execution and inhibition in
      reward seeking and extinction.
PG  - 9472-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1507611112 [doi]
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) guides execution and inhibition of behavior based on 
      contextual demands. In rodents, the dorsal/prelimbic (PL) medial PFC (mPFC) is
      frequently considered essential for execution of goal-directed behavior ("go")
      whereas ventral/infralimbic (IL) mPFC is thought to control behavioral
      suppression ("stop"). This dichotomy is commonly seen for fear-related behaviors,
      and for some behaviors related to cocaine seeking. Overall, however, data for
      reward-directed behaviors are ambiguous, and few recordings of PL/IL activity
      have been performed to demonstrate single-neuron correlates. We recorded neuronal
      activity in PL and IL during discriminative stimulus driven sucrose seeking
      followed by multiple days of extinction of the reward-predicting stimulus.
      Contrary to a generalized PL-go/IL-stop hypothesis, we found cue-evoked activity 
      in PL and IL during reward seeking and extinction. Upon analyzing this activity
      based on resultant behavior (lever press or withhold), we found that neurons in
      both areas encoded contextually appropriate behavioral initiation (during reward 
      seeking) and withholding (during extinction), where context was dictated by
      response-outcome contingencies. Our results demonstrate that PL and IL signal
      contextual information for regulation of behavior, irrespective of whether that
      involves initiation or suppression of behavioral responses, rather than
      topographically encoding go vs. stop behaviors. The use of context to optimize
      behavior likely plays an important role in maximizing utility-promoting exertion 
      of activity when behaviors are rewarded and conservation of energy when not.

TI  - Early-life exposure to noise reduces mPFC astrocyte numbers and T-maze
      alternation/discrimination task performance in adult male rats.
PG  - 216-26
LID - 10.4103/1463-1741.160703 [doi]
AB  - In this experiment, we evaluated the long-term effects of noise by assessing both
      astrocyte changes in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and mPFC-related
      alternation/discrimination tasks. Twenty-one-day-old male rats were exposed
      during a period of 15 days to a standardized rats' audiogram-fitted adaptation of
      a human noisy environment. We measured serum corticosterone (CORT) levels at the 
      end of the exposure and periodically registered body weight gain. In order to
      evaluate the long-term effects of this exposure, we assessed the rats'
      performance on the T-maze apparatus 3 months later. Astrocyte numbers and
      proliferative changes in mPFC were also evaluated at this stage. We found that
      environmental noise (EN) exposure significantly increased serum CORT levels and
      negatively affected the body weight gain curve. Accordingly, enduring effects of 
      noise were demonstrated on mPFC. The ability to solve alternation/discrimination 
      tasks was reduced, as well as the number of astroglial cells. We also found
      reduced cytogenesis among the mPFC areas evaluated. Our results support the idea 
      that early exposure to environmental stressors may have long-lasting consequences
      affecting complex cognitive processes. These results also suggest that glial
      changes may become an important element behind the cognitive and morphological
      alterations accompanying the PFC changes seen in some stress-related pathologies.

TI  - Unique Effects of Acute Aripiprazole Treatment on the Dopamine D2 Receptor
      Downstream cAMP-PKA and Akt-GSK3beta Signalling Pathways in Rats.
PG  - e0132722
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0132722 [doi]
AB  - Aripiprazole is a wide-used antipsychotic drug with therapeutic effects on both
      positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and reduced side-effects.
      Although aripiprazole was developed as a dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) partial
      agonist, all other D2R partial agonists that aimed to mimic aripiprazole failed
      to exert therapeutic effects in clinic. The present in vivo study aimed to
      investigate the effects of aripiprazole on the D2R downstream cAMP-PKA and
      Akt-GSK3beta signalling pathways in comparison with a D2R antagonist--haloperidol
      and a D2R partial agonist--bifeprunox. Rats were injected once with aripiprazole 
      (0.75 mg/kg, i.p.), bifeprunox (0.8 mg/kg, i.p.), haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.)
      or vehicle. Five brain regions--the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens
      (NAc), caudate putamen (CPu), ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra
      (SN) were collected. The protein levels of PKA, Akt and GSK3beta were measured by
      Western Blotting; the cAMP levels were examined by ELISA tests. The results
      showed that aripiprazole presented similar acute effects on PKA expression to
      haloperidol, but not bifeprunox, in the CPU and VTA. Additionally, aripiprazole
      was able to increase the phosphorylation of GSK3beta in the PFC, NAc, CPu and SN,
      respectively, which cannot be achieved by bifeprunox and haloperidol. These
      results suggested that acute treatment of aripiprazole had differential effects
      on the cAMP-PKA and Akt-GSK3beta signalling pathways from haloperidol and
      bifeprunox in these brain areas. This study further indicated that, by comparison
      with bifeprunox, the unique pharmacological profile of aripiprazole may be
      attributed to the relatively lower intrinsic activity at D2R.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We recently demonstrated that epicardial progenitor cells participate
      in the regenerative response to myocardial infarction (MI) and factors released
      in the pericardial fluid (PF) may play a key role in this process. Exosomes are
      secreted nanovesicles of endocytic origin, identified in most body fluids, which 
      may contain molecules able to modulate a variety of cell functions. Here, we
      investigated whether exosomes are present in the PF and their potential role in
      cardiac repair. METHODS AND RESULTS: Early gene expression studies in
      3day-infarcted mouse hearts showed that PF induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT) in epicardial cells. Exosomes were identified in PFs from
      non-infarcted patients (PFC) and patients with acute MI (PFMI). A shotgun
      proteomics analysis identified clusterin in exosomes isolated from PFMI but not
      from PFC. Notably, clusterin has a protective effect on cardiomyocytes after
      acute MI in vivo and is an important mediator of TGFbeta-induced. Clusterin
      addition to the pericardial sac determined an increase in epicardial cells
      expressing the EMT marker alpha-SMA and, interestingly, an increase in the number
      of epicardial cells ckit(+)/alpha-SMA(+), 7days following MI. Importantly,
      clusterin treatment enhanced arteriolar length density and lowered apoptotic
      rates in the peri-infarct area. Hemodynamic studies demonstrated an improvement
      in cardiac function in clusterin-treated compared to untreated infarcted hearts. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes are present and detectable in the PFs. Clusterin was
      identified in PFMI-exosomes and might account for an improvement in myocardial
      performance following MI through a framework including EMT-mediated epicardial
      activation, arteriogenesis and reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

AB  - A diverse array of neuromodulators governs cellular function in the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) via the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, 
      these functionally diverse signals are carried and amplified by a relatively
      small assortment of intracellular second messengers. Here, we examine whether two
      distinct Galphai-coupled neuromodulators (norepinephrine and GABA) act as
      redundant regulators of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Our results reveal
      that, within single dendritic spines of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, alpha-2
      adrenergic receptors (alpha2Rs) selectively inhibit excitatory transmission
      mediated by AMPA-type glutamate receptors, while type B GABA receptors
      (GABA(B)Rs) inhibit NMDA-type receptors. We show that both modulators act via the
      downregulation of cAMP and PKA. However, by restricting the lifetime of active
      Galphai, RGS4 promotes the independent control of these two distinct target
      proteins. Our findings highlight a mechanism by which neuromodulatory
      microdomains can be established in subcellular compartments such as dendritic
      spines.

TI  - Prefrontal and Striatal Glutamate Differently Relate to Striatal Dopamine:
      Potential Regulatory Mechanisms of Striatal Presynaptic Dopamine Function?
PG  - 9615-21
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0329-15.2015 [doi]
AB  - Theoretical and animal work has proposed that prefrontal cortex (PFC) glutamate
      inhibits dopaminergic inputs to the ventral striatum (VS) indirectly, whereas
      direct VS glutamatergic afferents have been suggested to enhance dopaminergic
      inputs to the VS. In the present study, we aimed to investigate relationships of 
      glutamate and dopamine measures in prefrontostriatal circuitries of healthy
      humans. We hypothesized that PFC and VS glutamate, as well as their balance, are 
      differently associated with VS dopamine. Glutamate concentrations in the left
      lateral PFC and left striatum were assessed using 3-Tesla proton magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy. Striatal presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity was
      measured by fluorine-18-l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (F-18-FDOPA) positron emission
      tomography. First, a negative relationship was observed between glutamate
      concentrations in lateral PFC and VS dopamine synthesis capacity (n = 28).
      Second, a positive relationship was revealed between striatal glutamate and VS
      dopamine synthesis capacity (n = 26). Additionally, the intraindividual
      difference between PFC and striatal glutamate concentrations correlated
      negatively with VS dopamine synthesis capacity (n = 24). The present results
      indicate an involvement of a balance in PFC and striatal glutamate in the
      regulation of VS dopamine synthesis capacity. This notion points toward a
      potential mechanism how VS presynaptic dopamine levels are kept in a fine-tuned
      range. A disruption of this mechanism may account for alterations in striatal
      dopamine turnover as observed in mental diseases (e.g., in schizophrenia).
      SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The present work demonstrates complementary relationships
      between prefrontal and striatal glutamate and ventral striatal presynaptic
      dopamine using human imaging measures: a negative correlation between prefrontal 
      glutamate and presynaptic dopamine and a positive relationship between striatal
      glutamate and presynaptic dopamine are revealed. The results may reflect a
      regulatory role of prefrontal and striatal glutamate for ventral striatal
      presynaptic dopamine levels. Such glutamate-dopamine relationships improve our
      understanding of neurochemical interactions in prefrontostriatal circuits and
      have implications for the neurobiology of mental disease.

TI  - Dynamically Allocated Hub in Task-Evoked Network Predicts the Vulnerable
      Prefrontal Locus for Contextual Memory Retrieval in Macaques.
PG  - e1002177
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002177 [doi]
AB  - Neuroimaging and neurophysiology have revealed that multiple areas in the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) are activated in a specific memory task, but severity of 
      impairment after PFC lesions is largely different depending on which activated
      area is damaged. The critical relationship between lesion sites and impairments
      has not yet been given a clear mechanistic explanation. Although recent works
      proposed that a whole-brain network contains hubs that play integrative roles in 
      cortical information processing, this framework relying on an anatomy-based
      structural network cannot account for the vulnerable locus for a specific task,
      lesioning of which would bring impairment. Here, we hypothesized that (i)
      activated PFC areas dynamically form an ordered network centered at a
      task-specific "functional hub" and (ii) the lesion-effective site corresponds to 
      the "functional hub," but not to a task-invariant "structural hub." To test these
      hypotheses, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments in
      macaques performing a temporal contextual memory task. We found that the
      activated areas formed a hierarchical hub-centric network based on task-evoked
      directed connectivity, differently from the anatomical network reflecting axonal 
      projection patterns. Using a novel simulated-lesion method based on support
      vector machine, we estimated severity of impairment after lesioning of each area,
      which accorded well with a known dissociation in contextual memory impairment in 
      macaques (impairment after lesioning in area 9/46d, but not in area 8Ad). The
      predicted severity of impairment was proportional to the network "hubness" of the
      virtually lesioned area in the task-evoked directed connectivity network, rather 
      than in the anatomical network known from tracer studies. Our results suggest
      that PFC areas dynamically and cooperatively shape a functional hub-centric
      network to reallocate the lesion-effective site depending on the cognitive
      processes, apart from static anatomical hubs. These findings will be a foundation
      for precise prediction of behavioral impacts of damage or surgical intervention
      in human brains.

TI  - Operant ethanol self-administration increases extracellular-signal regulated
      protein kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in reward-related brain regions: selective
      regulation of positive reinforcement in the prefrontal cortex of C57BL/6J mice.
PG  - 3417-30
LID - 10.1007/s00213-015-3993-z [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Extracellular-signal regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) is activated by
      ethanol in reward-related brain regions. Accordingly, systemic inhibition of
      ERK1/2 potentiates ethanol reinforcement. However, the brain region(s) that
      mediate this effect are unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to pharmacologically 
      inhibit ERK1/2 in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAC),
      and amygdala (AMY) prior to ethanol or sucrose self-administration, and evaluate 
      effects of operant ethanol self-administration on ERK1/2 phosphorylation
      (pERK1/2). METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were trained to lever press on a
      fixed-ratio-4 schedule of 9% ethanol + 2% sucrose (ethanol) or 2% sucrose
      (sucrose) reinforcement. Mice were sacrificed immediately after the 30th
      self-administration session and pERK1/2 immunoreactivity was quantified in
      targeted brain regions. Additional groups of mice were injected with SL 327
      (0-1.7 mug/side) in PFC, NAC, or AMY prior to self-administration. RESULTS:
      pERK1/2 immunoreactivity was significantly increased by operant ethanol (g/kg =
      1.21 g/kg; BAC = 54.9 mg/dl) in the PFC, NAC (core and shell), and AMY (central
      nucleus) as compared to sucrose. Microinjection of SL 327 (1.7 mug) into the PFC 
      selectively increased ethanol self-administration. Intra-NAC injection of SL 327 
      had no effect on ethanol- but suppressed sucrose-reinforced responding. Intra-AMY
      microinjection of SL 327 had no effect on either ethanol- or sucrose-reinforced
      responding. Locomotor activity was unaffected under all conditions. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Operant ethanol self-administration increases pERK1/2 activation in the PFC, NAC,
      and AMY. However, ERK1/2 activity only in the PFC mechanistically regulates
      ethanol self-administration. These data suggest that ethanol-induced activation
      of ERK1/2 in the PFC is a critical pharmacological effect that mediates the
      reinforcing properties of the drug.

AB  - Schizophrenia patients exhibit deficits in signaling of the M1 subtype of
      muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and also
      display impaired cortical long-term depression (LTD). We report that selective
      activation of the M1 mAChR subtype induces LTD in PFC and that this response is
      completely lost after repeated administration of phencyclidine (PCP), a mouse
      model of schizophrenia. Furthermore, discovery of a novel, systemically active M1
      positive allosteric modulator (PAM), VU0453595, allowed us to evaluate the impact
      of selective potentiation of M1 on induction of LTD and behavioral deficits in
      PCP-treated mice. Interestingly, VU0453595 fully restored impaired LTD as well as
      deficits in cognitive function and social interaction in these mice. These
      results provide critical new insights into synaptic changes that may contribute
      to behavioral deficits in this mouse model and support a role for selective M1
      PAMs as a novel approach for the treatment of
      schizophrenia.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 15 July 2015;

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Theories of relative deprivation suggest African Americans in
      disadvantaged communities are at increased risk for drug use. This increased risk
      may be due, in part, to exposure to drugs and drug subcultures. Given the
      significance of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) functioning in yielding behavior that
      is strategically guided rather than reactive to environmental demands, it is
      important to examine the relationship between PFC functioning, neighborhood drug 
      activity and substance use among African Americans residing in high risk
      communities. METHODS: A sample of 120 young adult African American females was
      recruited from high-risk neighborhoods. Each completed the modified version of
      the neighborhood environment scale, a neurobehavioral assessment designed to
      measure apathy, behavioral disinhibition and executive dysfunction, and provided 
      a urine sample that was tested for the presence of psychoactive drugs. RESULTS:
      Logistic regression analyses indicated that females with higher scores on
      behavioral disinhibition were 2.6 times more likely to test positive for
      marijuana (95%CI = 1.02, 6.57). Neither apathy nor executive dysfunction was
      related to marijuana use. No relationship emerged between neighborhood drug
      activity and marijuana use. CONCLUSIONS: Among the neurobehavioral traits
      considered only behavioral disinhibition was associated with marijuana use,
      suggesting that different neurobehavioral domains may be uniquely related to
      marijuana use. For females living in high risk environments, the extent to which 
      they are able to control impulses may provide some protection against marijuana
      use. Future studies focused on the moderating effects of behavioral disinhibition
      on the association of exposure to risk environments and marijuana use may prove
      beneficial. Further, the study adds to the small base of literature supporting
      the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale as a brief assessment to evaluate
      frontally-mediated neurobehavioral traits relevant to substance use. However,
      future studies aimed at examining the influence of neighborhood drug activity
      might benefit from more precise measures of exposure to neighborhood drug
      activity. More research to replicate and expand on the present findings is
      warranted.

TI  - Monitoring the Stability of Perfluorocarbon Nanoemulsions by Cryo-TEM Image
      Analysis and Dynamic Light Scattering.
PG  - e0130674
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0130674 [doi]
AB  - Perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions (PFC-NE) are disperse systems consisting of
      nanoscale liquid perfluorocarbon droplets stabilized by an emulsifier, usually
      phospholipids. Perfluorocarbons are chemically inert and non-toxic substances
      that are exhaled after in vivo administration. The manufacture of PFC-NE can be
      done in large scales by means of high pressure homogenization or
      microfluidization. Originally investigated as oxygen carriers for cases of severe
      blood loss, their application nowadays is more focused on using them as marker
      agents in 19F Magnetic Resonance Imaging (19F MRI). 19F is scarce in organisms
      and thus PFC-NE are a promising tool for highly specific and non-invasive imaging
      of inflammation via 19F MRI. Neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages phagocytize
      PFC-NE and subsequently migrate to inflamed tissues. This technique has proven
      feasibility in numerous disease models in mice, rabbits and mini pigs. The
      translation to clinical trials in human needs the development of a stable
      nanoemulsion whose droplet size is well characterized over a long storage time.
      Usually dynamic light scattering (DLS) is applied as the standard method for
      determining particle sizes in the nanometer range. Our study uses a second
      method, analysis of transmission electron microscopy images of cryo-fixed samples
      (Cryo-TEM), to evaluate stability of PFC-NE in comparison to DLS. Four
      nanoemulsions of different composition are observed for one year. The results
      indicate that DLS alone cannot reveal the changes in particle size, but can even 
      mislead to a positive estimation of stability. The combination with Cryo-TEM
      images gives more insight in the particulate evolution, both techniques
      supporting one another. The study is one further step in the development of
      analytical tools for the evaluation of a clinically applicable
      perfluorooctylbromide nanoemulsion.

TI  - Neuregulin 1 Controls Glutamate Uptake by Up-regulating Excitatory Amino Acid
      Carrier 1 (EAAC1).
PG  - 20233-44
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M114.591867 [doi]
AB  - Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a trophic factor that is thought to have important roles
      in the regulating brain circuitry. Recent studies suggest that NRG1 regulates
      synaptic transmission, although the precise mechanisms remain unknown. Here we
      report that NRG1 influences glutamate uptake by increasing the protein level of
      excitatory amino acid carrier (EAAC1). Our data indicate that NRG1 induced the
      up-regulation of EAAC1 in primary cortical neurons with an increase in glutamate 
      uptake. These in vitro results were corroborated in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      of mice given NRG1. The stimulatory effect of NRG1 was blocked by inhibition of
      the NRG1 receptor ErbB4. The suppressed expression of ErbB4 by siRNA led to a
      decrease in the expression of EAAC1. In addition, the ablation of ErbB4 in
      parvalbumin (PV)-positive neurons in PV-ErbB4(-/-) mice suppressed EAAC1
      expression. Taken together, our results show that NRG1 signaling through ErbB4
      modulates EAAC1. These findings link proposed effectors in schizophrenia:
      NRG1/ErbB4 signaling perturbation, EAAC1 deficit, and neurotransmission
      dysfunction.

AB  - To study rapid sensorimotor remapping, we developed a method to train rats in a
      behavior in which subjects are cued, on each trial, to apply a sensorimotor
      association to orient either toward a visual target ("Pro") or away from it,
      toward its reverse ("Anti"). Multiple behavioral asymmetries suggested that Anti 
      behavior is cognitively demanding while Pro is easier to learn and perform. This 
      is consistent with a prominent hypothesis in the primate literature that Anti
      requires prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas Pro could be mediated by midbrain
      superior colliculus (SC). Pharmacological inactivation of rat medial PFC
      supported its expected role in Anti. Remarkably, bilateral SC inactivation
      substantially impaired Anti while leaving Pro essentially intact. Moreover, SC
      inactivation eliminated the performance cost of switching from Anti to Pro tasks.
      Our results establish a rodent model of single-trial sensorimotor remapping and
      suggest a critical role for SC in the cognitively demanding Anti task.

TI  - Chronic stress adaptation of the nitric oxide synthases and IL-1beta levels in
      brain structures and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity induced by
      homotypic stress.
PG  - 427-40
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of repeated restraint stress
      (RS) on a single restraint (homotypic) stress-induced expression of
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and inducible
      nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and
      hypothalamus and their adaptational changes in chronic stress. Also the
      involvement of plasma IL-1beta in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and
      corticosterone secretion during chronic stress was investigated. Rats were
      subjected to a single restraint for 10 minutes or restrained twice a day for 3, 7
      and 14 consecutive days and 24 hours after the last stress period rats were
      restrained for 10 min and rapidly decapitated 0, 1, 2 and 3 hours later. The
      IL-1beta, nNOS and iNOS protein levels in brain structures samples were analyzed 
      by Western blot procedure and IL-1beta, ACTH and corticosterone levels were
      determined in plasma. Single restraint induced a strongest decrease of iNOS
      protein levels (1-3 h) in the PFC and a weaker decline in the hippocampus and
      hypothalamus (3 h) after stress cessation. Single restraint markedly increased
      IL-1beta protein level in PFC and hippocampus. In the PFC repeated restraint for 
      3 days significantly increased the homotypic stress induced iNOS and IL-1beta
      protein levels and this increase gradually declined after 7 and 14 days of
      repeated restraint. Much weaker yet a parallel changes appeared with neuronal NOS
      level. In the hippocampus prior stress for 3, 7 and 14 days significantly
      increased the homotypic stress induced iNOS protein level parallel with IL-1beta 
      level which gradually declined with prolonged period of repeated restraint. In
      the hippocampus a longer restraint period, 7 and 14 days markedly decreased nNOS 
      protein level evoked by homotypic stress. In the hypothalamus prior stress for 3 
      days strongly enhanced the homotypic stress-induced iNOS level and repeated
      stress for 7 and 14 days blunted this effect. Repeated stress increased IL-1beta 
      level in response to homotypic stress after 3 days and after 14 days. The present
      results indicate time-related similarities in the potent alterations in IL-1beta 
      and iNOS protein levels in brain structures. Single restraint induced a
      significant increase of plasma IL-1beta level which was abolished by pretreatment
      with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). A parallel strong increase of plasma ACTH
      and corticosterone levels were significantly impaired by IL-1Ra suggesting a
      marked involvement of stress-induced stimulation of ACTH and corticosterone by
      IL-1beta in single restraint. In repeatedly restrained rats IL-1Ra significantly 
      blunted plasma IL-1beta level induced by homotypic stress. A parallel strong
      increase in plasma ACTH level by homotypic stress was not substantially altered
      by pretreatment with IL-1Ra in repeatedly stressed rats. Plasma a corticosterone 
      level increased by homotypic stress in rats restrained for 3 and 14 days was not 
      affected by pretreatment with IL-1Ra, but after for 7 days its level was
      significantly enhanced. These results suggest that repeated stress desensitizes
      IL-1beta-induced stimulatory component in a single restraint stress-induced
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stimulation. A sensitization by
      homotypic stress of corticosterone response after restraint for 7 days may depend
      on other stimulatory systems acting within adrenal glands during prolonged
      stress. Comparative data from the same model of rather mild psychological stress 
      allows for the comparison of functional adaptive changes of NO synthases and
      IL-1beta in brain structures involved in stress regulation. In general, the iNOS 
      system is strongly sensitized by repeated stress for 3 days in prefrontal cortex 
      and hippocampus. Increased plasma IL-1beta level by a single restraint stress is 
      significantly involved in ACTH and corticosterone secretion. Repeated stress for 
      3-14 days reduces this participation of IL-1beta in pituitary-adrenal
      stimulation.

TI  - Modulation of Higher-Order Olfaction Components on Executive Functions in Humans.

AB  - The prefrontal (PFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) appear to be associated with 
      both executive functions and olfaction. However, there is little data relating
      olfactory processing and executive functions in humans. The present study aimed
      at exploring the role of olfaction on executive functioning, making a distinction
      between primary and more cognitive aspects of olfaction. Three executive tasks of
      similar difficulty were used. One was used to assess hot executive functions
      (Iowa Gambling Task-IGT), and two as a measure of cold executive functioning
      (Stroop Colour and Word Test-SCWT and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test-WCST). Sixty
      two healthy participants were included: 31 with normosmia and 31 with hyposmia.
      Olfactory abilities were assessed using the ''Sniffin' Sticks'' test and the
      olfactory threshold, odour discrimination and odour identification measures were 
      obtained. All participants were female, aged between 18 and 60. Results showed
      that participants with hyposmia displayed worse performance in decision making
      (IGT; Cohen's-d = 0.91) and cognitive flexibility (WCST; Cohen's-d between 0.54
      and 0.68) compared to those with normosmia. Multiple regression adjusted by the
      covariates participants' age and education level showed a positive association
      between odour identification and the cognitive inhibition response
      (SCWT-interference; Beta = 0.29; p = .034). The odour discrimination capacity was
      not a predictor of the cognitive executive performance. Our results suggest that 
      both hot and cold executive functions seem to be associated with higher-order
      olfactory functioning in humans. These results robustly support the hypothesis
      that olfaction and executive measures have a common neural substrate in PFC and
      OFC, and suggest that olfaction might be a reliable cognitive marker in
      psychiatric and neurologic disorders.

TI  - Maintaining Gait Performance by Cortical Activation during Dual-Task
      Interference: A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Study.
PG  - e0129390
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0129390 [doi]
AB  - In daily life, mobility requires walking while performing a cognitive or
      upper-extremity motor task. Although previous studies have evaluated the effects 
      of dual tasks on gait performance, few studies have evaluated cortical activation
      and its association with gait disturbance during dual tasks. In this study, we
      simultaneously assessed gait performance and cerebral oxygenation in the
      bilateral prefrontal cortices (PFC), premotor cortices (PMC), and supplemental
      motor areas (SMA), using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, in 17 young
      adults performing dual tasks. Each participant was evaluated while performing
      normal-pace walking (NW), walking while performing a cognitive task (WCT), and
      walking while performing a motor task (WMT). Our results indicated that the left 
      PFC exhibited the strongest and most sustained activation during WCT, and that NW
      and WMT were associated with minor increases in oxygenation levels during their
      initial phases. We observed increased activation in channels in the SMA and PMC
      during WCT and WMT. Gait data indicated that WCT and WMT both caused reductions
      in walking speed, but these reductions resulted from differing alterations in
      gait properties. WCT was associated with significant changes in cadence, stride
      time, and stride length, whereas WMT was associated with reductions in stride
      length only. During dual-task activities, increased activation of the PMC and SMA
      correlated with declines in gait performance, indicating a control mechanism for 
      maintaining gait performance during dual tasks. Thus, the regulatory effects of
      cortical activation on gait behavior enable a second task to be performed while
      walking.

      mouse brain: implications to glucocorticoid actions and major depression.
PG  - e578
LID - 10.1038/tp.2015.72 [doi]
AB  - Stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which in turn increases
      circulating glucocorticoid concentrations and stimulates the glucocorticoid
      receptor (GR). Chronically elevated glucocorticoids by repetitive exposure to
      stress are implicated in major depression and anxiety disorders. Cyclin-dependent
      kinase 5 (CDK5), a molecule essential for nervous system development, function
      and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, can modulate GR activity through
      phosphorylation. We examined potential contribution of CDK5 to stress response
      and pathophysiology of major depression. In mice, acute immobilized stress (AS)
      caused a biphasic effect on CDK5 activity, initially reducing but increasing
      afterwards in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIPPO), whereas chronic
      unpredictable stress (CS) strongly increased it in these brain areas, indicating 
      that AS and CS differentially regulate this kinase activity in a brain
      region-specific fashion. GR phosphorylation contemporaneously followed the
      observed changes of CDK5 activity after AS, thus CDK5 may in part alter GR
      phosphorylation upon this stress. In the postmortem brains of subjects with major
      depression, CDK5 activity was elevated in Brodmann's area 25, but not in entire
      PFC and HIPPO. Messenger RNA expression of
      glucocorticoid-regulated/stress-related genes showed distinct expression profiles
      in several brain areas of these stressed mice or depressive subjects in which
      CDK5-mediated changes in GR phosphorylation may have some regulatory roles. Taken
      together, these results indicate that CDK5 is an integral component of stress
      response and major depression with regulatory means specific to different
      stressors, brain areas and diseases in part through changing phosphorylation of
      GR.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.1414728112 [doi]
AB  - Ketamine produces rapid and sustained antidepressant actions in depressed
      patients, but the precise cellular mechanisms underlying these effects have not
      been identified. Here we determined if modulation of neuronal activity in the
      infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IL-PFC) underlies the antidepressant and
      anxiolytic actions of ketamine. We found that neuronal inactivation of the IL-PFC
      completely blocked the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of systemic ketamine
      in rodent models and that ketamine microinfusion into IL-PFC reproduced these
      behavioral actions of systemic ketamine. We also found that optogenetic
      stimulation of the IL-PFC produced rapid and long-lasting antidepressant and
      anxiolytic effects and that these effects are associated with increased number
      and function of spine synapses of layer V pyramidal neurons. The results
      demonstrate that ketamine infusions or optogenetic stimulation of IL-PFC are
      sufficient to produce long-lasting antidepressant behavioral and synaptic
      responses similar to the effects of systemic ketamine administration.

AB  - Being bullied during adolescence is associated with later mental illnesses
      characterized by deficits in cognitive tasks mediated by prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
      dopamine (DA). Social defeat of adolescent male rats, as a model of teenage
      bullying victimization, results in medial PFC (mPFC) dopamine (DA) hypofunction
      in adulthood that is associated with increased drug seeking and working memory
      deficits. Increased expression of the DA transporter (DAT) is also seen in the
      adult infralimbic mPFC following adolescent defeat. We propose the functional
      consequence of this increased DAT expression is enhanced DA clearance and
      subsequently decreased infralimbic mPFC DA availability. To test this, in vivo
      chronoamperometry was used to measure changes in accumulation of the DA signal
      following DAT blockade, with increased DAT-mediated clearance being reflected by 
      lower DA signal accumulation. Previously defeated rats and controls were
      pre-treated with the norepinephrine transporter (NET) inhibitor desipramine (20
      mg/kg, ip.) to isolate infralimbic mPFC DA clearance to DAT, then administered
      the selective DAT inhibitor GBR-12909 (20 or 40 mg/kg, sc.). Sole NET inhibition 
      with desipramine produced no differences in DA signal accumulation between
      defeated rats and controls. However, rats exposed to adolescent social defeat
      demonstrated decreased DA signal accumulation compared to controls in response to
      both doses of GBR-12909, indicating greater DAT-mediated clearance of infralimbic
      mPFC DA. These results suggest that protracted increases in infralimbic mPFC DAT 
      function represent a mechanism by which adolescent social defeat stress produces 
      deficits in adult mPFC DA activity and corresponding behavioral and cognitive
      dysfunction.

TI  - Decision-making of Prefrontal Patients with the Iowa Gambling Task: Unexpected
      Spared Performances and Preliminary Evidence for the Need of Alternative
      Measures.
PG  - 509-21
LID - 10.1080/13854046.2015.1050458 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Human decision-making is a growing area of research most commonly
      associated with the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), which was first developed to assess
      patients with prefrontal cortex (PFC) damage. The IGT is now considered an
      appropriate task to predict behavioral disorders in various clinical populations.
      However, several studies have questioned the validity and reliability of the
      task, arguing that its particular payoff scheme may influence the decision-making
      process in terms of sensitivity to gain-loss frequency (GLF) rather than
      long-term outcome (the basic assumption of IGT). Despite the potential
      significance of this assertion for the diagnosis of decision-making deficits, few
      studies have addressed the influence of GLF on IGT performances in clinical
      populations, and there is no study to date that involves patients with prefrontal
      lobe damage. METHOD: We tested 17 patients with PFC damage and 17 matched healthy
      controls with the IGT to analyze influence in choice behavior of both long-term
      outcomes and GLF. RESULTS: There was a difference between groups in the GLF
      score, but none between groups in the long-term outcome variable (the traditional
      measure). Our findings demonstrate that only control subjects seemed able to
      consider both long-term outcome and GLF. CONCLUSIONS: The discussion focuses on
      the contribution of empirical data, which may have implications for the clinical 
      assessment of decision-making ability with the IGT.

TI  - Risk-Taking Behavior in a Computerized Driving Task: Brain Activation Correlates 
      of Decision-Making, Outcome, and Peer Influence in Male Adolescents.
PG  - e0129516
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0129516 [doi]
AB  - Increased propensity for risky behavior in adolescents, particularly in peer
      groups, is thought to reflect maturational imbalance between reward processing
      and cognitive control systems that affect decision-making. We used functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain functional correlates of
      risk-taking behavior and effects of peer influence in 18-19-year-old male
      adolescents. The subjects were divided into low and high risk-taking groups using
      either personality tests or risk-taking rates in a simulated driving task. The
      fMRI data were analyzed for decision-making (whether to take a risk at
      intersections) and outcome (pass or crash) phases, and for the influence of peer 
      competition. Personality test-based groups showed no difference in the amount of 
      risk-taking (similarly increased during peer competition) and brain activation.
      When groups were defined by actual task performance, risk-taking activated two
      areas in the left medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) significantly more in low than
      in high risk-takers. In the entire sample, risky decision-specific activation was
      found in the anterior and dorsal cingulate, superior parietal cortex, basal
      ganglia (including the nucleus accumbens), midbrain, thalamus, and hypothalamus. 
      Peer competition increased outcome-related activation in the right caudate head
      and cerebellar vermis in the entire sample. Our results suggest that the
      activation of the medial (rather than lateral) PFC and striatum is most specific 
      to risk-taking behavior of male adolescents in a simulated driving situation, and
      reflect a stronger conflict and thus increased cognitive effort to take risks in 
      low risk-takers, and reward anticipation for risky decisions, respectively. The
      activation of the caudate nucleus, particularly for the positive outcome (pass)
      during peer competition, further suggests enhanced reward processing of
      risk-taking under peer influence.

      male and female rats.

AB  - Adolescence is a critical period of brain maturation characterized by the
      reorganization of interacting neural networks. In particular the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC), a region involved in executive function, undergoes synaptic and
      neuronal pruning during this time in both humans and rats. Our laboratory has
      previously shown that rats lose neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
      and there is an increase in white matter under the frontal cortex between
      adolescence and adulthood. Female rats lose more neurons during this period, and 
      ovarian hormones may play a role as ovariectomy before adolescence prevents
      neuronal loss. However, little is known regarding the timing of neuroanatomical
      changes that occur between early adolescence and adulthood. In the present study,
      we quantified the number of neurons and glia in the male and female mPFC at
      multiple time points from preadolescence through adulthood (postnatal days 25,
      35, 45, 60 and 90). Females, but not males, lost a significant number of neurons 
      in the mPFC between days 35 and 45, coinciding with the onset of puberty. Counts 
      of GABA immunoreactive cell bodies indicated that the neurons lost were not
      primarily GABAergic. These results suggest that in females, pubertal hormones may
      exert temporally specific changes in PFC anatomy. As expected, both males and
      females gained white matter under the PFC throughout adolescence, though these
      gains in females were diminished after day 35, but not in males. The differences 
      in cell loss in males and females may lead to differential vulnerability to
      external influences and dysfunctions of the PFC that manifest in adolescence.

PG  - 158-64
LID - 10.1192/bjp.bp.114.152223 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with cocaine and gambling addictions exhibit cognitive
      flexibility deficits that may underlie persistence of harmful behaviours. AIMS:
      We investigated the neural substrates of cognitive inflexibility in cocaine users
      v. pathological gamblers, aiming to disambiguate common mechanisms v. cocaine
      effects. METHOD: Eighteen cocaine users, 18 pathological gamblers and 18 controls
      performed a probabilistic reversal learning task during functional magnetic
      resonance imaging, and were genotyped for the DRD2/ANKK Taq1A polymorphism.
      RESULTS: Cocaine users and pathological gamblers exhibited reduced ventrolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) signal during reversal shifting. Cocaine users further
      showed increased dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) activation relative to pathological
      gamblers during perseveration, and decreased dorsolateral PFC activation relative
      to pathological gamblers and controls during shifting. Preliminary genetic
      findings indicated that cocaine users carrying the DRD2/ANKK Taq1A1+ genotype may
      derive unique stimulatory effects on shifting-related ventrolateral PFC signal.
      CONCLUSIONS: Reduced ventrolateral PFC activation during shifting may constitute 
      a common neural marker across gambling and cocaine addictions. Additional
      cocaine-related effects relate to a wider pattern of task-related dysregulation, 
      reflected in signal abnormalities in dorsolateral and dmPFC.

AB  - Among vertebrates hippocampus forms the major component of the brain in
      consolidating information from short-term memory to long-term memory. Aging is
      considered as the major risk factor for memory impairment in sporadic Alzheimer's
      disease (SAD) like pathology. Present study thus aims at investigating whether
      age-specific degeneration of neuronal-circuits in hippocampal formation
      (neural-layout of Subiculum-hippocampus proper-dentate gyrus (DG)-entorhinal
      cortex (EC)) results in cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the neuroprotective
      effect of Resveratrol (RSV) was attempted to study in the formation of
      hippocampal neuronal-circuits. Radial-Arm-Maze was conducted to evaluate
      hippocampal-dependent spatial and learning memory in control and experimental
      rats. Nissl staining of frontal cortex (FC), subiculum, hippocampal-proper
      (CA1-->CA2-->CA3-->CA4), DG, amygdala, cerebellum, thalamus, hypothalamus, layers
      of temporal and parietal lobe of the neocortex were examined for pathological
      changes in young and aged wistar rats, with and without RSV. Hippocampal
      trisynaptic circuit (EC layerII-->DG-->CA3-->CA1) forming new memory and
      monosynaptic circuit (EC-->CA1) that strengthen old memories were found disturbed
      in aged rats. Loss of Granular neuron observed in DG and polymorphic cells of CA4
      can lead to decreased mossy fibers disturbing neural-transmission (CA4-->CA3) in 
      perforant pathway. Further, intensity of nissl granules (stratum lacunosum
      moleculare (SLM)-SR-SO) of CA3 pyramidal neurons was decreased, disturbing the
      communication in schaffer collaterals (CA3-CA1) during aging. We also noticed
      disarranged neuronal cell layer in Subiculum (presubiculum (PrS)-parasubiculum
      (PaS)), interfering output from hippocampus to prefrontal cortex (PFC), EC,
      hypothalamus, and amygdala that may result in interruption of thought processes. 
      We conclude from our observations that poor memory performance of aged rats as
      evidenced through radial arm maze (RAM) analysis was due to the defect in
      neuronal-circuits of hippocampus (DG-CA4-CA1-Sub) that were significantly damaged
      leading to memory impairment. Interestingly, RSV was observed to culminate
      pathological events in the hippocampal neuronal circuit during aging, proving
      them as potent therapeutic drug against age-associated neurodegeneration and
      memory loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cortical GABA regulates a number of cognitive functions including
      attention and working memory and is dysregulated in a number of psychiatric
      conditions. In schizophrenia for example, changes in GABA neurons [reduced
      expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), parvalbumin (PV) and the GABA
      reuptake transporter (GAT1)] suggest reduced cortical GABA synthesis and release;
      these changes are hypothesized to cause the cognitive deficits observed in this
      disorder. The goals of this experiment were to determine whether chronically
      reducing GAD function within the rat PFC causes attention deficits and
      alterations in PV and GAT1 expression. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were
      trained on the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT, a task of attention)
      until they reached criterion performance and then were implanted with a bilateral
      cannula aimed at the medial PFC. Cannulae were connected to osmotic minipumps
      that infused the GAD inhibitor l-allylglycine (LAG, 3.2mug/0.5mul/h) for 13days. 
      Following a 5-day recovery from surgery rats were tested on the standard 5CSRTT
      for 5 consecutive days and then tested on two modifications of the 5CSRTT.
      Finally, locomotor activity was assessed and the rats sacrificed. Brains were
      rapidly extracted and flash frozen and analyzed for the expression of GAD67, PV, 
      GAT1 and the obligatory NMDA receptor subunit NR1. RESULTS: Chronic LAG infusions
      transiently impaired attention, persistently impaired impulse control and
      increased locomotor activity. Behavioral changes were associated with an
      upregulation of GAD67, but no change in PV, GAT1 or NR1 expression. SUMMARY:
      Chronic inhibition of GABA synthesis within the medial PFC, increased impulsive
      behavior and locomotion, but did not impair attention; results consistent with
      previous research following acute inhibition of GABA synthesis. Moreover, our
      data do not support the hypothesis that decreasing GABA synthesis and release is 
      sufficient to cause changes in other GABA-related proteins.

AB  - Individual variability in delay of gratification (DG) is associated with a number
      of important outcomes in both non-human and human primates. Using diffusion
      tensor imaging (DTI), this study describes the relationship between probabilistic
      estimates of white matter tracts projecting from the caudate to the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) and DG abilities in a sample of 49 captive chimpanzees (Pan
      troglodytes). After accounting for time between collection of DTI scans and DG
      measurement, age and sex, higher white matter connectivity between the caudate
      and right dorsal PFC was found to be significantly associated with the
      acquisition (i.e. training phase) but not the maintenance of DG abilities. No
      other associations were found to be significant. The integrity of white matter
      connectivity between regions of the striatum and the PFC appear to be associated 
      with inhibitory control in chimpanzees, with perturbations on this circuit
      potentially leading to a variety of maladaptive outcomes. Additionally, results
      have potential translational implications for understanding the pathophysiology
      of a number of psychiatric and clinical outcomes in humans.

AB  - Adolescent anxiety is common and impairing and often persists into adulthood.
      There is growing evidence that adult anxiety is characterized by abnormal fear
      responses to threat and safety cues, along with perturbations in fear-related
      neural circuits. Although some of this work has been extended to adolescents,
      with promising results, it is not yet clear whether changes in these circuits
      across developmental age varies between anxious and non-anxious adolescents. Here
      we used fMRI to examine how age modulates neural responses as adolescents are
      exposed to threat and safety cues. Participants were 15 anxious and 11
      non-anxious adolescents (age 12-17) who completed a fear conditioning paradigm.
      The paradigm incorporated a threat cue comprising a neutral face which was paired
      with a fearful, screaming face, a safety cue comprising a different neutral face,
      and a control stimulus. Across the whole sample, neural activation to the threat 
      cue (relative to the control cue) correlated positively with age in a number of
      regions, including the dorsal anterior cingulate and bilateral dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, neural activation to the safety cue (relative
      to the control cue) was modulated differently by age in the two groups: a more
      positive association between activation and age was observed in the control group
      compared to the anxious group in various regions including medial and
      dorsolateral PFC, anterior insula, and amygdala. These findings suggest that
      maturation of the neural substrates of fear responses to safety cues may be
      perturbed in anxious adolescents, potentially contributing to the emergence and
      maintenance of anxiety disorders in adulthood.

AB  - Rodent studies show how prenatal stress (PS) can alter morphology in the
      cortico-limbic structures that support emotional and cognitive functions.
      PS-induced alteration is less well described in species with a gyrencephalic
      brain and complex earlier fetal development, and never in sheep at birth to rule 
      out postnatal environment effects or influences of maternal behavior. This study 
      aimed to assess the consequences of a mild chronic stress in pregnant ewes on the
      neurobiological development of their lambs at birth. During the last third of
      gestation, 7 ewes were exposed daily to various unpredictable and negative
      routine management-based challenges (stressed group), while 7 other ewes were
      housed without any additional perturbation (control group). For each group, a
      newborn from each litter was sacrificed at birth to collect its brain and analyze
      its expression levels of genes involved in neuronal dendritic morphology (Dlg4,
      Rac1, RhoA, Doc2b), synaptic transmission (Nr1, Grin2A, Grin2B) and
      glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3C1) in hippocampus (HPC), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
      amygdala (AMYG). Results revealed that lambs from stressed dam (PS lambs) showed 
      under-expression of Rac1 and Nr1 in PFC and overexpression of Dlg4 in AMYG
      compared to controls. To assess the morphological consequences of gene
      dysregulations, the dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons was explored by
      Golgi-Cox staining in HPC and PFC. PS lambs had higher dendritic spine density in
      both structures and more stubby-type spines in the CA1 area of HPC than controls.
      This is the first demonstration in sheep that PS alters fetal brain, possibly
      reflecting functional changes in synaptic transmission to cope with adversity
      experienced in fetal life.

TI  - A Programmer-Interpreter Neural Network Architecture for Prefrontal Cognitive
      Control.
PG  - 1550017
LID - 10.1142/S0129065715500173 [doi]
AB  - There is wide consensus that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is able to exert
      cognitive control on behavior by biasing processing toward task-relevant
      information and by modulating response selection. This idea is typically framed
      in terms of top-down influences within a cortical control hierarchy, where
      prefrontal-basal ganglia loops gate multiple input-output channels, which in turn
      can activate or sequence motor primitives expressed in (pre-)motor cortices. Here
      we advance a new hypothesis, based on the notion of programmability and an
      interpreter-programmer computational scheme, on how the PFC can flexibly bias the
      selection of sensorimotor patterns depending on internal goal and task contexts. 
      In this approach, multiple elementary behaviors representing motor primitives are
      expressed by a single multi-purpose neural network, which is seen as a reusable
      area of "recycled" neurons (interpreter). The PFC thus acts as a "programmer"
      that, without modifying the network connectivity, feeds the interpreter networks 
      with specific input parameters encoding the programs (corresponding to network
      structures) to be interpreted by the (pre-)motor areas. Our architecture is
      validated in a standard test for executive function: the 1-2-AX task. Our results
      show that this computational framework provides a robust, scalable and flexible
      scheme that can be iterated at different hierarchical layers, supporting the
      realization of multiple goals. We discuss the plausibility of the
      "programmer-interpreter" scheme to explain the functioning of
      prefrontal-(pre)motor cortical hierarchies.

AB  - Increasing plasticity in neurons of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been proposed
      as a possible therapeutic tool to enhance extinction, a process that is impaired 
      in post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and addiction. To test this
      hypothesis, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress neurogranin (a
      calmodulin-binding protein that facilitates long-term potentiation) in the PFC.
      Neurogranin overexpression in the PFC enhanced long-term potentiation and
      increased the rates of extinction learning of both fear conditioning and sucrose 
      self-administration. Our results indicate that elevated neurogranin function
      within the PFC can enhance local plasticity and increase the rate of extinction
      learning across different behavioral tasks. Thus, neurogranin can provide a
      molecular link between enhanced plasticity and enhanced extinction.

AB  - The current study aimed to test a dual-systems model of adolescent brain
      development by studying changes in intrinsic functional connectivity within and
      across networks typically associated with cognitive-control and
      affective-motivational processes. To this end, resting-state and task-related
      fMRI data were collected of 269 participants (ages 8-25). Resting-state analyses 
      focused on seeds derived from task-related neural activation in the same
      participants: the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) from a cognitive
      rule-learning paradigm and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) from a reward-paradigm.
      Whole-brain seed-based resting-state analyses showed an age-related increase in
      dlPFC connectivity with the caudate and thalamus, and an age-related decrease in 
      connectivity with the (pre)motor cortex. nAcc connectivity showed a strengthening
      of connectivity with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and subcortical
      structures such as the hippocampus, and a specific age-related decrease in
      connectivity with the ventral medial PFC (vmPFC). Behavioral measures from both
      functional paradigms correlated with resting-state connectivity strength with
      their respective seed. That is, age-related change in learning performance was
      mediated by connectivity between the dlPFC and thalamus, and age-related change
      in winning pleasure was mediated by connectivity between the nAcc and vmPFC.
      These patterns indicate (i) strengthening of connectivity between regions that
      support control and learning, (ii) more independent functioning of regions that
      support motor and control networks, and (iii) more independent functioning of
      regions that support motivation and valuation networks with age. These results
      are interpreted vis-a-vis a dual-systems model of adolescent brain development.

TI  - Ibudilast reverses the decrease in the synaptic signaling protein
      phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1) produced by chronic
      methamphetamine intake in rats.
PG  - 15-23
LID - 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.04.012 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic methamphetamine intake has been shown to induce a
      neuroinflammatory state leading to significant changes in brain functioning
      including behavioral changes. These changes can persist for years after drug use 
      is discontinued and likely contribute to the risk of relapse. A better
      understanding of inflammation responses associated with methamphetamine intake
      may help in designing novel and more efficacious treatment strategies. METHODS:
      Rats were trained to self-administer methamphetamine or saline on a variable
      ratio 3 schedule of reinforcement (25 days). This training was followed by 12
      days of extinction (i.e., methamphetamine unavailable) during which rats received
      daily post-session administration of ibudilast (AV411; 2.5 or 7.5mg/kg) or
      saline. Following extinction, synaptosomes were isolated from the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) and the differential pattern of synaptic proteins was assessed using
      mass spectrometry based proteomics. RESULTS: Treatment with ibudilast allowed for
      deeper extinction of active lever pressing. Quantitative mass spectrometry based 
      proteomics on the PFC identified one potential hit; the synaptic signaling
      protein phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1). While methamphetamine
      intake was associated with reduced PEBP1 protein levels, treatment with ibudilast
      reversed this effect. Furthermore, decreased PEBP1 expression was correlated with
      subsequent activation of Raf-1, MEK, and ERK signaling components of the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (MAPK). Raf-1, MEK, and ERK expression
      levels were also attenuated by ibudilast treatment. CONCLUSION: PEBP1, given its 
      synaptic localization and its role as a signaling molecule acting via the
      ERK/MAPK pathway, could be a potential therapeutic target mediating drug-seeking 
      behaviors associated with neuroinflammation.

      alpha1-AR agonist phenylephrine (Phe) on GABAergic transmission onto pyramidal
      neurons in the deep layers of the mPFC. We found that bath application of Phe
      dose-dependently increased the amplitude of evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs). Phe increased 
      the frequency but not the amplitude of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs). Ca(2+) influx
      through T-type voltage-gated calcium channels is required for Phe-induced
      increases in GABA release. Phe increases GABA release probability and the number 
      of releasable vesicles. Phe depolarizes the fast-spiking (FS) interneurons
      without effects on the firing rate of action potentials (APs) of interneurons.
      Phe-induced depolarization is independent of extracellular Na(+), Ca(2+) and
      T-type calcium channels, but requires inward rectifier K(+) channels (Kirs). The 
      present study demonstrates that Phe enhances GABAergic transmission onto mPFC
      pyramidal neurons through inhibiting interneurons Kirs, which further depolarizes
      interneurons leading to increase in Ca(2+) influx via T-type calcium channels.
      Our results may provide a cellular and molecular mechanism that helps explain
      alpha1-AR-induced PFC dysfunction.

AB  - While schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have been assumed to share phenotypic
      and genotypic features, there is also evidence for overlapping brain structural
      correlates, although it is unclear whether these relate to shared psychotic
      features. In this study, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM8) in 34
      schizophrenia patients, 17 euthymic bipolar I disorder patients (with a history
      of psychotic symptoms), and 34 healthy controls. Our results indicate that
      compared to healthy controls schizophrenia patients show grey matter deficits
      (p<0.05, FDR corrected) in medial and right dorsolateral prefrontal, as well as
      bilaterally in ventrolateral prefrontal and insular cortical areas, thalamus
      (bilaterally), left superior temporal cortex, and minor medial parietal and
      parietooccipital areas. Comparing schizophrenia vs. bipolar I patients (p<0.05,
      FDR corrected) yielded a similar pattern, however, there was an additional
      significant reduction in schizophrenia patients in the (posterior) hippocampus
      bilaterally, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left cerebellum. Compared
      to healthy controls, the deficits in bipolar I patients only reached significance
      at p<0.001 (uncorr.) for a minor parietal cluster, but not for prefrontal areas. 
      Our results suggest that the more extensive prefrontal, thalamic, and hippocampal
      deficits that might set apart schizophrenia and bipolar disorder might not be
      related to mere appearance of psychotic symptoms at some stage of the disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Expression of the neuronal membrane glycoprotein M6a (GPM6A), the
      proteolipid protein (PLP/DM20) family member, is downregulated in the hippocampus
      of chronically stressed animals. Its neuroplastic function involves a role in
      neurite formation, filopodium outgrowth and synaptogenesis through an unknown
      mechanism. Disruptions in neuroplasticity mechanisms have been shown to play a
      significant part in the etiology of depression. Thus, the current investigation
      examined whether GPM6A expression is also altered in human depressed brain.
      METHODS: Expression levels and coexpression patterns of GPM6A, GPM6B, and PLP1
      (two other members of PLP/DM20 family) as well as of the neuroplasticity-related 
      genes identified to associate with GPM6A were determined using quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in postmortem samples from the hippocampus (n = 
      18) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (n = 25) of depressed suicide victims and
      compared with control subjects (hippocampus n = 18; PFC n = 25).
      Neuroplasticity-related proteins that form complexes with GPM6A were identified
      by coimmunoprecipitation technique followed by mass spectrometry. RESULTS:
      Results indicated transcriptional downregulation of GPM6A and GPM6B in the
      hippocampus of depressed suicides. The expression level of
      calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CAMK2A) and coronin1A
      (CORO1A) was also significantly decreased. Subsequent analysis of coexpression
      patterns demonstrated coordinated gene expression in the hippocampus and in the
      PFC indicating that the function of these genes might be coregulated in the human
      brain. However, in the brain of depressed suicides this coordinated response was 
      disrupted. CONCLUSIONS: Disruption of coordinated gene expression as well as
      abnormalities in GPM6A and GPM6B expression and expression of the components of
      GPM6A complexes were detected in the brain of depressed suicides.

AB  - In this study, the effect of Chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone), an important member 
      of the flavonoid family, on memory impairment, oxidative stress and BDNF
      reduction generated by aging in mice were investigated. Young and aged mice were 
      treated daily per 60days with Chrysin (1 and 10mg/kg; per oral, p.o.) or veichle 
      (10ml/kg; p.o.). Mice were trained and tested in Morris Water Maze task. After
      the behavioural test, the levels of reactive species (RS), the activity of
      superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as
      well as the activity of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase and the levels of brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were determined in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
      hippocampus (HC) of mice. Results demonstrated that the age-related memory
      decline was partially protected by Chrysin at a dose of 1mg/kg, and normalized at
      the dose of 10mg/kg (p<0.001). Treatment with Chrysin significantly attenuated
      the increase of RS levels and the inhibition of SOD, CAT and GPx activities of
      aged mice. Inhibition of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity in PFC and HP of aged mice
      was also attenuated by Chrysin treatment. Moreover, Chrysin marked mitigated the 
      decrease of BDNF levels in the PFC and HC of aged mice. These results
      demonstrated that flavonoid Chrysin, an antioxidant compound, was able to prevent
      age-associated memory probably by their free radical scavenger action and
      modulation of BDNF production. Thus, this study indicates that Chrysin may
      represent a new pharmacological approach to alleviate the age-related declines
      during normal age, acting as an anti-aging agent.

AB  - Distinct isoforms of the PI3K catalytic subunit have specialized functions in the
      brain, but their role in cognition is unknown. Here, we show that the catalytic
      subunit p110beta plays an important role in prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent
      cognitive defects in mouse models of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), an inherited
      intellectual disability. FXS is caused by loss of function of the fragile X
      mental retardation protein (FMRP), which binds and translationally represses
      mRNAs. PFC-selective knockdown of p110beta, an FMRP target that is
      translationally upregulated in FXS, reverses deficits in higher cognition in Fmr1
      knockout mice. Genetic full-body reduction of p110beta in Fmr1 knockout mice
      normalizes excessive PI3K activity, restores stimulus-induced protein synthesis, 
      and corrects increased dendritic spine density and behavior. Notably, adult-onset
      PFC-selective Fmr1 knockdown mice show impaired cognition, which is rescued by
      simultaneous p110beta knockdown. Our results suggest that FMRP-mediated control
      of p110beta is crucial for neuronal protein synthesis and cognition.

      prefrontal (PFC) and parietal volumes and executive function in emerging adult MJ
      users and explored potential gender differences. METHODS: Participants (ages
      18-25) were 27 MJ users and 32 controls without neurologic or psychiatric
      disorders or heavy other drug use. A series of multiple regressions examined
      whether group status, past year MJ use, and their interactions with gender
      predicted ROI volumes. Post hoc analyses consisted of brain-behavior correlations
      between volumes and cognitive variables and Fisher's z tests to assess group
      differences. RESULTS: MJ users demonstrated significantly smaller medial
      orbitofrontal (mOFC; p = 0.004, FDR p = 0.024) and inferior parietal volumes (p =
      0.04, FDR p = 0.12); follow-up regressions found that increased past year MJ use 
      did not significantly dose-dependently predict smaller mOFC volume in a
      sub-sample of individuals with at least one past year MJ use. There were no
      significant gender interactions. There was a significant brain-behavior
      difference by group, such that smaller mOFC volumes were associated with poorer
      complex attention for MJ users (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Smaller mOFC volumes
      among MJ users suggest disruption of typical neurodevelopmental processes
      associated with regular MJ use for both genders. These results highlight the need
      for longitudinal, multi-modal imaging studies providing clearer information on
      timing of neurodevelopmental processes and neurocognitive impacts of youth MJ
      initiation.

AB  - Maternal deprivation (MD) appears to be one of the environmental factors involved
      in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. A widely used animal model of the
      schizophrenia involves the administration of ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic,
      NMDA receptors noncompetitive antagonist, that induce symptoms such as
      schizophrenia. To clarify the molecular mechanism of schizophrenia induced by MD,
      we investigated alterations in energetic metabolism, oxidative stress and
      neurotrophic factor levels in the brain of rats following MD and/or a single
      administration of ketamine during adulthood. Male Wistar rats were subjected to
      MD for 10 days. Additionally, these animals received acute ketamine (5, 15 or 25 
      mg/kg by intraperitoneal route, i.p.) during adulthood, and 30 min later, they
      were killed and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the hippocampus and the striatum
      were removed for molecular analyses. Ketamine 25 mg/kg and/or MD and Ketamine 15 
      and 5 mg/kg with MD decreased the creatine kinase (CK) activity in the
      hippocampus. The enzyme activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in the Krebs
      cycle had increased in the striatum following the administration of ketamine 25
      mg/kg, MD per se or MD plus ketamine 5 and 15 mg/kg. MD per se or MD combined
      with ketamine in different doses increased the activity of mitochondrial
      complexes. The PFC of animals subjected to MD and administered with ketamine 5
      mg/kg exhibited increased protein carbonyl content. In the hippocampus, ketamine 
      15 mg/kg, ketamine 25 mg/kg and MD each increased the carbonyl content. In the
      striatum, the TBARS levels were increased by the administration of ketamine 25
      mg/kg. Finally, in the hippocampus, MD alone or in combination with ketamine
      reduced the Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) levels; however, the Brain-derived
      Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels were unaltered. In the present study, we
      suggest that MD increased the risk of psychotic symptoms in adulthood, altering
      different parameters of energy and oxidative stress. Our results suggest that
      adverse experiences occurring early in life may sensitize specific neurocircuits 
      to subsequent stressors, inducing vulnerability, and may help us understand the
      pathophysiological mechanisms involved in this disorder.

      response provoked by strong desire to void.

AB  - AIMS: In order to observe central responses during naturally occurring urinary
      bladder storage in healthy subjects, we examined brain areas that control strong 
      bladder sensation by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (rs-fMRI). METHODS: All subjects were right-handed and scanned twice under the
      following two conditions: empty bladder and full bladder ('strong desire to
      void') without the use of filling with a catheter. Brain imaging software (DPARSF
      and REST) was adopted to analyze the difference in brain-blood perfusion between 
      the two conditions. Voxel-based analysis of the regional homogeneity (Reho) maps 
      between empty and full bladder was performed with a paired t test. Statistical
      maps were set at P value <0.05 and were corrected for multiple comparisons.
      RESULTS: The rs-fMRI scans of 30 healthy subjects (8 men and 22 women, between 24
      and 49 years of age) were analyzed. The responses became stronger in the state of
      strong desire to void (P < 0.05). Increased activity during strong desire to void
      was observed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
      hypothalamus, temporal lobes and left caudate nucleus, which are involved in
      bladder perception related to large volumes in adults. CONCLUSIONS: There are
      significant changes in the brain's Reho during the strong sensation to void. The 
      results suggest that the PFC, the ACC, hypothalamus, temporal lobes and left
      caudate nucleus play a role in the cerebral control of bladder storage without
      artificial bladder filling in healthy people.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a crucial role in cognitive and affective
      functions. It contains a rich serotonergic (serotonin, 5-HT) innervation and a
      high density of 5-HT receptors. Endogenous 5-HT exerts robust actions on the
      activity of pyramidal neurons in medial PFC (mPFC) via excitatory 5-HT2A and
      inhibitory 5-HT1A receptors, suggesting the involvement of 5-HT neurotransmission
      in cortical functions. However, the underlying mechanisms must be elucidated.
      Here we examine the role of 5-HT2A receptors in the processing of emotional and
      cognitive signals evoked by increasing the 5-HT tone after acute blockade of the 
      5-HT transporter. Fluoxetine (5-20mg/kg i.p.) dose-dependently reduced the
      immobility time in the tail-suspension test in wild-type (WT) and 5-HT2Aknockout 
      (KO2A) mice, with non-significant differences between genotypes. Fluoxetine
      (10mg/kg i.p.) significantly impaired mice performance in the novel object
      recognition test 24h post-administration in WT, but not in KO2A mice. The
      comparable effect of fluoxetine on extracellular 5-HT in the mPFC of both
      genotypes suggests that presynaptic differences are not accountable. In contrast,
      single unit recordings of mPFC putative pyramidal neurons showed that fluoxetine 
      (1.8-7.2mg/kg i.v.) significantly increased neuronal discharge in KO2A but not in
      WT mice. This effect is possibly mediated by an altered excitatory/inhibitory
      balance in the PFC in KO2A mice. Overall, the present results suggest that 5-HT2A
      receptors play a detrimental role in long-term memory deficits mediated by an
      excess 5-HT in PFC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the known relationship between prefrontal function and
      increased suicidality during major depressive episodes, the links between
      prefrontal function and suicidality remain unclear in major depressive disorder
      (MDD). Suicidal ideation usually precedes a suicide attempt. If prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) activity is a biomarker for suicidal ideation in depression, monitoring it 
      could be useful for suicide prevention. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the
      association between prefrontal function and suicidal ideation in MDD. METHODS:
      Prefrontal function in 67 patients with MDD (31 with suicidal ideation and 36
      without) and 67 age-, gender-, and intelligence quotient-matched healthy controls
      (HCs) was evaluated using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during a verbal
      fluency task (VFT). Suicidal ideation was assessed using item 3 of the Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). RESULTS: Regional hemodynamic changes were
      significantly smaller in patients with MDD than in HCs in prefrontal and temporal
      regions. Hemodynamic changes in the right dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), orbitofrontal
      cortex (OFC), and right frontopolar cortex (FPC) regions in patients with MDD
      with suicidal ideation were significantly smaller than in those without suicidal 
      ideation. In addition, hemodynamic changes correlated negatively with the
      severity of suicidal ideation in the DLPFC, OFC, and FPC in patients with MDD.
      LIMITATIONS: Further studies with a larger sample size are required to verify our
      findings. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the DLPFC, OFC, and FPC are
      brain substrates of suicidal ideation in depressive states in patients with MDD, 
      and that NIRS data can be employed as a clinically useful biomarker for the
      assessment of suicide risk.

AB  - Estrogen deficiency is involved in the development of depression. However, the
      mechanism underlying estrogen modulates depression-like behavior remains largely 
      unknown. Inflammation and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) have been shown to
      play pivotal roles in various depression models. The objective of the present
      study was to investigate whether estrogen deficiency-induced depression-like
      behavior is associated with inflammation and IDO activation in brain. The results
      showed that ovariectomy resulted in depression-like behavior in female rats and
      caused a decrease in 5-HT content and an increase in levels of IDO, IFN-gamma,
      IL-6, toll like receptor (TLR)-4 and phosphorylated NF-kappaB (p65 subunit) in
      hippocampus but not in prefrontal cortex (PFC). 17beta-Estradiol (E2) treatment
      ameliorated depression-like behavior and restored above neurochemical
      alternations in hippocampus in ovariectomized rats. Partial correlation analysis 
      showed that the levels of phosphorylated p65, IFN-gamma and IL-6 in hippocampus
      correlated to serum E2 level. Our study suggests that estrogen inhibits
      inflammation and activates of IDO and maintains 5-HT level in hippocampus,
      thereby ameliorating depression-like behavior.

      altruistic behavior: An fNIRS study.

AB  - Previous studies suggest that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) is
      involved in modulating empathy. However, it is unclear whether VLPFC activation
      while an individual empathizes with others is related to subsequent altruistic
      behavior. In the present study, participants observed two people playing a card
      game while empathizing with one of them (target person); PFC activation during
      the task was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). After 
      this task, participants distributed money to the target person. Results showed
      that activation in the left VLPFC during empathizing with the target person, who 
      lost a small amount of money, was positively correlated with the amount of money 
      distributed; this activation mediated a relationship between norm of restitution 
      toward helping and the amount of distributed money. These results suggest that
      activation in the left VLPFC during empathizing with others experiencing negative
      circumstances is associated with altruistic behavior.

AB  - We investigate changes in gene expression of GluN1 subunit of
      N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus 
      and striatum in a rat model of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). We used male Wistar
      rats in which HE was induced after a common bile duct ligation (BDL). The animals
      were divided into three sets, and each set included three groups of control, sham
      operated and BDL. In the first set of animals, blood samples collected for
      biochemical analysis on day 21 of BDL. In the second set, changes in nociception 
      threshold was assessed on day 21 of BDL using a hotplate test. In the third set, 
      whole brain extracted, and the PFC, the hippocampus and the striatum in each rat 
      were immediately dissected. We used a semi-quantitative RT-PCR method for
      evaluating the GluN1 gene expression. The biochemical analyses showed that plasma
      levels of ammonia and bilirubin in BDL rats were significantly increased compared
      to the sham control group on day 21 of BDL (P < 0.01). Nociception threshold was 
      also increased in rats with BDL compared to sham group (P < 0.001). The results
      revealed that the GluN1 gene expression at mRNA levels in BDL group was decreased
      by 19 % in the PFC (P < 0.05) but increased by 82 % in the hippocampus (P < 0.01)
      compared to the sham control group; however, no significant change was observed
      in the striatum. It can be concluded that HE affects the GluN1 gene expression in
      rat brain with a site-specific pattern, and the PFC and hippocampus are more
      sensitive areas than striatum.

AB  - Morphine excites dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), an
      effect mediated by both local and systemic mechanisms. While the importance of
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) - VTA circuit in opiate addiction is well
      established, little is known about how the PFC regulates the activity of VTA DA
      neurons upon morphine stimulation. One major challenge is that VTA DA neurons are
      highly heterogeneous in terms of projection and regulation, making their
      responses to PFC manipulations variable. Our previous work has identified a
      subgroup of VTA DA neurons exhibiting significant slow oscillation in their
      firing sequence, and demonstrated that most of these neurons are functionally
      connected with the PFC. In the present study, we focus our efforts only on VTA DA
      neurons expressing strong slow oscillation, and report that blocking the neuronal
      activity in the PFC remarkably attenuates the morphine-induced excitation of
      these neurons. Using in vivo microdialysis, we find that inactivation of the PFC 
      also reduces the morphine-induced elevation of DA levels in the nucleus accumbens
      (NAc). Furthermore, 24 h after only single morphine exposure, PFC-inactivation
      failed to prevent subsequent morphine challenge from exciting VTA DA neurons,
      which is paralleled by altered response of PFC pyramidal neurons to morphine
      stimulation. Our results indicate that the PFC gates acute morphine action on a
      subset of VTA DA neurons, which is highly plastic and can be functionally
      remodeled by morphine exposure.

AB  - Maladaptive use of the Internet results in Internet addiction (IA), which is
      associated with various negative consequences. Molecular and functional imaging
      techniques have been increasingly used for analysis of neurobiological changes
      and neurochemical correlates of IA. This review summarizes molecular and
      functional imaging findings on neurobiological mechanisms of IA, focusing on
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear imaging modalities including
      positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT). MRI studies demonstrate that structural changes in frontal cortex are
      associated with functional abnormalities in Internet addicted subjects. Nuclear
      imaging findings indicate that IA is associated with dysfunction of the brain
      dopaminergic systems. Abnormal dopamine regulation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      could underlie the enhanced motivational value and uncontrolled behavior over
      Internet overuse in addicted subjects. Further investigations are needed to
      determine specific changes in the Internet addictive brain, as well as their
      implications for behavior and cognition.

TI  - Expression of CYP2E1 and CYP2U1 proteins in amygdala and prefrontal cortex:
      influence of alcoholism and smoking.
PG  - 790-7
LID - 10.1111/acer.12697 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The tissue-specific expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP, P450)
      in the human brain may influence the therapeutic response to, and side effects
      of, neuroactive drugs including alcohol. However, the distribution of many P450s,
      especially poorly characterized CYP2 forms, within specific regions of the brain 
      remains obscure, partly due to the paucity of available tissue and difficulty in 
      discriminating between related P450s with available antibodies. METHODS: In this 
      study, we analyzed the expression of CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2J2,
      CYP2S1, CYP2U1, and CYP2W1 proteins in human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala
      (AMG) by immunoblotting with antibodies for which the P450 form specificity had
      been enhanced by affinity purification. These brain regions were selected as they
      mediate the addictive effects of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption,
      substances known to modulate P450 expression in other tissues. PFC and AMG
      samples from alcoholic smokers, alcoholic nonsmokers, nonalcoholic smokers, and
      nonalcoholic nonsmokers were studied to assess the effect of alcohol use and
      smoking on the expression of these proteins. RESULTS: Of the P450s studied,
      CYP2E1 and CYP2U1 were expressed in all samples analyzed (n = 26 and 22 for
      CYP2E1 and CYP2U1, respectively), and elevated in alcoholics. CYP2U1 expression
      was also slightly increased in smokers. Expression of both P450s was increased in
      AMG compared to PFC of the same individuals. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first
      report of CYP2E1 and CYP2U1 protein expression in human AMG. Our results suggest 
      that CYP2U1 expression may be modulated by alcohol and tobacco, with potential
      consequent effects on the metabolism of drugs and endogenous chemicals by this
      enzyme.

TI  - Endogenous Opioid Signaling in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex is Required for the
      Expression of Hunger-Induced Impulsive Action.
PG  - 2464-74
LID - 10.1038/npp.2015.97 [doi]
AB  - Opioid transmission and dysregulated prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity have both
      been implicated in the inhibitory-control deficits associated with addiction and 
      binge-type eating disorders. What remains unknown, however, is whether endogenous
      opioid transmission within the PFC modulates inhibitory control. Here, we
      compared intra-PFC opioid manipulations with a monoamine manipulation
      (d-amphetamine), in two sucrose-reinforced tasks: progressive ratio (PR), which
      assays the motivational value of an incentive, and differential reinforcement of 
      low response rates (DRLs), a test of inhibitory control. Intra-PFC
      methylnaloxonium (M-NX, a limited diffusion opioid antagonist) was given to rats 
      in a 'low-drive' condition (2-h food deprivation), and also after a motivational 
      shift to a 'high-drive' condition (18-h food deprivation). Intra-PFC DAMGO
      (D-[Ala2,N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin; a mu-opioid agonist) and d-amphetamine
      were also tested in both tasks, under the low-drive condition. Intra-PFC M-NX
      nearly eliminated impulsive action in DRL engendered by hunger, at a dose (1 mug)
      that significantly affected neither hunger-induced PR enhancement nor
      hyperactivity. At a higher dose (3 mug), M-NX eliminated impulsive action and
      returned PR breakpoint to low-drive levels. Conversely, intra-PFC DAMGO
      engendered 'high-drive-like' effects: enhancement of PR and impairment of DRL
      performance. Intra-PFC d-amphetamine failed to produce effects in either task.
      These results establish that endogenous PFC opioid transmission is both necessary
      and sufficient for the expression of impulsive action in a high-arousal,
      high-drive appetitive state, and that PFC-based opioid systems enact functionally
      unique effects on food impulsivity and motivation relative to PFC-based monoamine
      systems. Opioid antagonists may represent effective treatments for a range of
      psychiatric disorders with impulsivity features.

      memories: evidence from multivoxel pattern classification.

AB  - Although older adults often show reduced episodic memory accuracy, their ratings 
      of the subjective vividness of their memories often equal or even exceed those of
      young adults. Such findings suggest that young and older adults may
      differentially access and/or weight different kinds of information in making
      vividness judgments. We examined this idea using multivoxel pattern
      classification of fMRI data to measure category representations while
      participants saw and remembered pictures of objects and scenes. Consistent with
      our hypothesis, there were age-related differences in how category
      representations related to the subjective sense of vividness. During remembering,
      older adults' vividness ratings were more related, relative to young adults', to 
      category representations in prefrontal cortex. In contrast, young adults'
      vividness ratings were more related, relative to older adults, to category
      representations in parietal cortex. In addition, category representations were
      more correlated among posterior regions in young than in older adults, whereas
      correlations between PFC and posterior regions did not differ between the 2
      groups. Together, these results are consistent with the idea that young and older
      adults differentially weight different types of information in assessing
      subjective vividness of their memories.

TI  - Activation of corticostriatal circuitry relieves chronic neuropathic pain.
PG  - 5247-59
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3494-14.2015 [doi]
AB  - Neural circuits that determine the perception and modulation of pain remain
      poorly understood. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) provides top-down control of
      sensory and affective processes. While animal and human imaging studies have
      shown that the PFC is involved in pain regulation, its exact role in pain states 
      remains incompletely understood. A key output target for the PFC is the nucleus
      accumbens (NAc), an important component of the reward circuitry. Interestingly,
      recent human imaging studies suggest that the projection from the PFC to the NAc 
      is altered in chronic pain. The function of this corticostriatal projection in
      pain states, however, is not known. Here we show that optogenetic activation of
      the PFC produces strong antinociceptive effects in a rat model (spared nerve
      injury model) of persistent neuropathic pain. PFC activation also reduces the
      affective symptoms of pain. Furthermore, we show that this pain-relieving
      function of the PFC is likely mediated by projections to the NAc. Thus, our
      results support a novel role for corticostriatal circuitry in pain regulation.

TI  - Differential response of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes in
      the rat prefrontal cortex following ethanol self-administration.
PG  - 650-8
LID - 10.1111/acer.12683 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction is believed to contribute to the 
      transition from controlled substance use to abuse. Because astrocytes have been
      suggested to play a key role in the development and maintenance of drug-seeking
      behaviors, we sought to determine whether PFC astrocytes are affected by ethanol 
      (EtOH) self-administration. METHODS: EtOH consumption was modeled in rats by 3
      self-administration paradigms where EtOH was made concurrently available with
      water in the home cage either continuously (CEA) or intermittently (IEA). In the 
      third paradigm, EtOH was only available in the operant chamber (OEA). To avoid
      the potential confound of acute EtOH effects, all rats were sacrificed after
      either 24-hour or 3-week abstinence. In all groups, the effect of EtOH
      consumption on PFC astrocytes was measured using unbiased stereological counting 
      of cells expressing the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). 
      GFAP immunoreactivity commonly changes in response to pharmacological insult or
      injury. RESULTS: GFAP-positive astrocyte number increased in the prelimbic and
      anterior cingulate cortex regions of the PFC after IEA. No change was found in
      the infralimbic or orbitofrontal cortex after IEA. After 3-week abstinence, there
      was a reduction of astrocytes in the prelimbic and orbitofrontal cortex of the
      CEA cohort as well as a reduction in the orbitofrontal cortex of the OEA cohort. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that discrete PFC subregions contain
      GFAP-positive astrocyte populations that respond differentially to distinct EtOH 
      consumption paradigms. A better understanding of how specific astrocyte
      populations uniquely adapt to EtOH consumption could provide insight for targeted
      therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Repeated ethanol exposure and withdrawal in mice increases voluntary drinking and
      represents an animal model of physical dependence. We examined time- and brain
      region-dependent changes in gene coexpression networks in amygdala (AMY), nucleus
      accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and liver after four weekly cycles of
      chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure in C57BL/6J mice. Microarrays
      were used to compare gene expression profiles at 0-, 8-, and 120-hours following 
      the last ethanol exposure. Each brain region exhibited a large number of
      differentially expressed genes (2,000-3,000) at the 0- and 8-hour time points,
      but fewer changes were detected at the 120-hour time point (400-600). Within each
      region, there was little gene overlap across time (~20%). All brain regions were 
      significantly enriched with differentially expressed immune-related genes at the 
      8-hour time point. Weighted gene correlation network analysis identified modules 
      that were highly enriched with differentially expressed genes at the 0- and
      8-hour time points with virtually no enrichment at 120 hours. Modules enriched
      for both ethanol-responsive and cell-specific genes were identified in each brain
      region. These results indicate that chronic alcohol exposure causes global
      'rewiring' of coexpression systems involving glial and immune signaling as well
      as neuronal genes.

TI  - Gender differences in sleep deprivation effects on risk and inequality aversion: 
      evidence from an economic experiment.
PG  - e0120029
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0120029 [doi]
AB  - Excessive working hours--even at night--are becoming increasingly common in our
      modern 24/7 society. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is particularly vulnerable to
      the effects of sleep loss and, consequently, the specific behaviors subserved by 
      the functional integrity of the PFC, such as risk-taking and pro-social behavior,
      may be affected significantly. This paper seeks to assess the effects of one
      night of sleep deprivation on subjects' risk and social preferences, which are
      probably the most explored behavioral domains in the tradition of Experimental
      Economics. This novel cross-over study employs thirty-two university students
      (gender-balanced) participating to 2 counterbalanced laboratory sessions in which
      they perform standard risk and social preference elicitation protocols. One
      session was after one night of undisturbed sleep at home, and the other was after
      one night of sleep deprivation in the laboratory. Sleep deprivation causes
      increased sleepiness and decreased alertness in all subjects. After sleep loss
      males make riskier decisions compared to the rested condition, while females do
      the opposite. Females likewise show decreased inequity aversion after sleep
      deprivation. As for the relationship between cognitive ability and economic
      decisions, sleep deprived individuals with higher cognitive reflection show lower
      risk aversion and more altruistic behavior. These results show that one night of 
      sleep deprivation alters economic behavior in a gender-sensitive way. Females'
      reaction to sleep deprivation, characterized by reduced risky choices and
      increased egoism compared to males, may be related to intrinsic psychological
      gender differences, such as in the way men and women weigh up probabilities in
      their decision-making, and/or to the different neurofunctional substrate of their
      decision-making.

TI  - Effects of chronic REM sleep restriction on D1 receptor and related signal
      pathways in rat prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 978236
LID - 10.1155/2015/978236 [doi]
AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediates cognitive function that is sensitive to
      disruption by sleep loss, and molecular mechanisms regulating neural dysfunction 
      induced by chronic sleep restriction (CSR), particularly in the PFC, have yet to 
      be completely understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
      effect of chronic REM sleep restriction (REM-CSR) on the D1 receptor (D1R) and
      key molecules in D1R' signal pathways in PFC. We employed the modified multiple
      platform method to create the REM-CSR rat model. The ultrastructure of PFC was
      observed by electron microscopy. HPLC was performed to measure the DA level in
      PFC. The expressions of genes and proteins of related molecules were assayed by
      real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The general state and morphology of
      PFC in rats were changed by CSR, and DA level and the expression of D1R in PFC
      were markedly decreased (P < 0.01, P < 0.05); the expression of
      phosphor-PKAcalpha was significantly lowered in CSR rats (P < 0.05). The present 
      results suggested that the alteration of neuropathology and D1R expression in PFC

AB  - This study investigated the applicability of bulk organic parameters like
      dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), and total
      fluorescence (TF) to act as surrogates in predicting trace organic compound
      (TOrC) removal by granular activated carbon in water reuse applications. Using
      rapid small-scale column testing, empirical linear correlations for thirteen
      TOrCs were determined with DOC, UV254, and TF in four wastewater effluents.
      Linear correlations (R(2) > 0.7) were obtained for eight TOrCs in each water
      quality in the UV254 model, while ten TOrCs had R(2) > 0.7 in the TF model.
      Conversely, DOC was shown to be a poor surrogate for TOrC breakthrough
      prediction. When the data from all four water qualities was combined, good linear
      correlations were still obtained with TF having higher R(2) than UV254 especially
      for TOrCs with log Dow>1. Excellent linear relationship (R(2) > 0.9) between log 
      Dow and the removal of TOrC at 0% surrogate removal (y-intercept) were obtained
      for the five neutral TOrCs tested in this study. Positively charged TOrCs had
      enhanced removals due to electrostatic interactions with negatively charged GAC
      that caused them to deviate from removals that would be expected with their log
      Dow. Application of the empirical linear correlation models to full-scale samples
      provided good results for six of seven TOrCs (except meprobamate) tested when
      comparing predicted TOrC removal by UV254 and TF with actual removals for GAC in 
      all the five samples tested. Surrogate predictions using UV254 and TF provide
      valuable tools for rapid or on-line monitoring of GAC performance and can result 
      in cost savings by extended GAC run times as compared to using DOC breakthrough
      to trigger regeneration or replacement.

AB  - Mixing two fluids together within a microfluidic device still remains a
      challenging operation today. In order to achieve this goal, a number of effective
      micromixers have been developed over the years based on the use of either passive
      or active systems. Typically, passive mixers require no external energy, are more
      robust, and are easy to manufacture albeit they are poorly flexible. Active
      mixers, on the other hand, rely on external disturbance and are thus more
      difficult to use but are proven to have greater efficacy. Here, we report a
      particularly effective, remotely induced and switchable microfluidic mixer, which
      relies on the concomitant use of ultrasound and a perfluorocarbon (PFC) phase,
      with the latter benefiting from its immiscibility with most fluids and its low
      boiling point. More specifically, our approach is based on localized vaporization
      of a PFC phase at the focal zone of a transducer leading to efficient mixing of
      two adjacent fluids. The results show that mixing occurs ~100 ms following the
      delivery of the acoustic pulse, while a laminar flow is re-established on roughly
      the same time scale. Overall, this method is simple and effective, does not
      require tailored channel geometries, is compatible with both hydrophilic and
      hydrophobic microfluidic systems, and is applicable to a wide range of Reynolds
      numbers (10(-4) < Re < 2.10(0)), and the PFC phase can be easily separated from
      the mixed phase at the end of the run.

AB  - Knowledge of online functional brain mechanisms of locomotion is scarce due to
      technical limitations of traditional neuroimaging methods. Using functional Near 
      Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) we evaluated task-related changes in oxygenated
      hemoglobin levels (HbO2) in real-time over the pre-frontal-cortex (PFC) regions
      during simple (Normal Walk; NW) and attention-demanding (Walking While Talking;
      WWT) locomotion tasks in a large cohort of non-demented older adults. Results
      revealed that the assessment of task-related changes in HbO2 was internally
      consistent. Imposing greater demands on the attention system during locomotion
      resulted in robust bilateral PFC increases in HbO2 levels during WWT compared to 
      NW and the cognitive interference tasks. Elevated PFC oxygenation levels were
      maintained throughout the course of WWT but not during the NW condition.
      Increased oxygenation levels in the PFC were related to greater stride length and
      better cognitive performance but not to faster gait velocity in WWT. These
      findings elucidate online brain mechanisms of locomotion, and confer significant 
      implications for risk assessment and intervention for major mobility outcomes.

AB  - Neonatal prefrontal cortex (nPFC) lesions in rats could be a potential animal
      model to study the early neurodevelopmental abnormalities associated with the
      behavioral and morphological brain changes observed in schizophrenia.
      Morphological alterations in pyramidal neurons from the ventral hippocampus (VH) 
      have been observed in post-mortem schizophrenic brains, mainly because of
      decreased dendritic arbor and spine density. We assessed the effects of
      nPFC-lesions on the dendritic morphology of neurons from the VH,
      basolateral-amygdala (BLA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in rats. nPFC lesions
      were made on postnatal day 7 (PD7), after dendritic morphology was studied by the
      Golgi-Cox stain procedure followed by Sholl analysis at PD35 (prepubertal) and
      PD60 (adult) ages. We also evaluated the effects of PFC-lesions on locomotor
      activity caused by a novel environment. Adult animals with nPFC lesions showed a 
      decreased spine density in pyramidal neurons from the VH and in medium spiny
      cells from the NAcc. An increased locomotion was observed in a novel environment 
      for adult animals with a PFC-lesion. Our results indicate that PFC-lesions alter 
      the neuronal dendrite morphology of the NAcc and the VH, suggesting a
      disconnection between these limbic structures. The locomotion paradigms suggest
      that dopaminergic transmission is altered in the PFC lesion model. This could
      help to understand the consequences of an earlier PFC dysfunction in
      schizophrenia. To evaluate possible dendritic changes in neonatal prefrontal
      cortex lesions in schizophrenia-related regions including nucleus accumbens,
      ventral hippocampus and basolateral amygdala, we used the Golgi-Cox stain samples
      at PD35 and PD70. Our results suggest that neonatal prefrontal cortex damage
      alters dendritic parameters in limbic regions, and this has potential
      implications for schizophrenia.

LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00802 [doi]
AB  - Real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback (NF) facilitates volitional control over
      brain activity and the modulation of associated mental functions. The NF signals 
      of traditional rtfMRI-NF studies predominantly reflect neuronal activity within
      ROIs. In this study, we describe a novel rtfMRI-NF approach that includes a
      functional connectivity (FC) component in the NF signal (FC-added rtfMRI-NF). We 
      estimated the efficacy of the FC-added rtfMRI-NF method by applying it to
      nicotine-dependent heavy smokers in an effort to reduce cigarette craving. ACC
      and medial pFC as well as the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus are
      associated with cigarette craving and were chosen as ROIs. Fourteen heavy smokers
      were randomly assigned to receive one of two types of NF: traditional
      activity-based rtfMRI-NF or FC-added rtfMRI-NF. Participants received rtfMRI-NF
      training during two separate visits after overnight smoking cessation, and
      cigarette craving score was assessed. The FC-added rtfMRI-NF resulted in greater 
      neuronal activity and increased FC between the targeted ROIs than the traditional
      activity-based rtfMRI-NF and resulted in lower craving score. In the FC-added
      rtfMRI-NF condition, the average of neuronal activity and FC was tightly
      associated with craving score (Bonferroni-corrected p = .028). However, in the
      activity-based rtfMRI-NF condition, no association was detected (uncorrected p > 
      .081). Non-rtfMRI data analysis also showed enhanced neuronal activity and FC
      with FC-added NF than with activity-based NF. These results demonstrate that
      FC-added rtfMRI-NF facilitates greater volitional control over brain activity and
      connectivity and greater modulation of mental function than activity-based
      rtfMRI-NF.

TI  - Resting-state functional connectivity of antero-medial prefrontal cortex
      sub-regions in major depression and relationship to emotional intelligence.
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyu112 [doi]
LID - pyu112 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder has been associated with abnormal
      resting-state functional connectivity (FC), especially in cognitive processing
      and emotional regulation networks. Although studies have found abnormal FC in
      regions of the default mode network (DMN), no study has investigated the FC of
      specific regions within the anterior DMN based on cytoarchitectonic subdivisions 
      of the antero-medial pre-frontal cortex (PFC). Studies from different areas in
      the field have shown regions within the anterior DMN to be involved in emotional 
      intelligence. Although abnormalities in this region have been observed in
      depression, the relationship between the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) function and
      emotional intelligence has yet to be investigated in depressed individuals.
      METHODS: Twenty-one medication-free, non-treatment resistant, depressed patients 
      and 21 healthy controls underwent a resting state functional magnetic resonance
      imaging session. The participants also completed an ability-based measure of
      emotional intelligence: the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. FC 
      maps of Brodmann areas (BA) 25, 10 m, 10r, and 10p were created and compared
      between the two groups. RESULTS: Mixed-effects analyses showed that the more
      anterior seeds encompassed larger areas of the DMN. Compared to healthy controls,
      depressed patients had significantly lower connectivity between BA10p and the
      right insula and between BA25 and the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex.
      Exploratory analyses showed an association between vmPFC connectivity and
      emotional intelligence. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that individuals with 
      depression have reduced FC between antero-medial PFC regions and regions involved
      in emotional regulation compared to control subjects. Moreover, vmPFC functional 
      connectivity appears linked to emotional intelligence.

TI  - Lyar Is a New Ligand for Retinal Pigment Epithelial Phagocytosis.
PG  - 2177-87
LID - 10.1002/jcb.25089 [doi]
AB  - Phagocytosis is critical to tissue homeostasis, as highlighted by phagocytosis
      defect of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells with debris accumulation,
      photoreceptor degeneration and blindness. Phagocytosis ligands are the key to
      delineating molecular mechanisms and functional roles of phagocytes, but are
      traditionally identified in individual cases with technical challenges. We
      recently developed open reading frame phage display (OPD) for phagocytosis-based 
      functional cloning (PFC) to identify unknown ligands. One of the identified
      ligands was Ly-1 antibody reactive clone (Lyar) with functions poorly defined.
      Herein, we characterized Lyar as a new ligand to stimulate RPE phagocytosis. In
      contrast to its reported nucleolar expression, immunohistochemistry showed that
      Lyar was highly expressed in photoreceptor outer segments (POSs) of the retina.
      Cytoplasmic Lyar was released from apoptotic cells, and selectively bound to shed
      POSs and apoptotic cells, but not healthy cells. POS vesicles engulfed through
      Lyar-dependent pathway were targeted to phagosomes and colocalized with phagosome
      marker Rab7. These results suggest that Lyar is a genuine RPE phagocytosis
      ligand, which in turn supports the validity of OPD/PFC as the only available
      approach for unbiased identification of phagocytosis ligands with broad
      applicability to various phagocytes.

TI  - Monocyte imaging after myocardial infarction with 19F MRI at 3 T: a pilot study
      in explanted porcine hearts.
PG  - 612-20
LID - 10.1093/ehjci/jev008 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Inflammation is a hallmark of cardiac healing after myocardial infarction
      and it determines subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of
      the present study was to explore whether inflammation imaging with two
      perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoemulsions and fluorine magnetic resonance imaging
      ((19)F MRI) is feasible at 3.0 T with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
      using explanted hearts, an (19)F surface coil and dedicated MR sequences. METHODS
      AND RESULTS: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was induced by balloon angioplasty
      (50 min) of the distal left anterior descending artery in 12 pigs. One day
      thereafter, PFCs were injected intravenously to label circulating monocytes.
      Either emulsified perfluoro-15-crown-5 ether or already clinically applied
      perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) was applied. Four days after AMI and immediately
      after gadolinium administration, hearts were explanted and imaged with a 3.0 T
      Achieva MRI scanner. (19)F MRI could be acquired with an SNR of >15 using an
      in-plane resolution of 2 x 2 mm(2) within <20 min for both agents. Combined late 
      gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and (19)F MRI revealed that (19)F signal was
      inhomogenously distributed across LGE myocardium reflecting patchy macrophage
      infiltration as confirmed by histology. In whole hearts, we found an apico-basal 
      (19)F gradient within LGE-positive myocardium. The (19)F-positive volume was
      always smaller than LGE volume. Ex vivo experiments on isolated monocytes
      revealed that pig and human cells phagocytize PFCs even more avidly than mouse
      monocytes. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrates that (19)F MRI at 3.0 T with
      clinically applicable PFOB is feasible, thus highlighting the potential of (19)F 
      MRI to monitor the inflammatory response after AMI.

TI  - Dopamine receptor D1 but not D3 essential for morphine-induced conditioned
      responses.
PG  - 180-9
LID - 10.4238/2015.January.16.1 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies indicate the involvement of dopamine receptors D1 and D3 in the
      regulation of locomotor stimulant and conditioned responses to morphine in mice. 
      Moreover, expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be modulated
      by D1 and D3 receptor activities in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal
      cortex (PFC). However, the underlying interactions between D1 and D3 receptors
      and BDNF in the expression of behavioral responses controlled by drug-associated 
      cues have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we used dopamine receptor
      mutant mice to explore the roles of the D1 and D3 receptors in locomotion and
      morphine-induced place preference; furthermore, we investigated the effects of
      morphine on BDNF expression in the NAc and PFC of the mouse brain. Our results
      show that D1 receptor but not D3 receptor mutant mice had decreased sensitivity
      to acute morphine-induced (10 mg/kg) locomotion (D1: 3814.82 +/- 319.9 cm vs D3: 
      8089.64 +/- 967.4 cm). Furthermore, D1 receptor mutant mice did not acquire
      morphine-conditioned place preference (D1: -18.3 +/- 59.9, D3: 217.7 +/- 64.1)
      and showed decreased BDNF expression in the NAc (D1: 0.33 +/- 0.07 fold, D3: 2.21
      +/- 0.18 fold) and PFC (D1: 0.74 +/- 0.15 fold, D3: 1.68 +/- 0.22 fold) compared 
      with wild-type and D3 receptor mutant mice. These findings suggest that the D1
      receptor is necessary for the induction of cue-associated morphine seeking and
      modulates locomotor habituation processes in response to acute morphine. The
      dopamine receptor D1 but not the D3 is also critical for morphine-induced BDNF
      expression in the NAc and PFC.

TI  - Cell-attached single-channel recordings in intact prefrontal cortex pyramidal
      neurons reveal compartmentalized D1/D5 receptor modulation of the persistent
      sodium current.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.3389/fncir.2015.00004 [doi]
AB  - The persistent Na(+) current (I(Nap)) is believed to be an important target of
      dopamine modulation in prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons. While past studies have
      tested the effects of dopamine on I(Nap), the results have been contradictory
      largely because of difficulties in measuring I(Nap) using somatic whole-cell
      recordings. To circumvent these confounds we used the cell-attached patch-clamp
      technique to record single Na(+) channels from the soma, proximal dendrite (PD)
      or proximal axon (PA) of intact prefrontal layer V pyramidal neurons. Under
      baseline conditions, numerous well resolved Na(+) channel openings were recorded 
      that exhibited an extrapolated reversal potential of 73 mV, a slope conductance
      of 14-19 pS and were blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX). While similar in most
      respects, the propensity to exhibit prolonged bursts lasting >40 ms was many fold
      greater in the axon than the soma or dendrite. Bath application of the D1/D5
      receptor agonist SKF81297 shifted the ensemble current activation curve leftward 
      and increased the number of late events recorded from the PD but not the soma or 
      PA. However, the greatest effect was on prolonged bursting where the D1/D5
      receptor agonist increased their occurrence 3 fold in the PD and nearly 7 fold in
      the soma, but not at all in the PA. As a result, D1/D5 receptor activation
      equalized the probability of prolonged burst occurrence across the proximal
      axosomatodendritic region. Therefore, D1/D5 receptor modulation appears to be
      targeted mainly to Na(+) channels in the PD/soma and not the PA. By circumventing
      the pitfalls of previous attempts to study the D1/D5 receptor modulation of
      I(Nap), we demonstrate conclusively that D1/D5 receptor activation can increase
      the I(Nap) generated proximally, however questions still remain as to how D1/D5
      receptor modulates Na(+) currents in the more distal initial segment where most
      of the I Nap is normally generated.

TI  - Overexpression of Protein Kinase Mzeta in the Prelimbic Cortex Enhances the
      Formation of Long-Term Fear Memory.
PG  - 2146-56
LID - 10.1038/npp.2015.56 [doi]
AB  - Neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) after fear conditioning has been
      suggested to regulate the formation and expression of fear memory. Protein kinase
      Mzeta (PKMzeta), an isoform of protein kinase C with persistent activity, is
      involved in the formation and maintenance of memory. However, less is known about
      the role of PKMzeta in the PFC in the formation of fear memory. We investigated
      whether the overexpression of PKMzeta enhances the formation of auditory fear
      memory in rats. We found that microinfusion of lentiviral vector-expressing
      PKMzeta into the prelimbic cortex (PrL) selectively enhanced the expression of
      PKMzeta without influencing the expression of other isoforms of PKC. The
      overexpression of PKMzeta in the PrL enhanced the formation of long-term fear
      memory without affecting short-term fear memory, whereas the overexpression of
      PKMzeta in the infralimbic cortex had no effect on either short-term or long-term
      fear memory. The overexpression of PKMzeta in the PrL had no effect on
      anxiety-like behavior or locomotor activity. We also found that PKMzeta
      overexpression potentiated the fear conditioning-induced increase in the membrane
      levels of glutamate subunit 2 of AMPA receptors in the PrL. These results
      demonstrate that the overexpression of PKMzeta in the PrL but not infralimbic
      cortex selectively enhanced the formation of long-term fear memory, and PKMzeta
      in the PrL may be involved in the formation of fear memory.

AB  - The dopamine transporter (DAT1) gene has been associated with impulsivity and
      executive functioning. Further, DAT1 has been associated with brain structural
      characteristics and resting state connectivity. This study tested an indirect
      effect model in which DAT1 genotype (9-repeat (9R) carriers vs 10-repeat (10R)
      homozygotes) is linked to phenotypes representing impulsivity and executive
      function (planning behavior) through effects on white matter (WM) volumes in
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Adolescents
      (ages 14-18, n=38) were recruited from substance use treatment (n=22) and the
      community (n=16) to increase phenotype variation. Results indicated that DAT1
      10/10 genotype was associated with lower WM volume in the PFC, specifically the
      left OFC. Further, lower WM volume in the left OFC predicted more difficulties in
      self-reported planning behavior, but not impulsivity. Indirect effect analysis
      indicated that lower WM volume in the left OFC mediated the association between
      DAT1 10/10 genotype and difficulties in planning behavior. Results suggest a
      brain structural mechanism, involving lower WM volume in the left OFC, as a link 
      in the association between DAT1 genotype and a specific aspect of executive
      function. Genetic effects on regional WM volume that are linked to behavioral
      outcomes could ultimately inform the development of tailored interventions that
      address an individuals unique risk factors.

TI  - The IFNgamma-PKR pathway in the prefrontal cortex reactions to chronic excessive 
      alcohol use.
PG  - 476-84
LID - 10.1111/acer.12650 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain cell death is a major pathological consequence of alcohol
      neurotoxicity. However, the molecular cascades in alcohol-induced brain tissue
      injury are unclear. METHODS: Using Western blot and double immunofluorescence, we
      examined the expression of interferon (IFN)-induced protein kinase R (PKR),
      phosphorylated-PKR (p-PKR), and IFN gamma (IFNgamma) in the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) of postmortem brains from subjects with alcohol use disorders (AUD).
      RESULTS: The protein levels of PKR, p-PKR, and IFNgamma were significantly
      increased in subjects with AUD compared with control subjects without AUD, and a 
      younger age of onset of AUD was significantly correlated with higher protein
      levels of p-PKR. In addition, elevated PKR- and p-PKR-IR were observed in both
      neurons and astrocytes in the PFC of subjects with AUD compared to subjects
      without AUD. CONCLUSIONS: The activation of the IFNgamma-PKR pathway in PFC of
      humans is associated with chronic excessive ethanol use with an age of onset
      dependent manner, and activation of this pathway may play a pivotal role in
      AUD-related brain tissue injury. This study provides insight into
      neurodegenerative key factors related to AUD and identifies potential targets for
      the treatment of alcohol-induced neurotoxicity.

      adults with familial risk for psychosis - Oulu Brain and Mind Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social interaction requires mirroring to other people's mental state.
      Psychotic disorders have been connected to social interaction and emotion
      recognition impairment. We compared the brain activity between young adults with 
      familial risk for psychosis (FR) and matched controls during visual exposure to
      emotional facial expression. We also investigated the role of the amygdala, the
      key region for social interaction and emotion recognition. METHODS: 51 FR and 52 
      control subjects were drawn from the Northern Finland 1986 Birth Cohort (Oulu
      Brain and Mind Study). None of the included participants had developed psychosis.
      The FR group was defined as having a parent with psychotic disorder according to 
      the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Participants underwent functional MRI
      (fMRI) using visual presentation of dynamic happy and fearful facial expressions.
      FMRI data were processed to produce maps of activation for happy and fearful
      facial expression, which were then compared between groups. Two spherical regions
      of interest (ROIs) in the amygdala were set to extract BOLD responses during
      happy and fearful facial expression. BOLD responses were then compared with
      subjects' emotion recognition, which was assessed after fMRI. Psychophysiological
      interaction (PPI) for the left and right amygdala during happy and fearful facial
      expression was conducted using the amygdala as seed regions. RESULTS: FR subjects
      had increased activity in the left premotor cortex and reduced deactivation of
      medial prefrontal cortex structures during happy facial expression. There were no
      between-group differences during fearful facial expression. The FR group also
      showed a statistically significant linear correlation between mean amygdala BOLD 
      response and facial expression recognition. PPI showed that there was a
      significant negative interaction between the amygdala and the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and superior temporal gyrus in FR subjects.
      CONCLUSIONS: Increased activations by positive valence in FR were in brain
      regions crucial to emotion recognition and social interaction. Increased
      activation of the premotor cortex may serve as a compensatory mechanism as FR
      subjects may have to exert more effort on processing the stimuli, as has been
      found earlier in schizophrenia. Failure to deactivate PFC structures may imply
      error in the default mode network. Abnormal PFC function in FR was also suggested
      by PPI, as the dlPFC showed decreased functional connectivity with the amygdala
      in the FR group. This may indicate that in FR subjects the amygdala have to take 
      a greater role in emotion recognition and social functioning. This inference was 
      supported by our discovery of statistically significant correlations between the 
      amygdala BOLD response and emotion recognition in the FR group but not in
      controls.

      one type over the other. This study used a combined finite element (FE)
      simulation and principal component analysis (PCA) to evaluate "reliability" and
      "sensitivity" of two PS designs versus two CR designs over a patient population. 
      Four fixed bearing implants were chosen: PFC (DePuy), PFC Sigma (DePuy), NexGen
      (Zimmer) and Genesis II (Smith & Nephew). Using PCA, a large probabilistic knee
      joint motion and loading database was generated based on the available
      experimental data from literature. The probabilistic knee joint data were applied
      to each implant in a FE simulation to calculate the potential envelopes of
      kinematics (i.e. anterior-posterior [AP] displacement and internal-external [IE] 
      rotation) and contact mechanics. The performance envelopes were considered as an 
      indicator of performance reliability. For each implant, PCA was used to highlight
      how much the implant performance was influenced by changes in each input
      parameter (sensitivity). Results showed that (1) conformity directly affected the
      reliability of the knee implant over a patient population such that lesser
      conformity designs (PS or CR), had higher kinematic variability and were more
      influenced by AP force and IE torque, (2) contact reliability did not differ
      noticeably among different designs and (3) CR or PS designs affected the relative
      rank of critical factors that influenced the reliability of each design. Such
      investigations enlighten the underlying biomechanics of various implant designs
      and can be utilized to estimate the potential performance of an implant design
      over a patient population.

TI  - Depression of excitatory synapses onto parvalbumin interneurons in the medial
      prefrontal cortex in susceptibility to stress.

LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2670-14.2015 [doi]
AB  - In response to extreme stress, individuals either show resilience or succumb to
      despair. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is required for coping with stress, and PFC 
      dysfunction has been implicated in stress-related mental disorders, including
      depression. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which the PFC participates in stress 
      responses remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of parvalbumin (PV)
      interneurons in the medial PFC (mPFC) in shaping behavioral responses to stress
      induced by the learned helplessness procedure, in which animals are subjected to 
      an unpredictable and inescapable stressor. PV interneurons in the mPFC were
      probed and manipulated in knock-in mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the 
      endogenous parvalbumin promoter. Notably, we found that excitatory synaptic
      transmission onto these neurons was decreased in mice showing helplessness, a
      behavioral state that is thought to resemble features of human depression.
      Furthermore, selective suppression of PV interneurons in the mPFC using hM4Di, a 
      DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug), promoted
      helplessness, indicating that activation of these neurons during stress promotes 
      the establishment of resilient behavior. Our results reveal a cellular mechanism 
      of mPFC dysfunction that may contribute to the emergence of maladaptive
      behavioral responses in the face of adverse life events.

TI  - Mapping of functionally characterized cell classes onto canonical circuit
      operations in primate prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 2975-91
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2700-14.2015 [doi]
AB  - Microcircuits are composed of multiple cell classes that likely serve unique
      circuit operations. But how cell classes map onto circuit functions is largely
      unknown, particularly for primate prefrontal cortex during actual goal-directed
      behavior. One difficulty in this quest is to reliably distinguish cell classes in
      extracellular recordings of action potentials. Here we surmount this issue and
      report that spike shape and neural firing variability provide reliable markers to
      segregate seven functional classes of prefrontal cells in macaques engaged in an 
      attention task. We delineate an unbiased clustering protocol that identifies four
      broad spiking (BS) putative pyramidal cell classes and three narrow spiking (NS) 
      putative inhibitory cell classes dissociated by how sparse, bursty, or regular
      they fire. We speculate that these functional classes map onto canonical circuit 
      functions. First, two BS classes show sparse, bursty firing, and phase
      synchronize their spiking to 3-7 Hz (theta) and 12-20 Hz (beta) frequency bands
      of the local field potential (LFP). These properties make cells flexibly
      responsive to network activation at varying frequencies. Second, one NS and two
      BS cell classes show regular firing and higher rate with only marginal
      synchronization preference. These properties are akin to setting tonically the
      excitation and inhibition balance. Finally, two NS classes fired irregularly and 
      synchronized to either theta or beta LFP fluctuations, tuning them potentially to
      frequency-specific subnetworks. These results suggest that a limited set of
      functional cell classes emerges in macaque prefrontal cortex (PFC) during
      attentional engagement to not only represent information, but to subserve basic
      circuit operations.

TI  - Prenatal alcohol exposure alters steady-state and activated gene expression in
      the adult rat brain.
PG  - 251-61
LID - 10.1111/acer.12622 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is associated with alterations in
      numerous physiological systems, including the stress and immune systems. We have 
      previously shown that PAE increases the course and severity of arthritis in an
      adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) model. While the molecular mechanisms underlying 
      these effects are not fully known, changes in neural gene expression are emerging
      as important factors in the etiology of PAE effects. As the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) play key roles in neuroimmune function, PAE-induced
      alterations to their transcriptome may underlie abnormal steady-state functions
      and responses to immune challenge. This study examined brains from adult PAE and 
      control females from our recent AA study to determine whether PAE causes
      long-term alterations in gene expression and whether these mediate the altered
      severity and course of arthritis in PAE females. METHODS: Adult females from PAE,
      pair-fed (PF), and ad libitum-fed control (C) groups were injected with either
      saline or complete Freund's adjuvant. Animals were terminated at the peak of
      inflammation or during resolution (Days 16 and 39 postinjection, respectively);
      cohorts of saline-injected PAE, PF, and C females were terminated in parallel.
      Gene expression was analyzed in the PFC and HPC using whole-genome mRNA
      expression microarrays. RESULTS: Significant changes in gene expression in both
      the PFC and HPC were found in PAE compared to controls in response to ethanol
      exposure alone (saline-injected females), including genes involved in
      neurodevelopment, apoptosis, and energy metabolism. Moreover, in response to
      inflammation (adjuvant-injected females), PAE animals showed unique expression
      patterns, while failing to exhibit the activation of genes and regulators
      involved in the immune response observed in control and pair-fed animals.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that PAE affects neuroimmune
      function at the level of gene expression, demonstrating long-term effects of PAE 
      on the central nervous system response under steady-state conditions and
      following an inflammatory insult.

TI  - Assessment of cerebral blood flow in patients with multiple chemical sensitivity 
      using near-infrared spectroscopy--recovery after olfactory stimulation: a
      case-control study.
PG  - 185-94
LID - 10.1007/s12199-015-0448-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a chronic acquired disorder
      characterized by non-specific symptoms in multiple organ systems associated with 
      exposure to odorous chemicals. We previously observed significant activations in 
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during olfactory stimulation using several different 
      odorants in patients with MCS by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) imaging. We
      also observed that the patients with MCS did not adequately distinguish
      non-odorant in the late stage of the repeated olfactory stimulation test. The
      sensory recovery of the olfactory system in the patients with MCS may process
      odors differently from healthy subjects after olfactory stimulation. METHODS: We 
      examined the recovery process of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) after
      olfactory stimulation in patients with MCS. NIRS imaging was performed in 6
      patients with MCS and in 6 controls. The olfactory stimulation test was
      continuously repeated 10 times. The study also included a subjective assessment
      of the physical and psychological status and of the perception of irritating and 
      hedonic odors. RESULTS: After olfactory stimulation, significant activations were
      observed in the PFC of patients with MCS on both the right and left sides
      compared with controls. The activations were specifically strong in the
      orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Compared with controls, autonomic perception and
      feelings identification were poorer in patients with MCS. OFC is associated with 
      stimuli response and the representation of preferences. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest that a past strong exposure to hazardous chemicals activates the 
      PFC during olfactory stimuli in patients with MCS, and a strong activation in the
      OFC remains after the stimuli.

TI  - The Role of the Two-Pore Domain Potassium Channel TREK-1 in the Therapeutic
      Effects of Escitalopram in a Rat Model of Poststroke Depression.
PG  - 504-12
LID - 10.1111/cns.12384 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Poststroke depression (PSD) is one of the most common neuropsychiatric
      complications after stroke. TREK-1, a two-pore-domain potassium channel, has been
      implicated in the pathogenesis of stroke and depression. The aim of this study
      was to investigate whether TREK-1 plays a role in the therapeutic effects of the 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram in a rat PSD model.
      METHODS: The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was performed to assess the effect 
      of escitalopram on recombinant TREK-1 currents in HEK293 cells. The expression of
      TREK-1 mRNA and protein was measured in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex
      (PFC), and neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation was detected in the hippocampal
      dentate gyrus (DG) in PSD rats after 3 weeks of escitalopram administration.
      RESULTS: Escitalopram reversibly inhibited TREK-1 currents in a
      concentration-dependent manner. Chronic treatment with escitalopram significantly
      reversed the reductions in weight gain, locomotor activity, and sucrose
      preference in PSD rats. The expressions of TREK-1 mRNA and protein were
      significantly increased in hippocampal CA1, CA3, DG, and PFC in PSD rats, with
      the exception of TREK-1 mRNA in hippocampal CA1. NSC proliferation was
      significantly decreased in hippocampal DG of PSD rats. Escitalopram significantly
      reversed the regional increases of TREK-1 expression and the reduction of
      hippocampal NSC proliferation in PSD rats. CONCLUSION: TREK-1 plays an important 
      role in the therapeutic effects of the SSRI escitalopram in PSD model, making
      TREK-1 an attractive candidate molecule for further understanding the
      pathophysiology and treatment of PSD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists augment cognition
      among cigarette smokers and nonsmokers, yet the systems-level neurobiological
      mechanisms underlying such improvements are not fully understood. Aggregating
      neuroimaging results regarding nAChR agonists provides a means to identify common
      functional brain changes that may be related to procognitive drug effects.
      METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of pharmacologic neuroimaging studies
      within the activation likelihood estimation framework. We identified published
      studies contrasting a nAChR drug condition versus a baseline and coded each
      contrast by activity change direction (decrease or increase), participant
      characteristics (smokers or nonsmokers), and drug manipulation employed
      (pharmacologic administration or cigarette smoking). RESULTS: When considering
      all studies, nAChR agonist administration was associated with activity decreases 
      in multiple regions, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC),
      posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), parahippocampus, insula, and the parietal and
      precentral cortices. Conversely, activity increases were observed in lateral
      frontoparietal cortices, the anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and cuneus.
      Exploratory analyses indicated that both smokers and nonsmokers showed activity
      decreases in the vmPFC and PCC, and increases in lateral frontoparietal regions. 
      Among smokers, both pharmacologic administration and cigarette smoking were
      associated with activity decreases in the vmPFC, PCC, and insula and increases in
      the lateral PFC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and cuneus.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the systems-level perspective that
      nAChR agonists suppress activity in default-mode network regions and enhance
      activity in executive control network regions in addition to reducing activation 
      of some task-related regions. We speculate these are potential mechanisms by
      which nAChR agonists enhance cognition.

AB  - The activation of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) has been shown to be lacking in 
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of patients with late-onset depression (LOD), in
      verbal fluency task (VFT)-related near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). In our
      previous studies, we have emphasized the connection between the lack of
      activation in the frontopolar cortex and social functioning disorder in patients 
      with LOD. In this study, we investigated whether the responsiveness to medical
      treatment of untreated patients with LOD, particularly social functioning
      improvements, could be predicted by NIRS findings at the initial examination. The
      subjects were 29 patients with LOD who were diagnosed with major depression at 65
      years or older at the initial examination (mean age +/- standard deviation, 72.4 
      +/- 5.71 years). We measured the changes in hemoglobin concentration in the
      prefrontal and temporal cortex regions during a VFT by using 52-channel NIRS. In 
      addition, depression status and social functioning were evaluated with the
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale,
      respectively, at the initial examination and 8 weeks after the treatment. A
      negative correlation was found between the NIRS activation in the right
      ventrolateral PFC region before treatment and the improvement in social
      functioning. These results suggested that the social functioning improvements
      were greater in LOD with initially lower NIRS activation in the right
      ventrolateral PFC region. NIRS is a simple technique that can be used before
      treatment to evaluate the social functioning levels of patients with LOD, and
      predict social functioning improvement after treatment.

TI  - Deficits in prefrontal cortical and extrastriatal dopamine release in
      schizophrenia: a positron emission tomographic functional magnetic resonance
      imaging study.
PG  - 316-24
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2014.2414 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Multiple lines of evidence suggest a deficit in dopamine release in
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in schizophrenia. Despite the prevalence of the
      concept of prefrontal cortical hypodopaminergia in schizophrenia, in vivo imaging
      of dopamine release in the PFC has not been possible until now, when the validity
      of using the positron emission tomographic D2/3 radiotracer carbon 11-labeled
      FLB457 in combination with the amphetamine paradigm was clearly established.
      OBJECTIVES: To (1) test amphetamine-induced dopamine release in the dorsolateral 
      PFC (DLPFC) in drug-free or drug-naive patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and
      healthy control (HC) individuals matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
      familial socioeconomic status;(2) test blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
      functional magnetic resonance imaging activation during a working memory task in 
      the same participants; and (3) examine the relationship between positron emission
      tomographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging outcome measures. DESIGN,
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Positron emission tomographic imaging with carbon
      11-labeled FLB457 before and following 0.5 mg/kg of amphetamine by mouth. Blood
      oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging during the
      self-ordered working memory task. Twenty patients with schizophrenia recruited
      from the inpatient and outpatient research facilities at New York State
      Psychiatric Institute and 21 healthy control individuals participated, and data
      were acquired between June 16, 2011, and February 25, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND
      MEASURE: The percentage change in binding potential (BPND) in the DLPFC following
      amphetamine, BOLD activation during the self-ordered working memory task compared
      with the control task, and the correlation between these 2 outcome measures.
      RESULTS: We observed significant differences in the effect of amphetamine on
      DLPFC BPND (mean [SD], BPND in HC: -7.5% [11%]; SCZ: +1.8% [11%]; P = .01); a
      generalized blunting in dopamine release in SCZ involving most extrastriatal
      regions and the midbrain; and a significant association between BPND and BOLD
      activation in the DLPFC in the overall sample including patients with SCZ and HC 
      individuals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, these results provide
      the first in vivo evidence for a deficit in the capacity for dopamine release in 
      the DLPFC in SCZ and suggest a more widespread deficit extending to many cortical
      and extrastriatal regions including the midbrain. This contrasts with the
      well-replicated excess in dopamine release in the associative striatum in SCZ and
      suggests a differential regulation of striatal dopamine release in associative
      striatum vs extrastriatal regions. Furthermore, dopamine release in the DLPFC
      relates to working memory-related activation of this region, suggesting that
      blunted release may affect frontal cortical function.

TI  - Factors affecting ultrasonic release from eLiposomes.
PG  - 1373-84
LID - 10.1002/jps.24344 [doi]
AB  - Liposomes containing emulsion droplets (eLiposomes) were studied as
      ultrasound-responsive liposomal drug carriers. This paper presents the effects of
      temperature, eLiposome size, and ultrasound parameters on the ultrasonically
      actuated release of calcein, to test hypotheses concerning the physics of
      acoustic droplet vaporization with regard to vapor pressure and Laplace pressure.
      Small (200 nm) eLiposomes containing 100-nm emulsion droplets were formed and
      compared with large (800 nm) eLiposomes containing 100- or 450-nm droplets.
      Calcein release was quantified by spectroscopic methods. Various experiments
      examined the influence of perfluorocarbon (PFC) droplet size, vesicle size,
      temperature, PFC composition and vapor pressure, insonation time, and insonation 
      frequency. Results showed that eLiposome samples released significantly more
      calcein than their conventional liposome counterparts. Surprisingly, temperature 
      (which directly controls vapor pressure) did not have a strong effect on
      ultrasound-induced calcein release. In general, calcein release decreased with
      decreasing droplet size, as hypothesized based on Laplace pressure. Release
      decreased with increased ultrasound frequency if the pressure amplitude and
      exposure time were maintained constant, indicating that the gas-phase nucleation 
      rate may have an important role in rupture of eLiposomes. Interestingly, when
      ultrasound of the same mechanical index was applied at two frequencies, the
      amount of release correlated strongly with the mechanical index.

AB  - Anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) abuse is prevalent not only among elite
      athletes, but is increasingly common in high school and collegiate sports. AAS
      are implicated in maladaptive behaviors such as increased aggression and risk
      taking, which may result from impaired cognition. Because they affect dopamine
      function in prefrontal cortical (PFC)-striatal circuitry, AAS may disrupt
      PFC-dependent processes such as behavioral flexibility. This was the focus of the
      present study. Adolescent male Long-Evans rats were treated chronically with
      high-dose testosterone (7.5mg/kg in water with 13% cyclodextrin) or vehicle sc,
      and tested for set-shifting and reversal-learning. For set-shifting, rats were
      trained on a visual cue task (VCT), then were shifted to a direction cue task
      (DCT), or vice-versa. For reversal learning, rats were first trained on VCT and
      were then required to press the opposite lever. 2-cue set-shifting introduced a
      novel paradigm in which rats shifted from a 1-Light Visual Task (1LVT) to a tone 
      cue task (TCT). Testosterone-treated rats were significantly impaired on the
      set-shift from DCT to VCT compared to vehicle-treated controls (trials to
      criterion: vehicle 240.9+/-29.9, testosterone 388.3+/-59.3, p<0.05). However, on 
      the set-shift from VCT to DCT, testosterone did not affect performance. During
      reversal-learning, testosterone significantly increased trials to criterion
      (vehicle: 495.9+/-91.8 trials, testosterone: 793.7+/-96.7 trials, p<0.05). In
      2-cue set-shifting, testosterone diminished performance and the difference showed
      borderline significance (vehicle: 443.2+/-84.4 trials, testosterone:
      800.4+/-178.2 trials, p=0.09). Our results show that testosterone impairs
      behavioral flexibility and have implications for understanding cognitive and
      behavioral changes in human AAS users.

AB  - Modulation of dopamine (DA) released by serotonin-2 (5-HT2) receptors has been
      implicated in the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs. The mesocortical DA
      system has been implicated particularly in the cognitive deficits observed in
      schizophrenia. Agonism at 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is
      associated with increases in cortical DA release. Evidence indicates that 5-HT2A 
      receptors in the cortex regulate mesocortical DA release through stimulation of a
      "long-loop" feedback system from the PFC to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and 
      back. However, a causal role for VTA glutamate in the 5-HT2-induced increases in 
      PFC DA has not been established. The present study does so by measuring 5-HT2
      agonist-induced DA release in the cortex after infusions of glutamate antagonists
      into the VTA of the rat. Infusions of a combination of a N-methyl-d-aspartic acid
      (NMDA) (AP-5: 2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid) and an AMPA/kainate (CNQX:
      6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) receptor antagonist into the VTA blocked
      the increases in cortical DA produced by administration of the 5-HT2 agonist DOI 
      [(+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine] (2.5mg/kg s.c.). These results
      demonstrate that stimulation of glutamate receptors in the VTA is necessary for
      5-HT2 agonist-induced increases in cortical DA.

AB  - Our recent study indicates that the lesions of the prefrontal cortex in rats
      result in depressive-like behavior in forced swim test and REM sleep alterations,
      two well-established biomarkers of depression disorder. We hypothesized that
      antidepressants may target the PFC to reverse depression. Systemic injections of 
      antidepressants: the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (DMI), the selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, and the NMDA-antagonist ketamine
      selectively increased cFos expression (a marker of neuronal activity) in the deep
      layers of the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) in rats. Of the vmPFC's limbic system
      targets, only the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was also activated by DMI. Using a
      retrograde tracer and a neuronal toxin, we also found that DMI-activated vmPFC
      neurons project to the NAc and that NAc activation by DMI was lost following
      vmPFC lesion. These results suggest that the vmPFC may be an essential target of 
      antidepressant drugs, its projections to the NAc may be a key circuit regulating 
      antidepressant action, and dysfunction of this pathway may contribute to
      depression.

AB  - One hundred and eighty Kunming mice were allotted to three groups in a randomized
      complete block design, including two treatments and one control. Mice in group 1 
      were fed a basal diet as control, while mice in groups 2 and 3 were fed the basal
      diet supplemented with 0.2 mg/kg selenium as sodium selenite (SS) or
      selenium-chitosan (SC), respectively. On day 28 of the experiment, blood selenium
      concentration, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, plasma superoxide dismutase
      (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and Con A-induced splenocyte
      proliferation were determined, and plasma interleukin-2 (IL-2) and
      interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) concentrations, splenic plaque-forming cell (PFC)
      responses, serum hemolysis level (HC50), and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) 
      responses were determined on day 15 of the experiment. The results showed that
      blood selenium concentration, GPx activity, splenic PFC response, and plasma IL-2
      and IFN-gamma concentrations in SC group were higher than those in the control
      and SS groups (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), respectively. Plasma SOD activity, Serum
      hemolysis level, DTH responses, and Con A-induced splenocyte proliferation in SC 
      group were higher than those in control (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Plasma SOD
      activity, serum hemolysis level, DTH responses, and Con A-induced splenocyte
      proliferation in SC group were also higher than those in SS group, while there
      was no significant difference between SC and SS groups (P > 0.05). Plasma MDA
      content in SC group was lower than those in the control and SS groups (P < 0.01
      or P < 0.05). It is concluded that SC supplement can increase blood selenium
      concentration, antioxidation status, and cellular and humoral immunity, and SC
      has better biological activity than SS in mice.

TI  - Neural correlates of expected risks and returns in risky choice across
      development.
PG  - 1549-60
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1924-14.2015 [doi]
AB  - Adolescence is often described as a period of increased risk taking relative to
      both childhood and adulthood. This inflection in risky choice behavior has been
      attributed to a neurobiological imbalance between earlier developing motivational
      systems and later developing top-down control regions. Yet few studies have
      decomposed risky choice to investigate the underlying mechanisms or tracked their
      differential developmental trajectory. The current study uses a risk-return
      decomposition to more precisely assess the development of processes underlying
      risky choice and to link them more directly to specific neural mechanisms. This
      decomposition specifies the influence of changing risks (outcome variability) and
      changing returns (expected value) on the choices of children, adolescents, and
      adults in a dynamic risky choice task, the Columbia Card Task. Behaviorally, risk
      aversion increased across age groups, with adults uniformly risk averse and
      adolescents showing substantial individual differences in risk sensitivity,
      ranging from risk seeking to risk averse. Neurally, we observed an adolescent
      peak in risk-related activation in the anterior insula and dorsal medial PFC.
      Return sensitivity, on the other hand, increased monotonically across age groups 
      and was associated with increased activation in the ventral medial PFC and
      posterior cingulate cortex with age. Our results implicate adolescence as a
      developmental phase of increased neural risk sensitivity. Importantly, this work 
      shows that using a behaviorally validated decision-making framework allows a
      precise operationalization of key constructs underlying risky choice that inform 
      the interpretation of results.

TI  - Antidepressant effects of TrkB ligands on depression-like behavior and dendritic 
      changes in mice after inflammation.
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyu077 [doi]
LID - pyu077 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor,
      tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), signaling represent potential therapeutic
      targets for major depressive disorder. The purpose of this study is to examine
      whether TrkB ligands show antidepressant effects in an inflammation-induced model
      of depression. METHODS: In this study, we examined the effects of TrkB agonist
      7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) and TrkB antagonist ANA-12 on depression-like
      behavior and morphological changes in mice previously exposed to
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Protein levels of BDNF, phospho-TrkB (p-TrkB), and TrkB
      in the brain regions were also examined. RESULTS: LPS caused a reduction of BDNF 
      in the CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC),
      whereas LPS increased BDNF in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Dexamethason
      suppression tests showed hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
      in LPS-treated mice. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 7,8-DHF showed
      antidepressant effects on LPS-induced depression-like behavior, and i.p.
      pretreatment with ANA-12 blocked its antidepressant effects. Surprisingly, ANA-12
      alone showed antidepressant-like effects on LPS-induced depression-like behavior.
      Furthermore, bilateral infusion of ANA-12 into the NAc showed antidepressant
      effects. Moreover, LPS caused a reduction of spine density in the CA3, DG, and
      PFC, whereas LPS increased spine density in the NAc. Interestingly, 7,8-DHF
      significantly attenuated LPS-induced reduction of p-TrkB and spine densities in
      the CA3, DG, and PFC, whereas ANA-12 significantly attenuated LPS-induced
      increases of p-TrkB and spine density in the NAc. CONCLUSIONS: The results
      suggest that LPS-induced inflammation may cause depression-like behavior by
      altering BDNF and spine density in the CA3, DG, PFC, and NAc, which may be
      involved in the antidepressant effects of 7,8-DHF and ANA-12, respectively.

TI  - Effects of ceftriaxone on GLT1 isoforms, xCT and associated signaling pathways in
      P rats exposed to ethanol.

AB  - RATIONALE: Several studies have demonstrated a correlation between extracellular 
      glutamate concentration in the mesolimbic reward pathway and alcohol craving.
      Extracellular glutamate concentration is regulated by several glutamate
      transporters. Glial glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1) is one of them that regulates 
      the majority of extracellular glutamate concentration. In addition,
      cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) is another transporter that regulates
      extracellular glutamate. OBJECTIVES: We focus in this study to determine the
      effects of ceftriaxone, beta-lactam antibiotic, on glial proteins such as GLT1
      isoforms, xCT, glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST), and several associated
      signaling pathways as well as ethanol intake in P rats. Additionally, to examine 
      the onset of signaling pathways associated with GLT1 upregulation following
      ceftriaxone treatment, we tested 2- versus 5-day daily dosing of ceftriaxone.
      RESULTS: Ceftriaxone treatment (100 mg/kg), 2 and 5 days, resulted in about five 
      fold reduction in ethanol intake by P rats. The reduction in ethanol intake was
      associated with significantly enhanced expression of GLT1, GLT1a, GLT1b, and xCT 
      in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 5-day
      ceftriaxone-treated P rats. Two-day-treated P rats showed marked changes in
      expression of these glutamate transporters in the PFC but not in the NAc.
      Importantly, ceftriaxone-treated P rats (2 and 5 days) demonstrated enhanced
      phosphorylation of Akt and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappaB
      (NFkappaB) in the NAc and PFC compared to control animals. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings demonstrate that ceftriaxone treatment induced upregulation of GLT1,
      GLT1 isoforms, and xCT in association with activation of the Akt-NFkappaB
      signaling pathway.

AB  - Older adults often show different functional activation patterns than younger
      adults in prefrontal cortex (PFC) when performing cognitive control tasks. These 
      differences include age-related increases in PFC activation magnitude and
      reorganized PFC functional connectivity (fC) patterns. However, it remains
      unclear whether age-related alterations in brain activation patterns reflect a
      positive mechanism (e.g., compensatory response) or a sign of brain dysfunction
      (e.g., reduced efficiency). Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) to compare PFC activation magnitudes and PFC connectivity patterns between
      younger and older adult groups during performance of a task switching paradigm.
      Results indicated age-related increases both in PFC activation magnitudes and in 
      PFC fC with inferotemporal (IT) regions. However, these age-related fMRI
      increases were differentially associated with task performance. Whereas increased
      PFC activation magnitudes tended to be either unrelated to task RT or associated 
      with poorer task performance, increased PFC-IT connectivity was associated with
      better task performance in older adults. Our results suggest that age-related
      reductions in efficiency and successful compensation can co-exist in older adults
      in the context of the same task.

TI  - Distinct frontal lobe morphology in girls and boys with ADHD.
PG  - 222-9
LID - 10.1016/j.nicl.2014.12.010 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether frontal lobe cortical morphology
      differs for boys and girls with ADHD (ages 8-12 years) in comparison to typically
      developing (TD) peers. METHOD: Participants included 226 children between the
      ages of 8-12 including 93 children with ADHD (29 girls) and 133 TD children (42
      girls) for which 3T MPRAGE MRI scans were obtained. A fully automated frontal
      lobe atlas was used to generate functionally distinct frontal subdivisions, with 
      surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT) assessed in each region. Analyses
      focused on overall diagnostic differences as well as examinations of the effect
      of diagnosis within boys and girls. RESULTS: Girls, but not boys, with ADHD
      showed overall reductions in total prefrontal cortex (PFC) SA. Localization
      revealed that girls showed widely distributed reductions in the bilateral
      dorsolateral PFC, left inferior lateral PFC, right medial PFC, right
      orbitofrontal cortex, and left anterior cingulate; and boys showed reduced SA
      only in the right anterior cingulate and left medial PFC. In contrast, boys, but 
      not girls, with ADHD showed overall reductions in total premotor cortex (PMC) SA.
      Further localization revealed that in boys, premotor reductions were observed in 
      bilateral lateral PMC regions; and in girls reductions were observed in bilateral
      supplementary motor complex. In line with diagnostic group differences, PMC and
      PFC SAs were inversely correlated with symptom severity in both girls and boys
      with ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: These results elucidate sex-based differences in cortical
      morphology of functional subdivisions of the frontal lobe and provide additional 
      evidence of associations among SA and symptom severity in children with ADHD.

TI  - The default mode of human brain function primes the intentional stance.
PG  - 1116-24
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00785 [doi]
AB  - Humans readily adopt an intentional stance to other people, comprehending their
      behavior as guided by unobservable mental states such as belief, desire, and
      intention. We used fMRI in healthy adults to test the hypothesis that this stance
      is primed by the default mode of human brain function present when the mind is at
      rest. We report three findings that support this hypothesis. First, brain regions
      activated by actively adopting an intentional rather than nonintentional stance
      to a social stimulus were anatomically similar to those demonstrating default
      responses to fixation baseline in the same task. Second, moment-to-moment
      variation in default activity during fixation in the dorsomedial PFC was related 
      to the ease with which participants applied an intentional--but not
      nonintentional--stance to a social stimulus presented moments later. Finally,
      individuals who showed stronger dorsomedial PFC activity at baseline in a
      separate task were generally more efficient when adopting the intentional stance 
      and reported having greater social skills. These results identify a biological
      basis for the human tendency to adopt the intentional stance. More broadly, they 
      suggest that the brain's default mode of function may have evolved, in part, as a
      response to life in a social world.

TI  - Oral methylphenidate alleviates the fine motor dysfunction caused by chronic
      postnatal manganese exposure in adult rats.
PG  - 318-27
LID - 10.1093/toxsci/kfv007 [doi]
AB  - Developmental manganese (Mn) exposure is associated with motor dysfunction in
      children and animal models, but little is known about the underlying
      neurochemical mechanisms or the potential for amelioration by pharmacotherapy. We
      investigated whether methylphenidate (MPH) alleviates fine motor dysfunction due 
      to chronic postnatal Mn exposure, and whether Mn exposure impairs brain
      extracellular dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) in the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) and striatum in adult animals. Rats were orally exposed to 0 or 50 mg
      Mn/kg/day from postnatal day 1 until the end of the study (PND 145). The
      staircase test was used to assess skilled forelimb function. Oral MPH (2.5
      mg/kg/day) was administered daily 1 h before staircase testing for 16 days. DA
      and NE levels were measured by dual probe microdialysis. Results show that Mn
      exposure impaired reaching and grasping skills and the evoked release of DA and
      NE in the PFC and striatum of adult rats. Importantly, oral MPH treatment fully
      alleviated the fine motor deficits in the Mn-exposed animals, but did not affect 
      forelimb skills of control rats not exposed to Mn. These results suggest that
      catecholaminergic hypofunctioning in the PFC and striatum may underlie the
      Mn-induced fine motor dysfunction, and that oral MPH pharmacotherapy is an
      effective treatment approach for alleviating this dysfunction in adult animals.
      The therapeutic potential of MPH for the treatment of motor dysfunction in
      Mn-exposed children and adults appears promising pending further characterization
      of MPH efficacy in other functional areas (eg, attention) believed to be affected
      by developmental Mn exposure.

AB  - Knowledge of the antioxidant defense in the stress-responding structures of the
      CNS is of crucial importance, since oxidative damage is a phenomenon accompanying
      many stress-related disorders. Regulation of antioxidative and anti-inflammatory 
      defense through Nrf2 (nuclear factor 2 eritroid related factor 2) pathway has
      emerged as a promising approach for neuroprotection. In this study, we used
      chronic social isolation of male Wistar rats to induce depressive-like behavior. 
      We hypothesized that Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is compromised in the limbic brain after 
      prolonged stress. Since subcellular trafficking of Nrf2 and its inhibitor Keap1
      (Kelch ECH associating protein 1) is essential for the activation of Nrf2, we
      determined their protein level in cytosolic and nuclear compartments of
      hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). We also determined mRNA levels of
      Nrf2-regulated genes involved in the production and utilization of glutathione,
      glutamate cysteine ligase (Gclm), glutathione S-transferase (Gsta3) and
      glutathione reductase (Gsr). Our results showed that chronic isolation induced
      anxiety and depressive-like behavior, decreased Nrf2 and in parallel increased
      Keap1 and nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) in the hippocampus, which were not
      accompanied by expression profiles of Nrf2-regulated genes. Chronically stressed 
      rats challenged with acute stress failed to induce any response of examined genes
      in either of brain structures, even though Nrf2/Keap1 was altered, while in naive
      animals Nrf2 activity corresponded with an expression of Nrf2-regulated genes.
      Our results reveal maladaptive character of chronic stress at Nrf2/Keap1 level
      followed by pro-inflammatory conditions, and suggest a possible role of these
      alterations in pathogenesis of depressive/anxiety disorders.

AB  - Endocannabinoids (ECBs) such as anandamide (AEA) act by activating cannabinoid
      type 1 (CB1) or 2 (CB2) receptors. The anxiolytic effect of drugs that facilitate
      ECB effects is associated with increase in AEA levels in several encephalic
      areas, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Activation of CB1 receptors by CB1 
      agonists injected directly into these areas is usually anxiolytic. However,
      depending on the encephalic region being investigated and on the stressful
      experiences, opposite effects were observed, as reported in the ventral HIP. In
      addition, contradictory results have been reported after CB1 activation in the
      dorsal HIP (dHIP). Therefore, in the present paper we have attempted to verify if
      directly interfering with ECB metabolism/reuptake in the prelimbic (PL) portion
      of the medial PFC (MPFC) and dHIP would produce different effects in two
      conceptually distinct animal models: the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the Vogel
      conflict test (VCT). We observed that drugs which interfere with ECB
      reuptake/metabolism in both the PL and in the dentate gyrus of the dHIP induced
      anxiolytic-like effect, in both the EPM and in the VCT via CB1 receptors,
      suggesting that CB1 signaling in these brain regions modulates defensive
      responses to both innate and learned threatening stimuli. This data further
      strengthens previous results indicating modulation of hippocampal and MPFC
      activity via CB1 by ECBs, which could be therapeutically targeted to treat
      anxiety disorders.

TI  - Maternal immune activation induces changes in myelin and metabolic proteins, some
      of which can be prevented with risperidone in adolescence.
PG  - 43-55
LID - 10.1159/000368305 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal infection is a risk factor for schizophrenia but the
      molecular and cellular mechanisms are not fully known. Myelin abnormalities are
      amongst the most robust neuropathological changes observed in schizophrenia, and 
      preliminary evidence suggests that prenatal inflammation may play a role.
      METHODS: Label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed on the 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) of adult rat offspring born to dams that were exposed on 
      gestational day 15 to the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C),
      4 mg/kg] or saline and treated with the atypical antipsychotic drug risperidone
      (0.045 mg/kg) or saline in adolescence. Western blotting was employed to validate
      protein changes. RESULTS: Over 1,000 proteins were quantified in the PFC with
      pathway analyses implicating changes in core metabolic pathways, following
      prenatal poly(I:C) exposure. Some of these protein changes were absent in the PFC
      of poly(I:C)-treated offspring that subsequently received risperidone treatment
      in adolescence. Particularly interesting reductions in the expression of the
      myelin-related proteins myelin basic protein isoform 3 (MBP1) and rhombex 29 were
      observed, which were reversed by risperidone treatment. Validation by Western
      blotting confirmed changes in MBP1 and mitogen-activated kinase 1 (MAPK1).
      Western blotting was extended to assess the MAPK signalling proteins due to their
      roles in inflammation, namely phosphorylated MAPK1 and phosphorylated
      MAPK-activated protein kinase 2. Both were upregulated by poly(I:C) treatment and
      reversed by risperidone treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data suggest that
      maternal inflammation may contribute to an increased risk for schizophrenia
      through mechanisms involving metabolic function and myelin formation and that
      risperidone in adolescence may prevent or reverse such changes.

AB  - Dysfunctions in the GABAergic system are considered a core feature of
      schizophrenia. Pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors (NMDAR), or their
      genetic ablation in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons can induce
      schizophrenia-like behavior in animals. NMDAR-mediated currents shape the
      maturation of GABAergic interneurons during a critical period of development,
      making transient blockade of NMDARs during this period an attractive model for
      the developmental changes that occur in the course of schizophrenia's
      pathophysiology. Here, we examined whether developmental administration of the
      non-competitive NMDAR antagonist ketamine results in persistent deficits in
      PFC-dependent behaviors in adult animals. Mice received injections of ketamine
      (30mg/kg) on postnatal days (PND) 7, 9 and 11, and then tested on a battery of
      behavioral experiments aimed to mimic major symptoms of schizophrenia in
      adulthood (between PND 90 and 120). Ketamine treatment reduced the number of
      cells that expressed PV in the PFC by approximately 60% as previously described. 
      Ketamine affected performance in an attentional set-shifting task, impairing the 
      ability of the animals to perform an extradimensional shift to acquire a new
      strategy. Ketamine-treated animals showed deficits in latent inhibition,
      novel-object recognition and social novelty detection compared to their
      SAL-treated littermates. These deficits were not a result of generalized anxiety,
      as both groups performed comparably on an elevated plus maze. Ketamine treatment 
      did not cause changes in amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion that are often taken
      as measures for the positive-like symptoms of the disorder. Thus, ketamine
      administration during development appears to be a useful model for inducing
      cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

TI  - Functional near infrared spectroscopy as a potential biological assessment of
      addiction recovery: preliminary findings.
PG  - 119-26
LID - 10.3109/00952990.2014.983273 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Addiction science has primarily utilized self-report, continued
      substance use, and relapse factors to explore the process of recovery. However,
      the entry into successful abstinence substantially reduces our assessment
      abilities. Advances in neuroscience may be the key to objective understanding,
      treating, and monitoring long-term success in addiction recovery. OBJECTIVES: To 
      explore functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIR) as a viable technique in the
      assessment of addiction-cue reactivity. Specifically, prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      activation to alcohol cues was explored among formally alcohol-dependent
      individuals, across varying levels of successful abstinence. The aim of the
      investigation was to identify patterns of PFC activation change consistent with
      duration of abstinence. METHODS: A total of 15 formally alcohol-dependent
      individuals, with abstinence durations ranging from 1 month to 10 years, viewed
      alcohol images during fNIR PFC assessment. Participants also subjectively rated
      the same images for affect and arousal level. RESULTS: Subjective ratings of
      alcohol cues did not significantly correlate with duration of abstinence. As
      expected, days of abstinence did not significantly correlate with neutral cue
      fNIR reactivity. However, for alcohol cues, fNIR results showed increased days of
      abstinence was associated with decreased activation within the dorsolateral and
      dorsomedial prefrontal cortex regions. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest
      that fNIR may be a viable tool in the assessment of addiction-cue reactivity.
      RESULTS also support previous findings on the importance of dorsolateral and
      dorsomedial PFC in alcohol-cue activation. The findings build upon these past
      results suggesting that fNIR-assessed activation may represent a robust
      biological marker of successful addiction recovery.

AB  - Clinical studies have revealed that genetic variations in metabotropic glutamate 
      receptor 3 (mGlu3) affect performance on cognitive tasks dependent upon the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) and may be linked to psychiatric conditions such as
      schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and addiction. We have performed a series of
      studies aimed at understanding how mGlu3 influences PFC function and cognitive
      behaviors. In the present study, we found that activation of mGlu3 can induce
      long-term depression in the mouse medial PFC (mPFC) in vitro. Furthermore, in
      vivo administration of a selective mGlu3 negative allosteric modulator impaired
      learning in the mPFC-dependent fear extinction task. The results of these studies
      implicate mGlu3 as a major regulator of PFC function and cognition. Additionally,
      potentiators of mGlu3 may be useful in alleviating prefrontal impairments
      associated with several CNS disorders.

TI  - Moderate-level prenatal alcohol exposure induces sex differences in dopamine d1
      receptor binding in adult rhesus monkeys.
PG  - 2934-43
LID - 10.1111/acer.12575 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and/or 
      prenatal stress exposure on (D1 R) binding in a non human primate model. The
      dopamine D1 R is involved in executive function, and it may play a role in
      cognitive behavioral deficits associated with prenatal alcohol and/or stress
      exposure. Little is known, however, about the effects of prenatal alcohol and/or 
      stress exposure on the D1 R. We expected that prenatal insults would lead to
      alterations in D1 R binding in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum in adulthood.
      METHODS: Rhesus macaque females were randomly assigned to moderate alcohol
      exposure and/or mild prenatal stress as well as a control condition during
      pregnancy. Thirty-eight offspring were raised identically and studied as adults
      by noninvasive in vivo neuroimaging using positron emission tomography with the
      D1 antagonist radiotracer [(11) C]SCH 23390. Radiotracer binding in PFC and
      striatum was evaluated by 2 (alcohol) x 2 (stress) x 2 (sex) analysis of
      variance. RESULTS: In PFC, a significant alcohol x sex interaction was observed
      with prenatal alcohol exposure leading to increased [(11) C]SCH 23390 binding in 
      male monkeys. No main effect of prenatal alcohol or prenatal stress exposure was 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure
      results in long-term increases in prefrontal dopamine D1 R binding in males. This
      may help explain gender differences in the prevalence of neurodevelopmental
      disorders consequent to prenatal alcohol exposure.

      expression of neuregulin-1 and ErbB4 receptors in the rat brain.

AB  - Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and ErbB4 genes have been identified as candidate genes for
      schizophrenia. Post-mortem studies indicated that NRG1-ErbB4 signalling is
      impaired in schizophrenia subjects. This study investigated whether short- or
      long-term antipsychotic treatment has different effects on the expression of NRG1
      and ErbB4 receptors. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated orally with either
      aripiprazole (0.75 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg), olanzapine (0.5 mg/kg), or
      vehicle, 3 times/day for 1 or 12 weeks. Western blotting was performed to examine
      the expression of NRG1 isoforms (135 kDa, 70 kDa and 40 kDa) and ErbB4 receptors.
      Both 1-week haloperidol and olanzapine treatment increased NRG1-70kDa expression 
      in the hippocampus; haloperidol also up-regulated ErbB4 levels in the prefrontal 
      cortex (PFC). In the 12-week group, aripiprazole decreased the expression of all 
      three NRG1 isoforms and ErbB4 receptors in the PFC, NRG1-70 kDa and -40 kDa in
      the cingulate cortex (Cg), and NRG1-135 kDa, -70 kDa and ErbB4 receptors in the
      hippocampus; haloperidol reduced NRG1-135 kDa in the PFC, NRG1-40 kDa in all
      three brain regions, and ErbB4 receptor levels in the PFC and hippocampus;
      NRG1-40 kDa in the PFC and Cg was also down-regulated by olanzapine. These
      results suggest that the time-dependent and region-specific effects of
      antipsychotics on NRG1-ErbB4 signalling may contribute to the efficacy of
      antipsychotics to treat schizophrenia.

TI  - Presymptomatic glutamate levels in prefrontal cortex in the Hdh(CAG150) mouse
      model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 387-99
LID - 10.3233/JHD-140114 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder
      with few available treatments. Clinical observations suggest prefrontal
      dysfunction in early stages of HD is associated with altered glutamate transport.
      Evidence from the R6/2 mouse model suggests an abnormal increase in glutamate
      signaling in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum. OBJECTIVE: The present study
      was designed to determine if a similar deficit in glutamate function occurs in
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Hdh(CAG150) mice. METHODS: We used the following
      groups of 40 week old male and female Hdh(CAG150) mice: homozygote n = 7,
      heterozygote n = 7, wild type n = 6. Motor coordination was evaluated using a
      hanging wire grid test and a balance beam. Microdialysis measurements were taken 
      from the PFC of freely moving mice while glutamate transporters were inhibited by
      L-trans-pyrrolidine-2, 4-dicarboxylate (PDC) and compared to baseline glutamate
      levels. RESULTS: RESULTS indicated an elevation in glutamate levels in response
      to PDC but no significant difference among genotype groups. When comparing wild
      type and homozygote alone, a significant difference in total extracellular
      glutamate was observed. Contrary to our original hypothesis, the homozygote group
      had lower glutamate levels compared to their wild type counterparts. Furthermore,
      there was a significant difference in GABA measurements across genotypes.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a mechanistic dichotomy between R6/2 and
      Hdh(CAG150) mice and underscores the need to select the appropriate HD mouse
      model when assessing therapeutic interventions. In particular, the time when
      animals are evaluated can have a significant impact on behavioral and
      physiological measures and so should be carefully considered.

TI  - Psychostimulants and atomoxetine alter the electrophysiological activity of
      prefrontal cortex neurons, interaction with catecholamine and glutamate NMDA
      receptors.
PG  - 2191-205

AB  - RATIONALE: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most frequently
      diagnosed neuropsychiatric disorder in childhood. Currently available ADHD drugs 
      include the psychostimulants methylphenidate (MPH) and D-amphetamine (D-AMP),
      acting on norepinephrine and dopamine transporters/release, and atomoxetine
      (ATX), a selective norepinephrine uptake inhibitor. Recent evidence suggests an
      involvement of glutamate neurotransmission in the pathology and treatment of
      ADHD, via mechanisms to be clarified. OBJECTIVE: We have investigated how ADHD
      drugs could modulate, through interaction with catecholamine receptors, basal and
      glutamate-induced excitability of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC), a region which plays a major role in control of attention and impulsivity.
      METHODS: We have used the technique of extracellular single-unit recording in
      anaesthetised rats coupled with microiontophoresis. RESULTS: Both MPH (1-3 mg/kg)
      and D-AMP (1-9 mg/kg) increased the firing activity of PFC neurons in a dopamine 
      D1 receptor-dependent manner. ATX administration (1-6 mg/kg) also increased the
      firing of neurons, but this effect is not significantly reversed by D1 (SCH
      23390) or alpha1 (prazosin) receptor antagonists but potentiated by alpha2
      antagonist (yohimbine). All drugs induced a clear potentiation of the excitatory 
      response of PFC neurons to the microiontophoretic application of the glutamate
      agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), but not to the glutamate agonist
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA). The potentiating
      effect of D-AMP on NMDA-induced activation of PFC neurons was partially reversed 
      or prevented by dopamine D1 receptor blockade. CONCLUSION: Our data shows that
      increase in excitability of PFC neurons in basal conditions and via NMDA receptor
      activation may be involved in the therapeutic response to ADHD drugs.

      following methamphetamine sensitization.
PG  - 2083-95
LID - 10.1007/s00213-014-3840-7 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Repeated methamphetamine (MA) use leads to increases in the incentive 
      motivational properties of the drug as well as cognitive impairments. These
      behavioral alterations persist for some time following abstinence, and
      neuroadaptations in the structure and function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are
      particularly important for their expression. However, there is a weak
      understanding of the changes in neural firing and oscillatory activity in the PFC
      evoked by repeated drug use, thus complicating the development of novel treatment
      strategies for addiction. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the current study was to
      assess changes in cognitive and brain function following MA sensitization.
      METHODS: Sensitization was induced in rats, then temporal and recognition memory 
      were assessed after 1 or 30 days of abstinence. Electrophysiological recordings
      from the medial PFC were also acquired from rats whereupon simultaneous measures 
      of oscillatory and spiking activity were examined. RESULTS: Impaired temporal
      memory was observed after 1 and 30 days of abstinence. However, recognition
      memory was only impaired after 1 day of abstinence. An injection of MA profoundly
      decreased neuronal firing rate and the anesthesia-induced slow oscillation (SO)
      in both sensitized (SENS) and control (CTRL) rats. Strong correlations were
      observed between the SO and gamma band power, which was altered in SENS animals. 
      A decrease in the number of neurons phase-locked to the gamma oscillation was
      also observed in SENS animals. CONCLUSIONS: The changes observed in PFC function 
      may play an integral role in the expression of the altered behavioral phenotype
      evoked by MA sensitization.

AB  - Magnetic stimulation of the nervous system, e.g. transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS), has been used both to unravel basic structure and function of 
      the nervous system as well as to treat neurological diseases, i.e. clinical
      depression. Despite progress in both areas, ongoing advancements have been
      limited by a lack of understanding of the mechanism by which magnetic stimulation
      alters neural activity. Here, we report responses of cortical neurons to magnetic
      stimulation arising from a sub-millimeter coil. Cell attached patch clamp was
      used to record neural activity of layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) in the in vitro mouse brain slice preparation. The fields arising
      from the small coil were quite different from those arising during clinical TMS
      but nevertheless allowed the responses of cortical neurons to magnetic
      stimulation to be probed. For example, the focal nature of induced fields allowed
      the sensitivity of different regions within targeted pyramidal neurons, e.g.
      apical dendrite, soma and axon hillock, to be compared. We found that PFC
      pyramidal neurons were not sensitive to single pulses of stimulation regardless
      of coil location. However, regions of the apical dendrite and proximal axon were 
      both sensitive to repetitive stimulation as long as the orientation of the
      induced electric field was aligned with the long axis of the neuron. These
      results suggest that neurons of the PFC are sensitive to weak magnetic fields and
      further, that this type of approach may be useful for unraveling some of the
      mechanisms underlying TMS.

TI  - Dodecafluoropentane (DDFPe) and decompression sickness-related mortality in rats.
PG  - 21-6
LID - 10.3357/AMHP.4068.2015 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Perfluorocarbon (PFC) formulations can be a useful adjunct
      treatment for decompression sickness (DCS) when staged decompression procedures
      cannot be followed due to time constraints or lack of equipment. The benefit of
      PFC treatment is believed to result from its ability to transport more dissolved 
      gas than can be transported by blood alone. Dodecylfluoropentane (DDFPe) is a
      unique nanodroplet compound that expands into a gaseous state when exposed to
      physiological temperatures, resulting in a higher dissolved gas-carrying capacity
      than standard PFC formulations. METHODS: We investigated the efficacy of DDFPe in
      reducing morbidity and mortality in a rat model of severe DCS. Male
      Sprague-Dawley rats (250-280 g) were compressed to 210 fsw for 60 min before
      rapid decompression. Animals were immediately injected with 2% DDFPe (0.07 ml .
      kg(-1), 0.5 ml . kg(-1), 1.0 ml . kg(-1)) or saline, and were transferred to a
      100% O2 environment for 30 min. RESULTS: Of the animals in the saline group, 47% 
      (18/38) did not survive the decompression event, while ~98% (46/47) of the
      animals in the DDFPe group did not survive. Of the animals that died during the
      observation period, the saline group survived on average 89% longer than DDFPe
      treated animals. Seizures occurred in 42% of the DDFPe group vs. 16% in the
      saline group. Histological analysis revealed the presence of large, multifocal
      gas emboli in the liver and heart of DDFPe treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: We
      conclude that DDFPe is not an effective nonrecompressive treatment for DCS in
      rodents. Sheppard RL, Regis DP, Mahon RT. Dodecafluoropentane (DDFPe) and

AB  - The animal and blood-injection-injury (BII) subtypes of specific phobia are both 
      characterized by subjective fear but distinct autonomic reactions to threat.
      Previous functional neuroimaging studies have related these characteristic
      responses to shared and non-shared neural underpinnings. However, no comparative 
      structural data are available. This study aims to fill this gap by comparing the 
      two subtypes and also comparing them with a non-phobic control group. Gray and
      white matter data of 33 snake phobia subjects (SP), 26 dental phobia subjects
      (DP), and 37 healthy control (HC) subjects were analyzed with voxel-based
      morphometry. Especially DP differed from HC and SP by showing significantly
      increased grey matter volumes in widespread areas including the right subgenual
      anterior cingulate gyrus, left insula, left orbitofrontal and left prefrontal
      (PFC) cortices. In addition, white matter volume was significantly increased in
      the left PFC in DP compared with SP. These results are in line with functional
      changes observed in dental phobia and point toward those brain circuits
      associated with emotional processing and regulation. Future studies should aim to
      further delineate functional and structural connectivity alterations in specific 
      phobia.

TI  - Prefrontal cortical GABA modulation of spatial reference and working memory.
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyu013 [doi]
LID - pyu013 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysfunction in prefrontal cortex (PFC) GABA transmission has been
      proposed to contribute to cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia, yet how this
      system regulates different cognitive and mnemonic functions remains unclear.
      METHODS: We assessed the effects of pharmacological reduction of GABAA signaling 
      in the medial PFC of rats on spatial reference/working memory using different
      versions of the radial-arm maze task. We used a massed-trials procedure to probe 
      how PFC GABA regulates susceptibility to proactive interference. Male rats were
      well-trained to retrieve food from the same 4 arms of an 8-arm maze, receiving 5 
      trials/day (1-2 min intervals). RESULTS: Infusions of the GABAA receptor
      antagonist bicuculline (12.5-50 ng) markedly increased working and reference
      memory errors and response latencies. Similar treatments also impaired short-term
      memory on an 8-baited arm task. These effects did not appear to be due to
      increased susceptibility to proactive interference. In contrast, PFC inactivation
      via infusion of GABA agonists baclofen/muscimol did not affect reference/working 
      memory. In comparison to the pronounced effects on the 8-arm maze tasks, PFC
      GABAA antagonism only causes a slight and transient decrease in accuracy on a
      2-arm spatial discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that
      prefrontal GABA hypofunction severely disrupts spatial reference and short-term
      memory and that disinhibition of the PFC can, in some instances, perturb memory
      processes not normally dependent on the frontal lobes. Moreover, these
      impairments closely resemble those observed in schizophrenic patients, suggesting
      that perturbation in PFC GABA signaling may contribute to these types of
      cognitive deficits associated with the disorder.

AB  - Neuroimaging research has shown that acute bouts of moderate intensity aerobic
      exercise can enhance attention-based neuronal activity in frontal brain regions, 
      namely in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as improve cognitive performance. 
      The circuitry of the PFC is complex with extensive reciprocal corticocortical and
      thalamocortical connections, yet it remains unclear if aerobic exercise can also 
      assist attentional control over modality-specific sensory cortices. To test this,
      we used a tactile discrimination task to compare tactile event-related potentials
      (ERPs) prior to and following an acute bout of moderate intensity aerobic
      exercise. We hypothesized that exercise preceding performance of the task would
      result in more efficient sensory gating of irrelevant/non-attended and
      enhancement of relevant/attended sensory information, respectively. Participants 
      received vibrotactile stimulation to the second and fifth digit on the left hand 
      and reported target stimuli on one digit only. ERP amplitudes for the P50, P100, 
      N140 and long latency positivity (LLP) were quantified for attended and
      non-attended trials at FC4, C4, CP4 and P4 while P300 amplitudes were quantified 
      in response to attended target stimuli at electrodes FCZ, CZ and CPZ. Results
      showed no effect of attention on the P50, however, both P100 and LLP amplitudes
      were significantly greater during attended, task-relevant trials, while the N140 
      was enhanced for non-attended, task-irrelevant stimuli. Moreover, unattended N140
      amplitudes over parietal sites contralateral to stimulation were significantly
      greater post-exercise versus pre-exercise, while LLP modulation varied with
      greater unattended amplitudes post-exercise over frontal sites and greater
      attended amplitudes post-exercise over parietal sites. These results suggest that
      a single session of moderate intensity aerobic exercise facilitated the sensory
      gating of task-irrelevant tactile stimuli so that relevant sensory signals could 
      be enhanced at later stages of somatosensory processing in healthy young adults.

AB  - 14-3-3 is a family of conserved regulatory proteins that bind to a multitude of
      functionally diverse signalling proteins. Various genetic studies and gene
      expression and proteomic analyses have involved 14-3-3 proteins in schizophrenia 
      (SZ). On the other hand, studies about the status of these proteins in major
      depressive disorder (MD) are still missing. Immunoreactivity values of cytosolic 
      14-3-3beta and 14-3-3zeta proteins were evaluated by Western blot in prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) of subjects with schizophrenia (SZ; n=22), subjects with major
      depressive disorder (MD; n=21) and age-, gender- and postmortem delay-matched
      control subjects (n=52). The modulation of 14-3-3beta and 14-3-3zeta proteins by 
      psychotropic medication was also assessed. The analysis of both proteins in SZ
      subjects with respect to matched control subjects showed increased 14-3-3beta
      (Delta=33+/-10%, p<0.05) and 14-3-3zeta (Delta=29+/-6%, p<0.05) immunoreactivity 
      in antipsychotic-free but not in antipsychotic-treated SZ subjects.
      Immunoreactivity values of 14-3-3beta and 14-3-3zeta were not altered in MD
      subjects. These results show the specific up-regulation of 14-3-3beta and
      14-3-3zeta proteins in PFC of SZ subjects and suggest a possible down-regulation 
      of both proteins by antipsychotic treatment.

TI  - Positron emission tomography quantification of serotonin(1A) receptor binding in 
      suicide attempters with major depressive disorder.
PG  - 169-78

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Serotonergic system dysfunction has been associated with increased
      lethal suicide attempts and suicide. Dysfunction includes higher binding of
      serotonin(1A) autoreceptor in the brainstem raphe of individuals who die by
      suicide. OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationships between brain serotonin(1A)
      binding and suicidal behavior in vivo in major depressive disorder (MDD) using
      positron emission tomography and the serotonin(1A) antagonist radiotracer carbon 
      C 11 [11C]-labeled WAY-100635. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional
      positron emission tomography study at an academic medical center from 1999
      through 2009. We compared serotonin(1A) binding between individuals with MDD who 
      did not attempt suicide (nonattempters) (n = 62) and those who attempted suicide 
      (attempters) (n = 29). We subdivided the attempters into those with lower (n =
      16) and higher (n = 13) levels of lethality. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The
      binding potential (BPF) of [11C]WAY-100635 (calculated as the number of receptors
      available divided by affinity) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and brainstem,
      estimated by kinetic modeling with an arterial input function; the severity of
      suicidal behaviors, including lethality and intent of suicide attempts; and
      suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Using a linear mixed-effects model, we found no
      difference between attempters and nonattempters with MDD in serotonin(1A) BPF in 
      the PFC regions (F1,88 = 0.03; P = .87) or in the raphe nuclei (F1,88 = 0.29; P =
      .59). Raphe nuclei serotonin(1A) BPF was 45.1% greater in higher-lethality
      attempters compared with lower-lethality attempters (F1,25 = 7.33; P = .01),
      whereas no difference was observed in the PFC regions (F1,25 = 0.12; P = .73).
      Serotonin(1A )BPF in the raphe nuclei of suicide attempters was positively
      correlated with the lethality rating (F1,25 = 10.56; P = .003) and the subjective
      lethal intent factor (F1,25 = 10.63; P = .003; R2 = 0.32) based on the most
      recent suicide attempt. Suicide ideation in participants with MDD was positively 
      correlated with serotonin(1A) BPF in the PFC regions (F1,88 = 5.19; P = .03) and 
      in the raphe nuclei (F1,87 = 7.38; P = .008; R2 = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS AND
      RELEVANCE: Higher brainstem raphe serotonin(1A)BPF observed in higher-lethality
      suicide attempters with MDD is in agreement with findings in suicide studies and 
      also with the finding of low cerebrospinal fluid levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic 
      acid in higher-lethality suicide attempters. Higher brainstem raphe serotonin(1A)
      BPF would be consistent with lower levels of serotonin neuron firing and release 
      and supports a model of impaired serotonin signaling in suicide and
      higher-lethality suicidal behavior. Severity of suicidal ideation in MDD is
      related to brainstem and prefrontal serotonin(1A) BPF, suggesting a role for both
      regions in suicidal ideation. Lower levels of serotonin release at key brain
      projection sites, such as the prefrontal regions, may favor more severe suicidal 
      ideation and higher-lethality suicide attempts.

TI  - Cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization is associated with changes in the
      expression of endocannabinoid and glutamatergic signaling systems in the mouse
      prefrontal cortex.
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyu024 [doi]
LID - pyu024 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endocannabinoids modulate the glutamatergic excitatory transmission
      by acting as retrograde messengers. A growing body of studies has reported that
      both signaling systems in the mesocorticolimbic neural circuitry are involved in 
      the neurobiological mechanisms underlying drug addiction. METHODS: We
      investigated whether the expression of both endocannabinoid and glutamatergic
      systems in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were altered by an acute and/or repeated
      cocaine administration schedule that resulted in behavioral sensitization. We
      measured the protein and mRNA expression of the main endocannabinoid metabolic
      enzymes and the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). We also analyzed the mRNA
      expression of relevant components of the glutamate-signaling system, including
      glutamate-synthesizing enzymes, metabotropic receptors, and ionotropic receptors.
      RESULTS: Although acute cocaine (10 mg/kg) produced no significant changes in the
      endocannabinoid-related proteins, repeated cocaine administration (20 mg/kg
      daily) induced a pronounced increase in the CB1 receptor expression. In addition,
      acute cocaine administration (10 mg/kg) in cocaine-sensitized mice (referred to
      as cocaine priming) induced a selective increase in the endocannabinoid-degrading
      enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL).
      These protein changes were accompanied by an overall decrease in the ratios of
      endocannabinoid synthesis/degradation, especially the N-acyl
      phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D/FAAH and diacylglycerol lipase
      alpha/MAGL ratios. Regarding mRNA expression, while acute cocaine administration 
      produced a decrease in CB1 receptors and N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine
      phospholipase D, repeated cocaine treatment enhanced CB1 receptor expression.
      Cocaine-sensitized mice that were administered priming injections of cocaine
      mainly displayed an increased FAAH expression. These endocannabinoid changes were
      associated with modifications in glutamatergic transmission-related genes. An
      overall decrease was observed in the mRNA expression of the
      glutamate-synthesizing gene kidney-type glutaminase (KGA), the metabotropic
      glutamate receptors (mGluR3 and GluR), and subunits of NMDA ionotropic receptors 
      (NR1, NR2A, NR2B and NR2C) after acute cocaine administration, while mice
      repeatedly exposed to cocaine only displayed an increase in NR2C. However, in
      cocaine-sensitized mice primed with cocaine, this inhibition was reversed and a
      strong increase was detected in the mGluR5, NR2 subunits, and both GluR1 and
      GluR3. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that cocaine sensitization is
      associated with an endocannabinoid downregulation and a hyperglutamatergic state 
      in the PFC that, overall, contribute to an enhanced glutamatergic input into
      PFC-projecting areas.

TI  - Common and unique representations in pFC for face and place attractiveness.
PG  - 959-73
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00777 [doi]
AB  - Although previous neuroimaging research has identified overlapping correlates of 
      subjective value across different reward types in the ventromedial pFC (vmPFC),
      it is not clear whether this "common currency" evaluative signal extends to the
      aesthetic domain. To examine this issue, we scanned human participants with fMRI 
      while they made attractiveness judgments of faces and places-two stimulus
      categories that are associated with different underlying rewards, have very
      different visual properties, and are rarely compared with each other. We found
      overlapping signals for face and place attractiveness in the vmPFC, consistent
      with the idea that this region codes a signal for value that applies across
      disparate reward types and across both economic and aesthetic judgments. However,
      we also identified a subregion of vmPFC within which activity patterns for face
      and place attractiveness were distinguishable, suggesting that some
      category-specific attractiveness information is retained in this region. Finally,
      we observed two separate functional regions in lateral OFC: one region that
      exhibited a category-unique response to face attractiveness and another region
      that responded strongly to faces but was insensitive to their value. Our results 
      suggest that vmPFC supports a common mechanism for reward evaluation while also
      retaining a degree of category-specific information, whereas lateral OFC may be
      involved in basic reward processing that is specific to only some stimulus
      categories.

AB  - In rodent studies, elevated cholinergic neurotransmission in right prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) is essential for maintaining attentional performance, especially in 
      challenging conditions. Apparently paralleling the rises in acetylcholine seen in
      rodent studies, fMRI studies in humans reveal right PFC activation at or near
      Brodmann's areas 9 (BA 9) increases in response to elevated attentional demand.
      In the present study, we leveraged human genetic variability in the cholinergic
      system to test the hypothesis that the cholinergic system contributes to the BA 9
      response to attentional demand. Specifically, we scanned (BOLD fMRI) participants
      with a polymorphism of the choline transporter gene that is thought to limit
      choline transport capacity (Ile89Val variant of the choline transporter gene
      SLC5A7, rs1013940) and matched controls while they completed a task previously
      used to demonstrate demand-related increases in right PFC cholinergic
      transmission in rats and right PFC activation in humans. As hypothesized, we
      found that although controls showed the typical pattern of robust BA 9 responses 
      to increased attentional demand, Ile89Val participants did not. Further, pattern 
      analysis of activation within this region significantly predicted participant
      genotype. Additional exploratory pattern classification analyses suggested that
      Ile89Val participants differentially recruited orbitofrontal cortex and
      parahippocampal gyrus to maintain attentional performance to the level of
      controls. These results contribute to a growing body of translational research
      clarifying the role of cholinergic signaling in human attention and functional
      neural measures, and begin to outline the risk and resiliency factors associated 
      with potentially suboptimal cholinergic function with implications for disorders 
      characterized by cholinergic dysregulation.

AB  - The gene Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) has been indicated as a determinant
      of psychopathology, including affective disorders, and shown to influence
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus functioning, regions of major interest
      for affective disorders. We aimed to investigate whether DISC1 differentially
      modulates brain function during executive and memory processing, and morphology
      in regions relevant for depression and anxiety disorders (affective disorders).
      128 participants, with (n = 103) and without (controls; n = 25) affective
      disorders underwent genotyping for Ser704Cys (with Cys-allele considered as
      risk-allele) and structural and functional (f) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
      during visuospatial planning and emotional episodic memory tasks. For both
      voxel-based morphometry and fMRI analyses, we investigated the effect of genotype
      in controls and explored genotypeXdiagnosis interactions. Results are reported at
      p < 0.05 FWE small volume corrected. In controls, Cys-carriers showed smaller
      bilateral (para)hippocampal volumes compared with Ser-homozygotes, and lower
      activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral PFC during
      visuospatial planning. In anxiety patients, Cys-carriers showed larger
      (para)hippocampal volumes and more ACC activation during visuospatial planning.
      In depressive patients, no effect of genotype was observed and overall, no effect
      of genotype on episodic memory processing was detected. We demonstrated that
      Ser704Cys-genotype influences (para)hippocampal structure and functioning the
      dorsal PFC during executive planning, most prominently in unaffected controls.
      Results suggest that presence of psychopathology moderates Ser704Cys effects.

TI  - Is schizophrenia a neurodegenerative disease? Evidence from age-related decline
      of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the brains of schizophrenia patients and 
      matched nonpsychiatric controls.
PG  - 38-44
LID - 10.1159/000369214 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels decline in
      the brain during senescence and are also shown to be reduced in schizophrenia
      patients. BDNF is present in both the gray and white matters of the brain. It is 
      unclear whether BDNF abnormalities in schizophrenia are specific to gray and/or
      white matter. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the age-related BDNF decline is
      abnormal and contributes to the reduced BDNF in schizophrenia. METHODS: We tested
      this hypothesis by measuring BDNF protein levels in postmortem gray and white
      matter, using the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the genu of the corpus callosum as 
      regions of interests, from 20 schizophrenia patients and 20 matched
      nonpsychiatric controls. Samples were selected across the adult lifespan--from 20
      to 80 years of age. RESULTS: PFC gray matter BDNF protein levels were
      significantly lower in older age in both nonpsychiatric comparisons and patients,
      while BDNF in white matter did not decrease significantly with age in either
      group. PFC BDNF was linearly lower from 20 to 80 years of age in nonpsychiatric
      comparisons. In schizophrenia, the age effect was similarly linear in younger
      patients but a decline did not occur in older patients. CONCLUSION: PFC BDNF does
      not follow a normative linear age effect in schizophrenia patients as they grow
      older, which may represent a 'floor effect' due to earlier decline or a survivor 
      cohort of older patient donors who are less susceptible to a
      schizophrenia-related pathological aging process.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that one's brain response to high-calorie food cues
      can predict long-term weight gain or weight loss. The neural correlates that
      predict food intake in the short term have, however, hardly been investigated.
      This study examined which brain regions' activation predicts chocolate intake
      after participants had been either exposed to real chocolate or to control
      stimuli during approximately one hour, with interruptions for fMRI measurements. 
      Further we investigated whether the variance in chocolate intake could be better 
      explained by activated brain regions than by self-reported craving. In total,
      five brain regions correlated with subsequent chocolate intake. The activation of
      two reward regions (the right caudate and the left frontopolar cortex) correlated
      positively with intake in the exposure group. The activation of two regions
      associated with cognitive control (the left dorsolateral and left
      mid-dorsolateral PFC) correlated negatively with intake in the control group.
      When the regression analysis was conducted with the exposure and the control
      group together, an additional region's activation (the right anterior PFC)
      correlated positively with chocolate intake. In all analyses, the intake variance
      explained by neural correlates was above and beyond the variance explained by
      self-reported craving. These results are in line with neuroimaging research
      showing that brain responses are a better predictor of subsequent intake than
      self-reported craving. Therefore, our findings might provide for a missing link
      by associating brain activation, previously shown to predict weight change, with 
      short-term intake.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of prenatal exposure to polybrominated diphenyl
      ethers (PBDEs) and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs) on early infant
      neurobehavior. STUDY DESIGN: In a cohort of 349 mother/infant pairs, we measured 
      maternal serum concentrations during pregnancy of PBDEs, including BDE-47 and
      other related congeners, as well as 2 common PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) 
      and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid. When the infants were 5 weeks of age, we
      measured their neurobehavior by using the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network
      Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS). RESULTS: Neither PBDE nor PFC exposures during
      gestation were associated with the 11 individual NNNS outcomes included in our
      study; however, when we used latent profile analysis to categorize infants into
      neurobehavioral profiles based on performance on the NNNS (social/easygoing, high
      arousal/difficult, or hypotonic), a 10-fold increase in prenatal PFOA
      concentrations significantly increased the odds of being categorized as hypotonic
      compared with social/easygoing (aOR 3.79; 95% CI 1.1-12.8). CONCLUSIONS: Infants 
      of mothers with greater serum concentrations of PFOA during pregnancy were more
      likely to be categorized as hypotonic. No association between PBDE concentrations
      and hypotonia was found. Additional studies should further investigate possible
      associations of prenatal PFC exposure and muscle tone in infants and children.

TI  - Incongruent reduction of serotonin transporter associated with suicide attempts
      in patients with major depressive disorder: a positron emission tomography study 
      with 4-[18F]-ADAM.
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyu065 [doi]
LID - pyu065 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Much evidence supports the role of the serotonin transporter (SERT)
      in the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of major depressive disorder (MDD) and
      suicidal behaviors. METHODS: In this study, we recruited 17 antidepressant-naive 
      patients with MDD and 17 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. SERT
      availability was measured in vivo with
      N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-[(18)F]fluorophenylthio)benzylamine (4-[(18)F]-ADAM)
      positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The 21-item Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation were used to assess the
      severity of depression and the intent of suicide ideation prior to PET imaging.
      All subjects with MDD were in a current state of depression with HDRS scores
      >==18. Subjects who attempted suicide within two weeks of the study onset were
      recruited in the depressed suicidal group (n = 8). Subjects with MDD who denied
      any prior suicide attempt were recruited into the depressed non-suicidal group (n
      = 9). RESULTS: A significant reduction of SERT availability in the midbrain,
      thalamus, and striatum was noted in the MDD group relative to the control group
      (Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.05). Moreover, this effect was more pronounced
      in the depressed suicidal group compared to the control group
      (Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.01). Relative to both the depressed non-suicidal
      and control groups, the depressed suicidal group showed an increased prefrontal
      cortex (PFC)/midbrain SERT binding ratio (Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.01).
      CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an incongruent reduction of PFC SERT binding
      relative to the midbrain might discriminate between depressed suicide attempters 
      and non-attempters in patients with MDD and may be involved in the
      pathophysiology of suicide behaviors.

TI  - Brain regions involved in moxibustion-induced analgesia in irritable bowel
      syndrome with diarrhea: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Moxibustion is one of the most commonly used therapies in acupuncture
      practice, and is demonstrated to be beneficial for patients with diarrhea from
      irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). But its mechanism remains unclear. Because
      visceral hypersensitivity in IBS patients has been documented by evaluation of
      perceived stimulations through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      studies, we focused on observing brain imaging changes in D-IBS patients during
      rectal balloon distention before and after moxibustion in order to reveal its
      possible central mechanism and further evaluate its effect. METHODS: This
      clinical trial is registered under the number: ChiCTR-TRC-10000887. Eighty D-IBS 
      patients were randomly divided into a moxibustion and sham moxibustion group
      (control group) for a 4-week treatment. Fifteen patients in moxibustion group and
      thirteen patients in control group completed two fMRI scans during a 50 and 100
      ml rectal balloon distention before and after treatment. Rectal pain were
      obtained with a scan test. Birmingham IBS Symptom Scale and IBS Quality of Life
      (QOL) Scale were used to evaluate therapeutic effect. RESULTS: After treatment,
      the decrease in Birmingham IBS Symptom Scale and IBS QOL Scale scores in
      moxibustion group was significantly greater than that of control group (P <
      0.01). The defecation urge threshold and the pain perception threshold of
      moxibustion group was also significantly higher after treatment than that of
      control group (P < 0.01). The decrease in pain score during the 100 ml rectal
      balloon distention in moxibustion group was significantly greater than that of
      control group (P < 0.05). There was no definite activated center during the 50 ml
      rectal distention in either group before treatment. After treatment, the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) was affected in moxibustion group, while the PFC and the 
      anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) were affected in control group. During the 100
      ml distention before treatment in both groups, the PFC and ACC were activated.
      After treatment, they disappeared in moxibustion group but remained in control
      group. CONCLUSIONS: Moxibustion can improve symptoms and quality of life in D-IBS
      patients. It can also decrease rectal sensitivity. The activation of PFC and ACC 
      during a 100 ml rectal distention disappeared after moxibustion treatment.

TI  - Efficacy of metal and plastic stents for transmural drainage of pancreatic fluid 
      collections: a systematic review.
PG  - 486-98
LID - 10.1111/den.12418 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Metal stents are being used more frequently for transmural
      endoscopic drainage of pancreatic fluid collections (PFC) despite lack of data.
      The present systematic review was conducted to compare the rates of treatment
      success, adverse events and recurrence between patients undergoing metal versus
      plastic stent placement for endoscopic transmural drainage of PFC. METHODS:
      MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched to identify all published manuscripts that
      evaluated metal stents for endoscopic transmural drainage of PFC. All published
      studies from the same period involving plastic stent placement for PFC drainage
      that included >50 patients were also identified. Main outcome measures were to
      compare the rates of treatment success, adverse events and recurrence between the
      metal and plastic stent cohorts. RESULTS: Seventeen studies (881 patients) met
      inclusion criteria. There was no difference in overall treatment success between 
      patients treated with plastic and metal stents (81% [95% CI, 77-84%] vs 82% [95% 
      CI, 74-88%]) for both pseudocysts (85% [95% CI, 81-89%] vs 83% [95% CI, 74-89%]) 
      and walled-off necrosis (70% [95% CI, 62-76%] vs 78% [95% CI, 50-93%]). Also,
      there was no difference in the rates of adverse events (16% [95% CI, 14-39%] vs
      23% [95% CI, 16-33%]) or recurrence (10% [95% CI, 8-13%] vs 9% [95% CI, 4-19%])
      between plastic and metal stents. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence does not support 
      routine placement of metal stents for transmural drainage of PFC. Randomized
      trials are needed to justify the use of metal stents for PFC drainage.

TI  - Right hemisphere advantage in statistical learning: evidence from a probabilistic
      sequence learning task.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Picking up statistical regularities of patterns from the environment 
      is essential for predictive and adaptive behavior. One of the most important
      challenges is to understand how statistical learning occurs and how the acquired 
      information consolidates and stabilizes in the brain. Evidence suggests that the 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) has a critical role in these processes; the division of
      labor between hemispheres, however, is less characterized. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: 
      The aim of the present study was to directly investigate the causal role of the
      right and left PFC in statistical learning and its consolidation. METHODS:
      Healthy, young adults were trained on a probabilistic sequence learning task.
      Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right or left
      dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) was applied during the training in order to modify
      learning-related cortical plasticity in the targeted brain regions by increasing 
      neural excitability. Performance was tested during and immediately after the
      stimulation, 2-h and 24-h later. RESULTS: We found that the anodal tDCS over the 
      right DLPFC led to enhanced learning performance both after the 2-h and 24-h
      retention periods, suggesting the causal role of this area in statistical
      learning. In contrast, we did not find any effect of left DLPFC stimulation on
      learning. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the role of the right
      fronto-striatal network in statistical learning and its consolidation.

AB  - Inductive reasoning is an everyday process that allows us to make sense of the
      world by creating rules from a series of instances. Consistent with accounts of
      process-based fractionations of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) along the left-right 
      axis, inductive reasoning has been reliably localized to left PFC. However, these
      results may be confounded by the task domain, which is typically verbal. Indeed, 
      some studies show that right PFC activation is seen with spatial tasks. This
      study used fMRI to examine the effects of process and domain on the brain regions
      recruited during a novel pattern discovery task. Twenty healthy young adult
      participants were asked to discover the rule underlying the presentation of a
      series of letters in varied spatial locations. The rules were either verbal
      (pertaining to a single semantic category) or spatial (geometric figures).
      Bilateral ventrolateral PFC activations were seen for the spatial domain, while
      the verbal domain showed only left ventrolateral PFC. A conjunction analysis
      revealed that the two domains recruited a common region of left ventrolateral
      PFC. The data support a central role of left PFC in inductive reasoning.
      Importantly, they also suggest that both process and domain shape the
      localization of reasoning in the brain.

TI  - Fluorine MR Imaging of Inflammation in Atherosclerotic Plaque in Vivo.
PG  - 421-9
LID - 10.1148/radiol.14141371 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To preliminarily test the hypothesis that fluorine 19 ((19)F) magnetic
      resonance (MR) imaging enables the noninvasive in vivo identification of plaque
      inflammation in a mouse model of atherosclerosis, with histologic findings as the
      reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The animal studies were approved by
      the local animal ethics committee. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsions were injected 
      intravenously in a mouse model of atherosclerosis (n = 13), after which (19)F and
      anatomic MR imaging were performed at the level of the thoracic aorta and its
      branches at 9.4 T. Four of these animals were imaged repeatedly (at 2-14 days) to
      determine the optimal detection time. Repeated-measures analysis of variance with
      a Tukey test was applied to determine if there was a significant change in (19)F 
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the plaques and liver between the time points. Six
      animals were injected with a PFC emulsion that also contained a fluorophore. As a
      control against false-positive results, wild-type mice (n = 3) were injected with
      a PFC emulsion, and atherosclerotic mice were injected with a saline solution (n 
      = 2). The animals were sacrificed after the last MR imaging examination, after
      which high-spatial-resolution ex vivo MR imaging and bright-field and
      immunofluorescent histologic examination were performed. RESULTS: (19)F MR signal
      was detected in vivo in plaques in the aortic arch and its branches. The SNR was 
      found to significantly increase up to day 6 (P < .001), and the SNR of all mice
      at this time point was 13.4 +/- 3.3. The presence of PFC and plaque in the
      excised vessels was then confirmed both through ex vivo (19)F MR imaging and
      histologic examination, while no signal was detected in the control animals.
      Immunofluorescent histologic findings confirmed the presence of PFC in plaque
      macrophages. CONCLUSION: (19)F MR imaging allows the noninvasive in vivo
      detection of inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques in a mouse model of
      atherosclerosis and opens up new avenues for both the early detection of
      vulnerable atherosclerosis and the elucidation of inflammation mechanisms in
      atherosclerosis.

AB  - In the present study we investigated the neurobiological mechanisms underlying
      expression of maternal behavior. Increased maternal behavior was experimentally
      induced by a brief 15-min separation between the mother and the pups during
      postnatal days 1 to 22. On postnatal days (PND) 12 and 22, we determined in
      experimental and control dams levels of anxiety in the elevated plus maze (EPM)
      as well as the levels of receptors for estrogens (ERalpha, ERbeta), oxytocin
      (OTR) and serotonin (5-HT1AR) in areas of the limbic system (prefrontal
      cortex-PFC, hippocampus, lateral septum-SL, medial preoptic area-MPOA, shell of
      nucleus accumbens-nAc-Sh, central-CeA and basolateral-BLA amygdala), involved in 
      the regulation of maternal behavior. Experimental dams, which showed increased
      maternal behavior towards their offspring, displayed reduced anxiety in the EPM
      on both PND12 and PND22. These behavioral differences could be attributed to
      neurochemical alterations in their brain: On both PND12 and PND22, experimental
      mothers had higher levels of ERalpha and OTRs in the PFC, hippocampus, CeA, SL,
      MPOA and nAc-Sh. The experimental manipulation-induced increase in ERbeta levels 
      was less widespread, being localized in PFC, the hippocampal CA2 area, MPOA and
      nAc-Sh. In addition, 5-HT1ARs were reduced in the PFC, hippocampus, CeA, MPOA and
      nAc-Sh of the experimental mothers. Our results show that the experience of the
      daily repeated brief separation from the pups results in increased brain ERs and 
      OTRs, as well as decreased 5-HT1ARs in the dam's brain; these neurochemical
      changes could underlie the observed increase in maternal behavior and the
      reduction of anxiety.

TI  - Protective effect of eugenol against restraint stress-induced gastrointestinal
      dysfunction: Potential use in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 968-74
LID - 10.3109/13880209.2014.950674 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Eugenol, an essential constituent found in plants such as Eugenia
      caryophyllata Thunb. (Myrtaceae) is reported to possess neuroprotective and
      anti-stress activities. These activities can potentially be useful in the
      treatment of stress-induced irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). OBJECTIVE: The
      protective effect of eugenol was assessed against restraint stress (RS)-induced
      IBS-like gastrointestinal dysfunction in rats. Further, its centrally mediated
      effect was evaluated in this model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eugenol (12.5, 25, and
      50 mg/kg), ondansetron (4.0 mg/kg, p.o.), and vehicle were administered to rats
      for 7 consecutive days before exposure to 1 h RS. One control group was not
      exposed to RS-induction. The effect of eugenol (50 mg/kg) with and without RS
      exposure was evaluated for mechanism of action and per se effect, respectively.
      The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal cortex (HPA)-axis function was evaluated by
      estimating the plasma corticosterone level. The levels of brain monoamines,
      namely serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and their metabolites were estimated 
      in stress-responsive regions such as hippocampus, hypothalamus, pre-frontal
      cortex (PFC), and amygdala. Oxidative damage and antioxidant defenses were also
      assessed in brain regions. RESULTS: Eugenol (50 mg/kg) reduced 80% of RS-induced 
      increase in fecal pellets similar to that of ondansetron. Eugenol attenuated 80% 
      of stress-induced increase in plasma corticosterone and modulated the
      serotonergic system in the PFC and amygdala. Eugenol attenuated stress-induced
      changes in norepinephrine and potentiated the antioxidant defense system in all
      brain regions. CONCLUSION: Eugenol protected against RS-induced development of
      IBS-like gastrointestinal dysfunction through modulation of HPA-axis and brain
      monoaminergic pathways apart from its antioxidant effect.

AB  - Depression is a complex, heterogeneous mental disorder. Currently available
      antidepressants are only effective in about one-third to one-half of all
      patients. The mechanisms underlying antidepressant response and treatment
      resistance are poorly understood. Recent clinical evidence implicates the
      involvement of leptin in treatment response to antidepressants. In this study, we
      determined the functional role of the leptin receptor (LepRb) in behavioral
      responses to the selective serotonergic antidepressant fluoxetine and the
      noradrenergic antidepressant desipramine. While acute and chronic treatment with 
      fluoxetine or desipramine in wild-type mice elicited antidepressant-like effects 
      in the forced swim test, mice null for LepRb (db/db) displayed resistance to
      treatment with either fluoxetine or desipramine. Fluoxetine stimulated
      phosphorylation of Akt(Thr308) and GSK-3beta(Ser9) in the hippocampus and
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) of wild-type mice but not in db/db mice. Desipramine
      failed to induce measurable changes in Akt, GSK-3beta or ERK1/2 phosphorylation
      in the hippocampus and PFC, as well as hypothalamus of either genotype of mice.
      Deletion of LepRb specifically from hippocampal and cortical neurons resulted in 
      fluoxetine insensitivity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test while
      leaving the response to desipramine intact. These results suggest that functional
      LepRb is critically involved in regulating the antidepressant-like behavioral
      effects of both fluoxetine and desipramine. The antidepressant effects of
      fluoxetine but not desipramine are dependent on the presence of functional LepRb 
      in the hippocampus and cortex.

AB  - This article focuses on the interaction between the basal ganglia (BG) and
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). The BG are a group of nuclei at the base of the
      forebrain that are highly connected with cortex. A century of research suggests
      that the role of the BG is not exclusively motor, and that the BG also play an
      important role in learning and memory. In this review article, we argue that one 
      important role of the BG is to train connections between posterior cortical areas
      and frontal cortical regions that are responsible for automatic behavior after
      extensive training. According to this view, one effect of BG trial-and-error
      learning is to activate the correct frontal areas shortly after posterior
      associative cortex activation, thus allowing for Hebbian learning of robust,
      fast, and efficient cortico-cortical processing. This hypothesized process is
      general, and the content of the learned associations depends on the specific
      areas involved (e.g., associations involving premotor areas would be more closely
      related to behavior than associations involving the PFC). We review experiments
      aimed at pinpointing the function of the BG and the frontal cortex and show that 
      these results are consistent with the view that the BG is a general purpose
      trainer for cortico-cortical connections. We conclude with a discussion of some
      implications of the integrative framework and how this can help better understand
      the role of the BG in many different tasks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore knowledge and use of female condoms in China, and to
      compare four modes of failure between the Phoenurse female condom (PFC) and the
      second-generation Femidom female condom (FC2). METHODS: In a randomized,
      crossover trial, sexually active women aged 20-49years who attended a family
      planning service in Qingdao, China, were recruited between April and October,
      2013. A computer-generated randomized sequence was used to assign participants
      (1:1) to group A (used 10 PFCs followed by 10 FC2s) or group B (used 10 FC2s
      followed by 10 PFCs). Study investigators and participants were masked to
      allocation. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline and after using the
      two types of FCs. They also kept coital logs. RESULTS: At baseline, 30 (10.3%) of
      290 participants understood female condoms, but only 1 (0.3%) had ever used one. 
      Total failure rates were 3.6% (420/11 578) and 2.3% (265/11 594) for PFC and FC2,
      respectively (P<0.001). Slippage was the most common form of failure, affecting
      6.9% of PFC uses and 5.0% of FC2 uses. Breakage, misdirection, and slippage were 
      significantly more common with the PFC than with the FC2 (P</=0.002). CONCLUSION:
      Understanding of female condoms is poor in China. Failure is more common with the
      PFC than with the FC2.

AB  - Depression is an inflammatory, commonly occurring and lethal psychiatric disorder
      having high lifetime prevalence. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that
      activation of immuno-inflammatory and oxido-nitrosative stress pathways play
      major role in the pathophysiology of depression. Honokiol (HNK) is a biphenolic
      neolignan possessing multiple biological activities including antioxidant,
      anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, antidepressant and neuroprotective. The present
      study investigated the effect of HNK (2.5 and 5 mg/kg, i.p.) pretreatment (30 min
      prior to LPS) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.83 mg/kg, i.p.) induced depressive
      like behavior, neuroinflammation, and oxido-nitrosative stress in mice. HNK
      pretreatment at both the doses significantly attenuated LPS induced
      depressive-like behavior by reducing the immobility time in forced swim and tail 
      suspension test, and by improving the anhedonic behavior observed in sucrose
      preference test. HNK pretreatment ameliorated LPS induced neuroinflammation by
      reducing IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha level in hippocampus (HC) and prefrontal
      cortex (PFC). HNK pretreatment prevented LPS evoked oxidative/nitrosative stress 
      via improving reduced glutathione level along with reduction in the lipid
      peroxidation and nitrite level in HC and PFC. Pretreatment with HNK also
      prevented the increase in plasma corticosterone (CORT) and decrease in
      hippocampal BDNF level in LPS challenged mice. In conclusion, current
      investigation suggested that HNK pretreatment provided protection against
      LPS-induced depressive like behavior which may be mediated by repression of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as oxido-nitrosative stress in HC and PFC. Our
      results strongly speculated that HNK could be a therapeutic approach for the
      treatment of depression and other pathophysiological conditions which are closely
      associated with neuroinflammation and oxido-nitrosative stress.

AB  - The levels of kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous negative modulator of alpha7
      nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7nAChRs), are elevated in the brains of
      patients with schizophrenia (SZ). We reported that increases of brain KYNA in
      rats, through dietary exposure to its precursor kynurenine from embryonic day
      (ED)15 to postnatal day (PD) 21, result in neurochemical and cognitive deficits
      in adulthood. The present experiments focused on the effects of prenatal exposure
      to elevated kynurenine on measures of prefrontal excitability known to be
      impaired in SZ. Pregnant dams were fed a mash containing kynurenine (100 mg/day; 
      progeny = EKYNs) from ED15 until ED22. Controls were fed an unadulterated mash
      (progeny = ECONs). The dietary loading procedure elevated maternal and fetal
      plasma kynurenine (2223% and 693% above controls, respectively) and increased
      fetal KYNA (forebrain; 500% above controls) on ED21. Elevations in forebrain KYNA
      disappeared after termination of the loading (PD2), but KYNA levels in the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) were unexpectedly increased again when measured in adults
      (PD56-80; 75% above controls). We also observed changes in several markers of
      prefrontal excitability, including expression of the alpha7nAChR (22% and 17%
      reductions at PD2 and PD56-80), expression of mGluR2 (31% and 24% reductions at
      ED21 and PD56-80), dendritic spine density (11-14% decrease at PD56-80),
      subsensitive mesolimbic stimulation of glutamate release in PFC, and
      reversal/extra-dimensional shift deficits in the prefrontally-mediated
      set-shifting task. These results highlight the deleterious impact of elevated
      KYNA levels during sensitive periods of early development, which model the
      pathophysiological and cognitive deficits seen in SZ.

AB  - The thalamus is a critical node for several pathways involved in learning and
      memory. Damage to the thalamus by trauma, disease or malnourishment can impact
      the effectiveness of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) and lead
      to a profound amnesia state. Using the pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency
      (PTD) rat model of human Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, we tested the hypothesis
      that co-infusion of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine across the
      PFC and HPC would recover spatial alternation performance in PTD rats. When
      cholinergic tone was increased by dual injections across the PFC-HPC, spontaneous
      alternation performance in PTD rats was recovered. In addition, we tested a
      second hypothesis that two ventral midline thalamic nuclei, the rhomboid nucleus 
      and nucleus reuniens (Rh-Re), form a critical node needed for the recovery of
      function observed when cholinergic tone was increased across the PFC and HPC. By 
      using the GABAA agonist muscimol to temporarily deactivate the Rh-Re the recovery
      of alternation behavior obtained in the PTD model by cholinergic stimulation
      across the PFC-HPC was blocked. In control pair-fed (PF) rats, inactivation of
      the Rh-Re impaired spontaneous alternation. However, when inactivation of the
      Rh-Re co-occurred with physostigmine infusions across the PFC-HPC, PF rats had
      normal performance. These results further demonstrate that the Rh-Re is critical 
      in facilitating interactions between the HPC and PFC, but other redundant
      pathways also exist.

AB  - Prenatal protein malnutrition (PPM) in rats causes enduring changes in brain and 
      behavior including increased cognitive rigidity and decreased inhibitory control.
      A preliminary gene microarray screen of PPM rat prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      identified alterations in KCNJ3 (GIRK1/Kir3.1), a gene important for regulating
      neuronal excitability. Follow-up with polymerase chain reaction and Western blot 
      showed decreased KCNJ3 expression in the PFC, but not hippocampus or brainstem.
      To verify localization of the effect to the PFC, baseline regional brain activity
      was assessed with (14)C-2-deoxyglucose. Results showed decreased activation in
      the PFC but not hippocampus. Together these findings point to the unique
      vulnerability of the PFC to the nutritional insult during early brain
      development, with enduring effects in adulthood on KCNJ3 expression and baseline 
      metabolic activity.

AB  - Cognitive reappraisal has been associated with increased activation in prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) and cingulate regions implicated in cognitive control and affect
      regulation. To date, neuroimaging studies of reappraisal have primarily used
      emotionally evocative scenes, and it remains unclear whether the same cognitive
      strategy applied to emotional facial expressions would involve similar or
      different neural underpinnings. The present study used fMRI to examine brain
      activation during cognitive reappraisal of negatively valenced facial expressions
      relative to passive viewing of negative and neutral facial expressions.
      Twenty-two healthy adults completed a cognitive reappraisal task comprised of
      three different conditions (Look-Neutral, Maintain-Negative,
      Reappraise-Negative). Results indicated that reappraisal was associated with a
      decrease in negative affect and engagement of PFC brain regions implicated in
      cognitive control and affect regulation (DLPFC, mPFC, and VLPFC). Furthermore,
      individual differences in habitual reappraisal use were associated with greater
      DLPFC and mPFC activation, while suppression use was associated with greater
      amygdala activation. The present study provides preliminary evidence that facial 
      expressions are effective alternative 'targets' of prefrontal engagement during
      cognitive reappraisal. These findings are particularly relevant for future
      research probing the neural bases of emotion regulation in populations for whom
      aversive scenes may be less appropriate (e.g., children) and illnesses in which
      aberrant responses to social signals of threat and negative feedback are cardinal
      phenotypes.

AB  - Visual categorization is an essential perceptual and cognitive process for
      assigning behavioral significance to incoming stimuli. Categorization depends on 
      sensory processing of stimulus features as well as flexible cognitive processing 
      for classifying stimuli according to the current behavioral context.
      Neurophysiological studies suggest that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the
      inferior temporal cortex (ITC) are involved in visual shape categorization.
      However, their precise roles in the perceptual and cognitive aspects of the
      categorization process are unclear, as the two areas have not been directly
      compared during changing task contexts. To address this, we examined the impact
      of task relevance on categorization-related activity in PFC and ITC by recording 
      from both areas as monkeys alternated between a shape categorization and passive 
      viewing tasks. As monkeys viewed the same stimuli in both tasks, the impact of
      task relevance on encoding in each area could be compared. While both areas
      showed task-dependent modulations of neuronal activity, the patterns of results
      differed markedly. PFC, but not ITC, neurons showed a modest increase in firing
      rates when stimuli were task relevant. PFC also showed significantly stronger
      category selectivity during the task compared with passive viewing, while
      task-dependent modulations of category selectivity in ITC were weak and occurred 
      with a long latency. Finally, both areas showed an enhancement of stimulus
      selectivity during the task compared with passive viewing. Together, this
      suggests that the ITC and PFC show differing degrees of task-dependent
      flexibility and are preferentially involved in the perceptual and cognitive
      aspects of the categorization process, respectively.

AB  - PURPOSE: To improve (19) F flip angle calibration and compensate for B1
      inhomogeneities in quantitative (19) F MRI of sparse molecular epitopes with
      perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoparticle (NP) emulsion contrast agents. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Flip angle sweep experiments on PFC-NP point source phantoms with three 
      custom-designed (19) F/(1) H dual-tuned coils revealed a difference in required
      power settings for (19) F and (1) H nuclei, which was used to calculate a
      calibration ratio specific for each coil. An image-based correction technique was
      developed using B1 -field mapping on (1) H to correct for (19) F and (1) H images
      in two phantom experiments. RESULTS: Optimized (19) F peak power differed
      significantly from that of (1) H power for each coil (P < 0.05). A ratio of (19) 
      F/(1) H power settings yielded a coil-specific and spatially independent
      calibration value (surface: 1.48 +/- 0.06; semicylindrical: 1.71 +/- 0.02,
      single-turn-solenoid: 1.92 +/- 0.03). (1) H-image-based B1 correction equalized
      the signal intensity of (19) F images for two identical (19) F PFC-NP samples
      placed in different parts of the field, which were offset significantly by ~66%
      (P < 0.001), before correction. CONCLUSION: (19) F flip angle calibration and B1 
      -mapping compensations to the (19) F images employing the more abundant (1) H
      signal as a basis for correction resulted in a significant change in the
      quantification of sparse (19) F MR signals from targeted PFC NP emulsions.

TI  - Markers of apoptosis induction and proliferation in the orbitofrontal cortex in
      alcohol dependence.
PG  - 2790-9
LID - 10.1111/acer.12559 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol-dependent (ALC) subjects exhibit glial and neuronal pathology
      in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, in many patients, neurophysiological
      disturbances are not associated with catastrophic cell depletion despite
      prolonged alcohol abuse. It is still unclear how some relevant markers of a
      cell's propensity to degenerate or proliferate are changed in the PFC of ALC
      subjects without major neurological disorders. METHODS: Levels of pro-apoptotic
      caspase 8 (C8), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), direct IAP
      binding protein with low pI (DIABLO), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), 
      and density of cells immunoreactive for proliferation marker Ki-67 (Ki-67-IR)
      were measured postmortem in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of 29 subjects
      with alcohol dependence and 23 nonpsychiatric comparison subjects. RESULTS:
      Alcohol subjects had significantly higher levels of the 14 kDa C8 fragment
      (C8-14), an indicator of C8 activation. However, there was no change in the
      levels of DIABLO, XIAP, or in the DIABLO/XIAP ratio. PCNA protein level and
      density of Ki-67-IR cells were not significantly changed in alcoholics, although 
      PCNA levels were increased in older ALC subjects as compared to controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: Significant increase of a C8 activation indicator was found in
      alcoholism, but without significant changes in XIAP level, DIABLO/XIAP ratio, or 
      Ki-67 labeling. These results would help to explain the absence of catastrophic
      cell loss in the PFC of many Brigman subjects, while still being consistent with 
      an alcoholism-related vulnerability to slow decline in glial cells and neurons in
      the OFC of alcoholics.

TI  - Effects of disrupting medial prefrontal cortex GABA transmission on
      decision-making in a rodent gambling task.
PG  - 1755-65
LID - 10.1007/s00213-014-3816-7 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Decision-making is a complex cognitive process that is mediated, in
      part, by subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC). Decision-making is
      impaired in a number of psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia. Notably, 
      people with schizophrenia exhibit reductions in GABA function in the same PFC
      areas that are implicated in decision-making. For example, expression of the
      GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD67 is reduced in the dorsolateral PFC of people with 
      schizophrenia. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this experiment was to determine whether
      disrupting cortical GABA transmission impairs decision-making using a rodent
      gambling task (rGT). METHODS: Rats were trained on the rGT until they reached
      stable performance and then were implanted with guide cannulae aimed at the
      medial PFC. Following recovery, the effects of intra-PFC infusions of the GABAA
      receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI) or the GABA synthesis inhibitor 
      L-allylglycine (LAG) on performance on the rGT were assessed. RESULTS:
      Intracortical infusions of BMI (25 ng/mul/side), but not LAG (10 mug/mul/side),
      altered decision-making. Following BMI infusions, rats made fewer advantageous
      choices. Follow-up experiments suggested that the change in decision-making was
      due to a change in the sensitivity to the punishments, rather than a change in
      the sensitivity to reward magnitudes, associated with each outcome. LAG infusions
      increased premature responding, a measure of response inhibition, but did not
      affect decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Blocking GABAA receptors, but not inhibiting
      cortical GABA synthesis, within the medial PFC affects decision-making in the
      rGT. These data provide proof-of-concept evidence that disruptions in GABA
      transmission can contribute to the decision-making deficits in schizophrenia.

      reversal by citalopram.
PG  - 1643-53
LID - 10.1007/s00213-014-3803-z [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Alterations in the serotonergic transmission and activity of
      corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family may underlie anxiety and depressive
      disorders. These could be corrected by treatment with SSRIs. OBJECTIVES: The
      objective of the current study is to determine whether the increased anxiety of
      prenatally stressed (PS) rats of both sexes is associated with changes in 5HT1A
      and CRF type 2 receptors (5HT1AR and CRFR2) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dorsal
      raphe nuclei (DRN) axis, and how these are affected by chronic treatment with
      citalopram (10 mg/kg/day). We focussed on GABAergic cells that co-express
      parvalbumin and/or neuropeptide Y, and 5HT1AR in the medial prefrontal cortex
      (mPFC) and on cells that express 5HT, parvalbumin, 5HT1AR or CRFR2 in the DRN.
      RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry with fluorescent antibodies demonstrated sex
      differences in the expression of 5HT1AR and CRFR2 protein. Prenatal stress
      selectively reduced the expression of 5HT1AR on GABAergic cells in the mPFC in
      males and that of CRFR2 in the DRN of females. Citalopram treatment for 5 weeks
      abolished the increase in anxiety in both sexes, restored the intensity of
      expression of 5HT1AR in the mPFC in males and increased their expression in the
      mPFC and DRN in females. Citalopram reduced CRFR2 expression in control and PS
      males but increased it in PS females. CONCLUSIONS: Male and female rats show
      differences in the expression of 5HT1AR and CRFR2 protein that are selectively
      reduced by prenatal stress. Reversal by citalopram of the changes in the
      expression of these receptors induced by prenatal stress support their role in
      the aetiology of anxiety.

TI  - Functional compensation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex improves
      memory-dependent decisions in older adults.
PG  - 15648-57
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2888-14.2014 [doi]
AB  - Everyday consumer choices frequently involve memory, as when we retrieve
      information about consumer products when making purchasing decisions. In this
      context, poor memory may affect decision quality, particularly in individuals
      with memory decline, such as older adults. However, age differences in choice
      behavior may be reduced if older adults can recruit additional neural resources
      that support task performance. Although such functional compensation is well
      documented in other cognitive domains, it is presently unclear whether it can
      support memory-guided decision making and, if so, which brain regions play a role
      in compensation. The current study engaged younger and older humans in a
      memory-dependent choice task in which pairs of consumer products from a popular
      online-shopping site were evaluated with different delays between the first and
      second product. Using functional imaging (fMRI), we found that the ventromedial
      prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) supports compensation as defined by three a priori
      criteria: (1) increased vmPFC activation was observed in older versus younger
      adults; (2) age-related increases in vmPFC activity were associated with
      increased retrieval demands; and (3) increased vmPFC activity was positively
      associated with performance in older adults-evidence of successful compensation. 
      Extending these results, we observed evidence for compensation in connectivity
      between vmPFC and the dorsolateral PFC during memory-dependent choice. In
      contrast, we found no evidence for age differences in value-related processing or
      age-related compensation for choices without delayed retrieval. Together, these
      results converge on the conclusion that age-related decline in memory-dependent
      choice performance can be minimized via functional compensation in vmPFC.

TI  - Rescuing prefrontal cAMP-CREB pathway reverses working memory deficits during
      withdrawal from prolonged alcohol exposure.
AB  - Both human and animal studies indicate that alcohol withdrawal following chronic 
      alcohol consumption (CAC) impairs many of the cognitive functions which rely on
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC). A candidate signaling cascade contributing to memory
      deficits during alcohol withdrawal is the protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP-responsive 
      element binding (CREB) cascade, although the role of PKA/CREB cascade in
      behavioral and molecular changes during sustained withdrawal period remains
      largely unknown. We demonstrated that 1 week (1W) or 6 weeks (6W) withdrawal
      after 6-month CAC impairs working memory (WM) in a T-maze spontaneous alternation
      task and reduces phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) in the PFC but not the dorsal CA1
      region (dCA1) of the hippocampus compared with CAC and water conditions. In
      contrast, both CAC-unimpaired and withdrawn-impaired mice exhibited decreased
      pCREB in dCA1 as well as reduced histone H4 acetylation in PFC and dCA1, compared
      with water controls. Next, we showed that enhancing CREB activity through
      rolipram administration prior to testing improved WM performance in withdrawn
      mice but impaired WM function in water mice. In addition, WM improvement
      correlates positively with increased pCREB level selectively in the PFC of
      withdrawn mice. Results further indicate that direct infusion of the PKA
      activator (Sp-cAMPS) into the PFC significantly improves or impairs,
      respectively, WM performance in withdrawn and water animals. In contrast,
      Sp-cAMPS had no effect on WM when infused into the dCA1. Collectively, these
      results provide strong support that dysregulation of PKA/CREB-dependent processes
      in prefrontal neurons is a critical molecular signature underlying cognitive
      decline during alcohol withdrawal.

TI  - Selective Medial Prefrontal Cortex Responses During Live Mutual Gaze Interactions
      in Human Infants: An fNIRS Study.
PG  - 691-701
LID - 10.1007/s10548-014-0414-2 [doi]
AB  - To investigate the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in processing multimodal
      communicative ostensive signals in infants, we measured cerebral hemodynamic
      responses by using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during the social
      interactive play "peek-a-boo", in which both visual (direct gaze) and auditory
      (infant-directed speech) stimuli were presented. The infants (mean age, around 7 
      months) sat on their mother's lap, equipped with an NIRS head cap, and looked at 
      a partner's face during "peek-a-boo". An eye-tracking system simultaneously
      monitored the infants' visual fixation patterns. The results indicate that, when 
      the partner presented a direct gaze, rather than an averted gaze, toward an
      infant during social play, the infant fixated on the partner's eye region for a
      longer duration. Furthermore, hemodynamic activity increased more prominently
      dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in response to social play with a partner's 
      direct gaze compared to an averted gaze. In contrast, hemodynamic activity
      increased in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R-lPFC) regardless of a
      partner's eye gaze direction. These results indicate that a partner's direct gaze
      shifts an infant's attention to the partner's eyes for interactive communication,
      and specifically activates the mPFC. The differences in hemodynamic responses
      between the mPFC and R-lPFC suggest functional differentiation within the PFC,
      and a specific role of the mPFC in the perception of face-to-face communication, 
      especially in mutual gaze, which is essential for social interaction.

TI  - Rapid plasticity in the prefrontal cortex during affective associative learning.
PG  - e110720
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0110720 [doi]
AB  - MultiCS conditioning is an affective associative learning paradigm, in which
      affective categories consist of many similar and complex stimuli. Comparing
      visual processing before and after learning, recent MultiCS conditioning studies 
      using time-sensitive magnetoencephalography (MEG) revealed enhanced activation of
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions towards emotionally paired versus neutral stimuli
      already during short-latency processing stages (i.e., 50 to 80 ms after stimulus 
      onset). The present study aimed at showing that this rapid differential
      activation develops as a function of the acquisition and not the extinction of
      the emotional meaning associated with affectively paired stimuli. MEG data of a
      MultiCS conditioning study were analyzed with respect to rapid changes in PFC
      activation towards aversively (electric shock) paired and unpaired faces that
      occurred during the learning of stimulus-reinforcer contingencies. Analyses
      revealed an increased PFC activation towards paired stimuli during 50 to 80 ms
      already during the acquisition of contingencies, which emerged after a single
      pairing with the electric shock. Corresponding changes in stimulus valence could 
      be observed in ratings of hedonic valence, although participants did not seem to 
      be aware of contingencies. These results suggest rapid formation and access of
      emotional stimulus meaning in the PFC as well as a great capacity for adaptive
      and highly resolving learning in the brain under challenging circumstances.

      reward memory retrieval in mice].
PG  - 545-58
AB  - The intense associative memories that develop between cocaine-paired contexts and
      rewarding stimuli make addiction hard to cure by contributing to cocaine seeking 
      and relapse. So it's of great importance to examine the neurobiological basis of 
      addiction memory. Cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) used in this study
      is a form of Pavlovian conditioning which can establish associations between drug
      and contextual factors. c-Fos and Zif268 are commonly used immediate early gene
      (IEG) makers to identify neurons that are activated after a stimulus or
      behavioral conditioning. This study was designed to reveal neuronal c-Fos, Zif268
      expression pattern in 10 brain regions following cocaine context-associated
      reward memory retrieval in mice, combining animal behavioral study and
      immunofluorescence method. C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into 3 groups:
      Saline retrieval, Cocaine retrieval, and No retrieval of cocaine groups. Cocaine 
      retrieval and No retrieval of cocaine underwent CPP training (one side paired
      with cocaine, and the other side with saline) except that No retrieval of cocaine
      group didn't undergo CPP test. Saline retrieval group received saline injections 
      (i.p) on both sides. The results showed that: Neuronal c-Fos, Zif268 protein
      expression levels in nucleus accumbens (NAc) core both were elevated in Cocaine
      retrieval group compared with those in Saline retrieval (Control) group during
      cocaine context-associated reward memory retrieval. Zif268 protein expression
      level in basolateral amygdala (BLA) was also elevated in Cocaine retrieval group 
      compared with that in control mice. Elevation was not seen in other regions such 
      as hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC). Thus, NAc core and BLA were activated
      during cocaine context-associated reward memory retrieval. The results suggest
      that neurons that are activated in NAc core and BLA are crucial basis of cocaine 
      context-associated reward memory.

TI  - Neural signatures of fairness-related normative decision making in the ultimatum 
      game: a coordinate-based meta-analysis.
PG  - 591-602
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22649 [doi]
AB  - The willingness to incur personal costs to enforce prosocial norms represents a
      hallmark of human civilization. Although recent neuroscience studies have used
      the ultimatum game to understand the neuropsychological mechanisms that underlie 
      the enforcement of fairness norms; however, a precise characterization of the
      neural systems underlying fairness-related norm enforcement remains elusive. In
      this study, we used a coordinate-based meta-analysis on functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using the ultimatum game with the goal to
      provide an additional level of evidence for the refinement of the underlying
      neural architecture of this human puzzling behavior. Our results demonstrated a
      convergence of reported activation foci in brain networks associated with
      psychological components of fairness-related normative decision making,
      presumably reflecting a reflexive and intuitive system (System 1) and a
      reflective and deliberate system (System 2). System 1 (anterior insula,
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex [PFC]) may be associated with the reflexive and
      intuitive responses to norm violations, representing a motivation to punish norm 
      violators. Those intuitive responses conflict with economic self-interest,
      encoded in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which may engage cognitive
      control from a reflective and deliberate System 2 to resolve the conflict by
      either suppressing (ventrolateral PFC, dorsomedial PFC, left dorsolateral PFC,
      and rostral ACC) the intuitive responses or over-riding self-interest (right
      dorsolateral PFC). Taken together, we suggest that fairness-related norm
      enforcement recruits an intuitive system for rapid evaluation of norm violations 
      and a deliberate system for integrating both social norms and self-interest to
      regulate the intuitive system in favor of more flexible decision making.

AB  - Impact of polysilicic acid (pSi) in polyferric silicate chloride (PFSiC) on
      coagulation-ultrafiltration process was investigated in comparison with
      polyferric chloride (PFC). The Fe(III) species distribution in PFSiC and PFC was 
      measured by a timed complexation spectroscopy method. Characteristics of flocs
      produced by PFSiC and PFC were studied using a laser diffraction particle sizing 
      device. Moreover, membrane fouling was evaluated using a dead-end batch
      ultrafiltration unit under two operation modes, coagulation-ultrafiltration
      (C-UF) and coagulation-sedimentation-ultrafiltration (CSUF). The results
      indicated that PFSiC with various Si/Fe ratios had better turbidity removal
      efficiency but inferior organic matter removal. Flocs formed by PFSiC were larger
      than those by PFC. In case of PFSiC, floc size increased with Si/Fe ratio
      increasing. PFSiC with various Si/Fe ratios resulted in more compact and weaker
      flocs than PFC. Ultrafiltration experiments indicated that under C-UF mode, PFSiC
      with Si/Fe ratios of 0.07 and 0.10 presented better membrane performance than
      PFC. Under CSUF mode, addition of pSi could alleviate membrane fouling.

AB  - The attention system functionally modulates brain activity to exert control over 
      thoughts, feelings and actions. Three distinct but mutually interacting
      components of attention have been hypothesized: alerting, which mediates the
      maintenance of a state of vigilance toward an upcoming stimulus; orienting, which
      supports the selection of sensory information, and executive control that is
      involved in detecting and resolving cognitive conflicts. The performance of tasks
      probing these components engages fronto-parietal and thalamic regions. Also,
      general attention has been associated with the activity of resting-state networks
      (RSNs), which are sets of brain regions with synchronous temporal fluctuations.
      Importantly, the association between the intrinsic brain activity of RSNs and the
      efficiency and integration of the specific attentional components remains largely
      unexplored. For this aim, we recruited twenty healthy volunteers who performed
      the Attention Network Test-Revised (ANT-R), assessing the alerting, orienting and
      executive control components as well as their interactions, and underwent
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. For each participant RSNs
      were estimated using double regression. The RSNs spanning across areas previously
      implicated in attentional processing were correlated with ANT-R scores using
      multiple regressions. Significant brain behavior correlations emerged between
      ANT-R scores and RSNs comprising the regions relevant for attentional processing,
      i.e., left and right prefronto-parietal (PFC-PC), dorsal attentional (DAN),
      salience (SN), and default mode (DMN) networks. The activity of PFC-PC networks
      was correlated with alerting in parietal and frontal regions, and with location
      conflict in the frontal regions. The DAN connectivity was correlated with
      flanker, location conflict, and their interaction in parietal regions. SN was
      associated with flanker by location and flanker by orienting interactions in the 
      inferior frontal regions. Finally, the activity of the DMN was associated with
      flanker conflict in midline structures such as precuneus and anterior cingulate
      cortex and also in right angular gyrus. These results suggest that the brain is
      endowed with an intrinsic functional organization to support attention, not only 
      in its global function, but also in its distinct components.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is widely held that single cells in anterior cingulate and lateral
      prefrontal cortex (ACC/PFC) coordinate their activity during attentional
      processes, although cellular activity that may underlie such coordination across 
      ACC/PFC has not been identified. We thus recorded cells in five ACC/PFC subfields
      of macaques engaged in a selective attention task, characterized those spiking
      events that indexed attention, and identified how spiking of distinct cell
      populations synchronized between brain areas. RESULTS: We found that cells in
      ACC/PFC increased the firing of brief 200 Hz spike bursts when subjects shifted
      attention and engaged in selective visual processing. In contrast to nonburst
      spikes, burst spikes synchronized over large distances to local field potentials 
      at narrow beta (12-20 Hz) and at gamma (50-75 Hz) frequencies. Long-range burst
      synchronization was anatomically specific, functionally connecting those
      subfields in area 24 (ACC) and area 46 (PFC) that are key players of attentional 
      control. By splitting cells into putative excitatory (pE) and inhibitory (pI)
      cells by their broad and narrow spikes, we identified that bursts of pI cells
      preceded and that bursts of pE cells followed in time periods of maximal beta
      coherent network activity. In contrast, gamma bursts were transient impulses with
      equal timing across cell classes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that
      processes underlying burst firing and burst synchronization are candidate
      mechanisms to coordinate attention information across brain areas. We speculate
      that distinct burst-firing motifs realize beta and gamma synchrony to trigger
      versus maintain functional network states during goal-directed behavior.

AB  - RATIONALE: Data indicated that zinc deficiency may contribute to the development 
      of depression; however changes induced by zinc deficiency are not fully
      described. OBJECTIVES: In the present paper we tested whether the dietary zinc
      restriction in rats causes alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)
      subunits in brain regions that are relevant to depression. METHODS: Male Sprague 
      Dawley rats were fed a zinc adequate diet (ZnA, 50 mg Zn/kg) or a zinc deficient 
      diet (ZnD, 3 mg Zn/kg) for 4 or 6weeks. Then, the behavior of the rats was
      examined in the forced swim test, sucrose intake test and social interaction
      test. Western blot assays were used to study the alterations in NMDAR subunits
      GluN2A and GluN2B and proteins associated with NMDAR signaling in the hippocampus
      (Hp) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). RESULTS: Following 4 or 6 weeks of zinc
      restriction, behavioral despair, anhedonia and a reduction of social behavior
      occurred in rats with concomitant increased expression of GluN2A and GluN2B and
      decreased expression of the PSD-95, p-CREB and BDNF protein levels in the Hp. The
      up-regulation of GluN2A protein was also found in the PFC, but only after
      prolonged (6 weeks) zinc deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure of zinc
      restriction in rats causes behavioral changes that share some similarities to the
      pathophysiology of depression. Obtained data indicated that depressive-like
      behavior induced by zinc deficiency is associated with the changes in NMDAR
      signaling pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Plastic stents, placed via endoscopy to drain pancreatic fluid
      collections (PFCs), require repeat access. Covered metal stents are larger in
      diameter and can be inserted in a single step, but can migrate. We evaluated the 
      safety and efficacy of a lumen-apposing, covered, self-expanding metal stent
      (LACSEMS) for PFC drainage. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of the
      outcomes of stent placement in 33 patients (18 men; age, 53 +/- 14 y; 28 with
      chronic pancreatitis) with symptomatic pancreatic pseudocysts and walled-off
      necrosis (>/= 6 cm with >/= 70% fluid content). Subjects were enrolled at 7
      tertiary care centers (6 in the United States and 1 in Europe) from October 2011 
      through August 2013. Cystenterostomies were created based on endoscopist
      preference. Safety outcomes included infection, bleeding, perforation, tissue
      injury, and stent migration. Efficacy end points included LACSEMS placement,
      patency, and removal, as well as 50% or more reduction in PFCs. RESULTS: The mean
      size of the patients' PFCs was 9 +/- 3.3 cm. LACSEMSs were placed successfully
      via endoscopic ultrasound guidance in 30 patients (91%); the remaining 3 patients
      received 2 double-pigtail stents. One subject could not be evaluated because of a
      pseudoaneurysm. In the patients receiving LACSEMS, PFCs resolved in 27 of 29
      (93%). Overall, PFCs resolved in 30 of 33 patients (91%). Endoscopic debridement 
      through the LACSEMS was conducted in 11 subjects. Complications (15%) included
      abdominal pain (n = 3), spontaneous stent migration, back pain (n = 1),
      access-site infection, and stent dislodgement (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: LACSEMS were 
      placed successfully in 91% of subjects with PFCs. Overall, 93% had PFC
      resolution. Advantages of LACSEMSs over other stents include single-step
      deployment and the ability to perform endoscopic debridement with minimal stent
      migration. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01419769.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prefrontal cortex (PFC) function contributes to schizophrenia onset
      and progression. However, little is known about neural mechanisms behind PFC
      functional alterations along illness stages. Recent pharmacologic studies
      indicate that glutamate dysfunction may produce increased functional
      connectivity. However, pharmacologic models of schizophrenia overlook effects of 
      illness progression on PFC function. This study compared N-methyl-D-aspartate
      glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist effects in healthy volunteers with stages
      of schizophrenia with respect to PFC functional connectivity. METHODS: First, we 
      tested ketamine effects on PFC functional connectivity in healthy volunteers in a
      data-driven way (n = 19). Next, we compared healthy subjects (n = 96) with three 
      clinical groups: individuals at high risk for schizophrenia (n = 21), people
      early in their course of schizophrenia (EC-SCZ) (n = 28), and patients with
      chronic illness (n = 20). Across independent analyses, we used data-driven global
      brain connectivity techniques restricted to PFC to identify functional
      dysconnectivity. RESULTS: Results revealed robust PFC hyperconnectivity in
      healthy volunteers administered ketamine (Cohen's d = 1.46), resembling
      individuals at high risk for schizophrenia and EC-SCZ. Hyperconnectivity was not 
      found in patients with chronic illness relative to EC-SCZ patients. Results
      provide the first evidence that ketamine effects on PFC functional connectivity
      resemble early course but not chronic schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest
      an illness phase-specific relevance of NMDAR antagonist administration for
      prefrontal dysconnectivity associated with schizophrenia. This finding has
      implications for the neurobiology of illness progression and for the widespread
      use of NMDAR antagonists in the development of therapeutics for schizophrenia.

TI  - Vaporization dynamics of volatile perfluorocarbon droplets: a theoretical model
      and in vitro validation.
PG  - 102901
LID - 10.1118/1.4894804 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Perfluorocarbon (PFC) microdroplets, called phase-change contrast agents
      (PCCAs), are a promising tool in ultrasound imaging and therapy. Interest in
      PCCAs is motivated by the fact that they can be triggered to transition from the 
      liquid state to the gas state by an externally applied acoustic pulse. This
      property opens up new approaches to applications in ultrasound medicine. Insight 
      into the physics of vaporization of PFC droplets is vital for effective use of
      PCCAs and for anticipating bioeffects. PCCAs composed of volatile PFCs (with low 
      boiling point) exhibit complex dynamic behavior: after vaporization by a short
      acoustic pulse, a PFC droplet turns into a vapor bubble which undergoes
      overexpansion and damped radial oscillation until settling to a final diameter.
      This behavior has not been well described theoretically so far. The purpose of
      our study is to develop an improved theoretical model that describes the
      vaporization dynamics of volatile PFC droplets and to validate this model by
      comparison with in vitro experimental data. METHODS: The derivation of the model 
      is based on applying the mathematical methods of fluid dynamics and
      thermodynamics to the process of the acoustic vaporization of PFC droplets. The
      used approach corrects shortcomings of the existing models. The validation of the
      model is carried out by comparing simulated results with in vitro experimental
      data acquired by ultrahigh speed video microscopy for octafluoropropane (OFP) and
      decafluorobutane (DFB) microdroplets of different sizes. RESULTS: The developed
      theory allows one to simulate the growth of a vapor bubble inside a PFC droplet
      until the liquid PFC is completely converted into vapor, and the subsequent
      overexpansion and damped oscillations of the vapor bubble, including the
      influence of an externally applied acoustic pulse. To evaluate quantitatively the
      difference between simulated and experimental results, the L2-norm errors were
      calculated for all cases where the simulated and experimental results are
      compared. These errors were found to be in the ranges of 0.043-0.067 and
      0.037-0.088 for OFP and DFB droplets, respectively. These values allow one to
      consider agreement between the simulated and experimental results as good. This
      agreement is attained by varying only 2 of 16 model parameters which describe the
      material properties of gaseous and liquid PFCs and the liquid surrounding the PFC
      droplet. The fitting parameters are the viscosity and the surface tension of the 
      surrounding liquid. All other model parameters are kept invariable. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results suggests that
      the developed model is able to correctly describe the key physical processes
      underlying the vaporization dynamics of volatile PFC droplets. The necessity of
      varying the parameters of the surrounding liquid for fitting the experimental
      curves can be explained by the fact that the parts of the initial phospholipid
      shell of PFC droplets remain on the surface of vapor bubbles at the oscillatory
      stage and their presence affects the bubble dynamics.

      measure changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb and dHb) levels
      in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during exercise, to better understand the locus of
      such changes in affective and cognitive processes. The present study tracked
      time-dependent changes in O2Hb and dHb levels in the PFC as a function of
      parametrically manipulated target exercise intensity. Near-infrared spectroscopy 
      was conducted as regular exercisers completed a 30-min bout of exercise with one 
      of three target intensities: 52% (low condition), 68% (moderate condition), or
      84% (high condition) of age-adjusted maximum heart rate. Heart rate data
      confirmed that the participants reached their goal intensities immediately, after
      10 min, or after 20 min, respectively. Data showed that O2Hb and dHb levels in
      the PFC increased as a function of both exercise load and duration. An
      84%>68%>52% difference was evident after 18 min of cycling for O2Hb and after 23 
      min of cycling for dHb. The present results add to the growing body of literature
      showing that at submaximal levels, increasing exercise intensities reliably
      promote prefrontal cerebral oxygenation.

AB  - The mammalian neocortex is a multilayered structure receiving extensive
      adrenergic projections both in rostral and caudal areas. The cellular mechanisms 
      of norepinephrine (NE) in the neocortex are incompletely understood. We used
      electrophysiology to determine whether NE modulation of synaptic transmission
      were similar in rostral versus caudal cortical areas, and in infra- versus
      supra-granular cortical layers. To address these questions we used bath
      applications of NE (20 microM) to determine its effects on pharmacologically
      isolated electrically-evoked 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)
      propionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated excitatory synaptic currents (eEPSCs),
      or gamma-amino butyric acid A receptor (GABAAR)-mediated inhibitory synaptic
      currents (eIPSCs). We monitored synaptic currents in pyramidal neurons using
      whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from supragranular layer 2/3 (L2/3) and
      infragranular layer 5 (L5) neurons in a thin-slice preparation of rat medial
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These results were compared with the effects in the
      temporal cortex (TC) under similar experimental conditions. We found that NE
      uniformly and transiently depressed eEPSCs from supragranular to infragranular
      layers in both the PFC and the TC. On the contrary, the effects of NE on eIPSC
      were area- and layer-dependent, as NE enhanced the mean amplitude in TC L2/3 and 
      PFC L5 eIPSCs (which displayed the largest saturation currents in the areas
      studied) but depressed PFC L2/3 eIPSCs, without affecting TC L5 eIPSCs. While the
      precise physiological meaning of these results is still unclear, our data are
      consistent with the existence of a dense noradrenergic-controlled GABAergic
      cortical network in the PFC, in which L5 may act as a decisional bottleneck for
      behavioral inhibition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gilbert syndrome (GS) is an inherited defect of bilirubin
      conjugation, most commonly caused by a gene mutation for the enzyme UGT1A. GS is 
      known to affect the metabolism and excretion of drugs and xenobiotics.
      Perfluorocarbon compounds (PFCs) are bio-persistent environmental contaminants
      that affect metabolic regulation. In this study, we examined the associations of 
      GS phenotype and serum PFCs in the C8 Health Study Population. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Using 2005-2006 data from a large PFC-exposure population survey, we
      compared serum PFCs concentrations between GS and non GS clinical phenotypes, in 
      a cross sectional design, adjusting for standard risk factors, including age,
      BMI, smoking status, socioeconomic status and gender. RESULTS: Among 10 PFC
      compounds considered, only perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) was seen at a
      significantly higher concentration in GS men and women. CONCLUSION: PFHxA
      exposure may be associated with GS. Our findings do not support increased
      exposure in GS for other PFCs.

      of percepts.

AB  - Nelson and Narens have proposed a metacognition model that dissociates the
      objective processing of information (object-level) and the subjective evaluation 
      of the performance (i.e., the metalevel). Neurophysiological evidence also
      indicates that the prefrontal cortices (PFC) are the brain areas which perform
      the metalevel function [1]-[3]. A corresponding neural mechanism of Nelson and
      Narens's model, called dynamic filtering theory [4], [5], indicates that
      object-level processing is distributed in the posterior cortices and regulated by
      the prefrontal cortices with a filtering or gating mechanism to select
      appropriate signals and suppress inappropriate signals and noise. Based on this
      model, a hypothesis can be developed that, in the case of uncertainty or
      overloading of object-level processing, the prefrontal cortices will become more 
      active in order to modulate signals and noise. This hypothesis is supported by a 
      recent fMRI study [6] showing that the PFC (Brodmann area 9, BA9) was activated
      when subjects were overloaded in a bimodal attentional task, compared to a
      unimodal task. Here, we report a study showing that applying repetitive
      transmagnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the BA9 in order to interfere with its
      functional activity resulted in significant increas in guessed responses,
      compared to three other control conditions (i.e., no-TMS, sham TMS on BA9, and
      rTMS on Cz). The results are compatible with the dynamic filtering theory and
      suggest that a malfunction of the PFC would weaken the quality of meta-cognitive 
      percepts and increase the number of guessed responses.

      perfluorocarbons in pigs.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/2050-6511-15-53 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The respiratory properties of perfluorocarbons (PFC) have been widely
      studied for liquid ventilation in humans and animals. Several PFC were tested but
      their tolerance may depend on the species. Here, the effects of a single
      administration of liquid PFC into pig lungs were assessed and compared. Three
      different PFC having distinct evaporative and spreading coefficient properties
      were evaluated (Perfluorooctyl bromide [PFOB], perfluorodecalin [PFD] and
      perfluoro-N-octane [PFOC]). METHODS: Pigs were anesthetized and submitted to
      mechanical ventilation. They randomly received an intra-tracheal administration
      of 15 ml/kg of either PFOB, PFD or PFOC with 12 h of mechanical ventilation
      before awakening and weaning from ventilation. A Control group was submitted to
      mechanical ventilation with no PFC administration. All animals were followed
      during 4 days after the initial PFC administration to investigate gas exchanges
      and clinical recovery. They were ultimately euthanized for histological analyses 
      and assessment of PFC residual concentrations within the lungs using dual nuclei 
      fluorine and hydrogen Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Sixteen animals were
      included (4/group). RESULTS: In the PFD group, animals tended to be hypoxemic
      after awakening. In PFOB and PFOC groups, blood gases were not significantly
      different from the Control group after awakening. The poor tolerance of PFD was
      likely related to a large amount of residual PFC, as observed using MRI in all
      lung samples ( approximately 10% of lung volume). This percentage was lower in
      the PFOB group ( approximately 1%) but remained significantly greater than in the
      Control group. In the PFOC group, the percentage of residual PFC was not
      significantly different from that of the Control group ( approximately 0.1%).
      Histologically, the most striking feature was an alveolar infiltration with foam 
      macrophages, especially in the groups treated by PFD or PFOB. CONCLUSIONS: Of the
      three tested perfluorocarbons, PFOC offered the best tolerance in terms of lung
      function, gas exchanges and residuum in the lung. PFOC was rapidly cleared from
      the lungs and virtually disappeared after 4 days whereas PFOB persisted at
      significant levels and led to foam macrophage infiltration. PFOC could be
      relevant for short term total liquid ventilation with a rapid weaning.

AB  - Effective real-world communication requires the alignment of multiple individuals
      to a common perspective or mental framework. To study how this alignment occurs
      at the level of the brain, we measured BOLD response during fMRI while
      participants (n = 24) listened to a series of vignettes either in the presence or
      absence of a valid contextual cue. The valid contextual cue was necessary to
      understand the information in each vignette. We then examined where and to what
      extent the shared valid context led to greater intersubject similarity of neural 
      processing. Regions of the default mode network including posterior cingulate
      cortex and medial pFC became more aligned when participants shared a valid
      contextual framework, whereas other regions, including primary sensory cortices, 
      responded to the stimuli reliably regardless of contextual factors. Taken in
      conjunction with previous research, the present results suggest that default mode
      regions help the brain to organize incoming verbal information in the context of 
      previous knowledge.

LID - 10.1002/mrm.25454 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cellular therapeutics are emerging as a treatment option for a host of
      serious human diseases. To accelerate clinical translation, noninvasive imaging
      of cell grafts in clinical trials can potentially be used to assess the initial
      delivery and behavior of cells. METHODS: The use of a perfluorocarbon (PFC)
      tracer agent for clinical fluorine-19 ((19) F) MRI cell detection is described.
      This technology was used to detect immunotherapeutic dendritic cells (DCs)
      delivered to colorectal adenocarcinoma patients. Autologous DC vaccines were
      labeled with a PFC MRI agent ex vivo. Patients received DCs intradermally, and
      (19) F spin-density-weighted MRI at 3 Tesla (T) was used to observe cells.
      RESULTS: Spin-density-weighted (19) F images at the injection site displayed DCs 
      as background-free "hot-spot" images. (19) F images were acquired in clinically
      relevant scan times (<10 min). Apparent DC numbers could be quantified in two
      patients from the (19) F hot-spots and were observed to decrease by approximately
      50% at injection site by 24 h. From 3T phantom studies, the sensitivity limit for
      DC detection is estimated to be on the order of approximately 10(5) cells/voxel
      in this study. CONCLUSION: These results help to establish a clinically
      applicable means to track a broad range of cell types used in cell therapy.

TI  - Neural substrates of approach-avoidance conflict decision-making.
PG  - 449-62
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22639 [doi]
AB  - Animal approach-avoidance conflict paradigms have been used extensively to
      operationalize anxiety, quantify the effects of anxiolytic agents, and probe the 
      neural basis of fear and anxiety. Results from human neuroimaging studies support
      that a frontal-striatal-amygdala neural circuitry is important for
      approach-avoidance learning. However, the neural basis of decision-making is much
      less clear in this context. Thus, we combined a recently developed human
      approach-avoidance paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to 
      identify neural substrates underlying approach-avoidance conflict
      decision-making. Fifteen healthy adults completed the approach-avoidance conflict
      (AAC) paradigm during fMRI. Analyses of variance were used to compare conflict to
      nonconflict (avoid-threat and approach-reward) conditions and to compare level of
      reward points offered during the decision phase. Trial-by-trial amplitude
      modulation analyses were used to delineate brain areas underlying decision-making
      in the context of approach/avoidance behavior. Conflict trials as compared to the
      nonconflict trials elicited greater activation within bilateral anterior
      cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and caudate, as well as right dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). Right caudate and lateral PFC activation was modulated
      by level of reward offered. Individuals who showed greater caudate activation
      exhibited less approach behavior. On a trial-by-trial basis, greater right
      lateral PFC activation related to less approach behavior. Taken together, results
      suggest that the degree of activation within prefrontal-striatal-insula circuitry
      determines the degree of approach versus avoidance decision-making. Moreover, the
      degree of caudate and lateral PFC activation related to individual differences in
      approach-avoidance decision-making. Therefore, the approach-avoidance conflict
      paradigm is ideally suited to probe anxiety-related processing differences during
      approach-avoidance decision-making.

TI  - Solid-liquid surface tensions of critical nuclei and nucleation barriers from a
      phase-field-crystal study of a model binary alloy using finite system sizes.
PG  - 022403
AB  - Phase-field-crystal (PFC) modeling has emerged as a computationally efficient
      tool to address crystal growth phenomena on atomistic length and diffusive time
      scales. We use a two-dimensional phase-field-crystal model for a binary system
      based on Elder et al. [Phys. Rev. B 75, 064107 (2007)] to study critical nuclei
      and their liquid-solid phase boundaries, in particular the nucleus size
      dependence of the liquid-solid interface tension as well as of the nucleation
      barrier. Critical nuclei are stabilized in finite systems of various sizes,
      however, the extracted interface tension as function of the nucleus radius r is
      independent of system size. We suggest a phenomenological expression to describe 
      the dependence of the extracted interface tension on the nucleus radius r for the
      liquid-solid system. Moreover, the numerical PFC results show that this
      dependency can not be fully described by the nonclassical Tolman formula.

AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a prominent perfluorinated compound (PFC), has
      been widely detected in natural water bodies worldwide. In this study, zebrafish 
      (Danio rerio) was exposed to nominal concentrations of PFOA (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 
      1 mg/L) for 21 d. After exposure, each fish was decapitated, and the spleen was
      removed to detect the expression patterns of P65 transcription factor, myeloid
      differentiation 88, relative interleukins (ILs), and antibody genes. PFOA can
      stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine at a low exposure concentration (0.05 mg/L)
      and can inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine at higher exposure concentrations (>/= 
      0.1mg/L). The results of linear correlation analysis indicate that
      Myd88/NF-kappaB pathway is one of the important pathways to mediate inflammatory 
      cytokine (IL-1beta and IL-21) in zebrafish spleen. Additionally, the relative
      mRNA expression level of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) at 1mg/L PFOA group was
      decreased to 56% of its corresponding level in the control. IL secretion disorder
      is possibly closely related to PFOA-induced TLR2 damage in zebrafish spleen.
      Furthermore, data show that the trends of PFOA-induced IL secretion have a
      relationship with Ig-secreting trend. This study demonstrates that PFOA can
      affect IL expression level through NF-kappaB, and ILs have an important function 
      in the mediation of Ig secretion.

TI  - In vitro surfactant and perfluorocarbon aerosol deposition in a neonatal physical
      model of the upper conducting airways.
PG  - e106835
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0106835 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aerosol delivery holds potential to release surfactant or
      perfluorocarbon (PFC) to the lungs of neonates with respiratory distress syndrome
      with minimal airway manipulation. Nevertheless, lung deposition in neonates tends
      to be very low due to extremely low lung volumes, narrow airways and high
      respiratory rates. In the present study, the feasibility of enhancing lung
      deposition by intracorporeal delivery of aerosols was investigated using a
      physical model of neonatal conducting airways. METHODS: The main characteristics 
      of the surfactant and PFC aerosols produced by a nebulization system, including
      the distal air pressure and air flow rate, liquid flow rate and mass median
      aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), were measured at different driving pressures (4-7
      bar). Then, a three-dimensional model of the upper conducting airways of a
      neonate was manufactured by rapid prototyping and a deposition study was
      conducted. RESULTS: The nebulization system produced relatively large amounts of 
      aerosol ranging between 0.3+/-0.0 ml/min for surfactant at a driving pressure of 
      4 bar, and 2.0+/-0.1 ml/min for distilled water (H2Od) at 6 bar, with MMADs
      between 2.61+/-0.1 microm for PFD at 7 bar and 10.18+/-0.4 microm for FC-75 at 6 
      bar. The deposition study showed that for surfactant and H2Od aerosols, the
      highest percentage of the aerosolized mass ( approximately 65%) was collected
      beyond the third generation of branching in the airway model. The use of this
      delivery system in combination with continuous positive airway pressure set at 5 
      cmH2O only increased total airway pressure by 1.59 cmH2O at the highest driving
      pressure (7 bar). CONCLUSION: This aerosol generating system has the potential to
      deliver relatively large amounts of surfactant and PFC beyond the third
      generation of branching in a neonatal airway model with minimal alteration of
      pre-set respiratory support.

TI  - Age-related differences in functional connectivity during cognitive emotion
      regulation.
PG  - 852-60
LID - 10.1093/geronb/gbu108 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Successful emotion regulation partly depends on our capacity to
      modulate emotional responses through the use of cognitive strategies. Age may
      affect the strategies employed most often; thus, we examined younger and older
      adults' neural network connectivity when employing two different strategies:
      cognitive reappraisal and selective attention. METHOD: The current study used
      psychophysiological interaction analyses to examine functional connectivity with 
      a region of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) because it is a core part of an
      emotion regulation network showing relative structural preservation with age.
      RESULTS: Functional connectivity between ACC and prefrontal cortex (PFC) was
      greater for reappraisal relative to selective attention and passive viewing
      conditions for both age groups. For younger adults, ACC was more strongly
      connected with lateral dorsolateral PFC, ventrolateral PFC, dorsomedial PFC, and 
      posterior cingulate regions during reappraisal. For older adults, stronger
      connectivity during reappraisal was observed primarily in ventromedial PFC and
      orbitofrontal cortex. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that although young and
      older adults engage PFC networks during regulation, and particularly during
      reappraisal, the regions within these networks might differ. Additionally, these 
      results clarify that, despite prior evidence for age-related declines in the
      structure and function of those regions, older adults are able to recruit ACC and
      PFC regions as part of coherent network during emotion regulation.

TI  - Neural emotion regulation circuitry underlying anxiolytic effects of perceived
      control over pain.
PG  - 222-33
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00702 [doi]
AB  - Anxiolytic effects of perceived control have been observed across species. In
      humans, neuroimaging studies have suggested that perceived control and cognitive 
      reappraisal reduce negative affect through similar mechanisms. An important
      limitation of extant neuroimaging studies of perceived control in terms of
      directly testing this hypothesis, however, is the use of within-subject designs, 
      which confound participants' affective response to controllable and
      uncontrollable stress. To compare neural and affective responses when
      participants were exposed to either uncontrollable or controllable stress, two
      groups of participants received an identical series of stressors (thermal pain
      stimuli). One group ("controllable") was led to believe they had behavioral
      control over the pain stimuli, whereas another ("uncontrollable") believed they
      had no control. Controllable pain was associated with decreased state anxiety,
      decreased activation in amygdala, and increased activation in nucleus accumbens. 
      In participants who perceived control over the pain, reduced state anxiety was
      associated with increased functional connectivity between each of these regions
      and ventral lateral/ventral medial pFC. The location of pFC findings is
      consistent with regions found to be critical for the anxiolytic effects of
      perceived control in rodents. Furthermore, interactions observed between pFC and 
      both amygdala and nucleus accumbens are remarkably similar to neural mechanisms
      of emotion regulation through reappraisal in humans. These results suggest that
      perceived control reduces negative affect through a general mechanism involved in
      the cognitive regulation of emotion.

TI  - Person-specific theory of mind in medial pFC.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00700 [doi]
AB  - Although research on theory of mind has strongly implicated the dorsomedial pFC
      (incuding medial BA 8 and BA 9), the unique contributions of medial pFC (MPFC;
      corresponding to medial BA 10) to mentalizing remain uncertain. The extant
      literature has considered the possibility that these regions may be specialized
      for self-related cognition or for reasoning about close others, but evidence for 
      both accounts has been inconclusive. We propose a novel theoretical framework:
      MPFC selectively implements "person-specific theories of mind" (ToMp)
      representing the unique, idiosyncratic traits or attributes of well-known
      individuals. To test this hypothesis, we used fMRI to assess MPFC responses in
      Democratic and Republican participants as they evaluated more or less
      subjectively well-known political figures. Consistent with the ToMp account, MPFC
      showed greater activity to subjectively well-known targets, irrespective of
      participants' reported feelings of closeness or similarity. MPFC also
      demonstrated greater activity on trials in which targets (whether politicians or 
      oneself) were judged to be relatively idiosyncratic, making a generic theory of
      mind inapplicable. These results suggest that MPFC may supplement the generic
      theory of mind process, with which dorsomedial pFC has been associated, by
      contributing mentalizing capacities tuned to individuated representations of
      specific well-known others.

AB  - Understanding how malnutrition contributes to depression is building momentum. In
      the present study we unravel molecular and cellular mechanisms by which
      nutritional disturbances lead to impaired emotional behaviour in mice. Here we
      report that nutritional n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) deficiency induces
      a chronic stress state reflected by disrupted glucocorticoid receptor
      (GR)-mediated signalling pathway along with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
      axis hyperactivity. This hyperactivity in turn resulted in neuronal atrophy in
      the dorsolateral (dl)- and dorsomedial (dm)- prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
      subsequent mood-related behaviour alterations, similarly to chronic social defeat
      stress. Supplementation of n-3 PUFA prevented detrimental chronic social defeat
      stress-induced emotional and neuronal impairments by impeding HPA axis
      hyperactivity. These results indicate a role for dietary n-3 PUFA in the
      prevention of HPA axis dysfunction associated with the development of some
      neuropsychiatric disorders including depression.

AB  - Recent actions can benefit or disrupt our current actions and the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) is thought to play a major role in the regulation of these actions
      before they occur. The left PFC has been associated with overcoming interference 
      from past events in the context of language production and working memory. The
      right PFC, and especially the right IFG, has been associated with preparatory
      inhibition processes. But damage to the right PFC has also been associated with
      impairment in sustaining actions in motor intentional disorders. Moreover,
      bilateral dorsolateral PFC has been associated with the ability to maintain
      task-sets, and improve the performance of current actions based on previous
      experience. However, potential hemispheric asymmetries in anticipatory regulation
      of action have not yet been delineated. In the present study, patients with left 
      (n=7) vs. right (n=6) PFC damage due to stroke and 14 aged- and education-matched
      controls performed a picture naming and a verbal Simon task (participants had to 
      say "right" or "left" depending on the color of the picture while ignoring its
      position). In both tasks, performance depended on the nature of the preceding
      trial, but in different ways. In the naming task, performance decreased if
      previous pictures were from the same rather than from different semantic
      categories (i.e., semantic interference effect). In the Simon task, performance
      was better for both compatible (i.e., response matching the position of the
      stimulus) and incompatible trials when preceded by a trial of the same
      compatibility (i.e. Gratton effect) relative to sequential trials of different
      compatibility. Left PFC patients were selectively impaired in picture naming;
      they had an increased semantic interference effect compared to both right PFC
      patients and aged-matched controls. Conversely, right PFC patients were
      selectively impaired in the Simon task compared to controls or left PFC patients;
      they showed no benefit when sequential trials were compatible (cC vs. iC trials) 
      or a decreased Gratton effect. These results provide evidence for a double
      dissociation between left and right PFC in the anticipatory regulation of action.
      Our results are in agreement with a preponderant role of the left PFC in
      overcoming proactive interference from competing memory representations and
      provide evidence that the right PFC, plays a role in sustaining goal-directed
      actions consistent with clinical data in right PFC patients with motor
      intentional disorders.

PG  - 38-50
LID - 10.1111/jnc.12941 [doi]
AB  - alpha1 -adrenoceptors (alpha1 -ARs) stimulation has been found to enhance
      excitatory processes in many brain regions. A recent study in our laboratory
      showed that alpha1 -ARs stimulation enhances glutamatergic transmission via both 
      pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms in layer V/VI pyramidal cells of the rat medial
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, a number of pre-synaptic mechanisms may
      contribute to alpha1 -ARs-induced enhancement of glutamate release. In this
      study, we blocked the possible post-synaptic action mediated by alpha1 -ARs to
      investigate how alpha1 -ARs activation regulates pre-synaptic glutamate release
      in layer V/VI pyramidal neurons of mPFC. We found that the alpha1 -ARs agonist
      phenylephrine (Phe) induced a significant enhancement of glutamatergic
      transmission. The Phe-induced potentiation was mediated by enhancing pre-synaptic
      glutamate release probability and increasing the number of release vesicles via a
      protein kinase C-dependent pathway. The mechanisms of Phe-induced potentiation
      included interaction with both glutamate release machinery and N-type Ca(2+)
      channels, probably via a pre-synaptic Gq /phospholipase C/protein kinase C
      pathway. Our results may provide a cellular and molecular mechanism that helps
      explain alpha1 -ARs-mediated influence on PFC cognitive functions. Alpha1

      trait-level sensitivity to reward due to more post-synaptic dopamine in the PFC. 
      A physiological mediator of this association may be greater relative left
      asymmetry in the PFC, a putative biomarker for trait positive emotionality.
      Electroencephalograms of 120 participants were measured during a task that
      assesses two aspects of reward processing: pre-reward anticipation and
      post-reward consummatory affect. Participants provided genetics samples and
      completed the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS), which assesses
      trait-level anticipatory and consummatory positive affect. Met carriers had
      higher TEPS-Consummatory scores. This effect was mediated by greater relative
      left activation in the post-reward phase of the task. No effects were observed
      for the pre-reward phase. Results suggest that frontal asymmetry is an
      endophenotype between COMT genotype and trait reward responsivity.

AB  - Epidemiological studies suggest that perinatal complications, particularly
      hypoxia-related ones, increase the risk of schizophrenia. Recent genetic studies 
      of the disorder have identified several putative susceptibility genes, some of
      which are known to be regulated by hypoxia. It can be postulated therefore that
      birth complications that cause hypoxia in the fetal brain may be associated with 
      a dysregulation in the expression of some of the schizophrenia candidate genes.
      To test this, we used an animal model of perinatal asphyxia, in which rat pups
      were exposed to 15 min of intrauterine anoxia during Caesarean section birth, and
      examined the expression of mRNA of five of the putative susceptibility genes
      (NRG1, ErbB4, AKT1, COMT and BDNF) by real-time quantitative PCR in the medial
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus at 6 and 12 weeks after birth. The
      expression of NRG1 mRNA was significantly decreased in the mPFC, but not in the
      hippocampus, at 6 and 12 weeks after birth. In addition, a significant increase
      in COMT mRNA expression was observed in the mPFC at 12 weeks. The alteration in
      mRNA levels of NRG1 and COMT was not associated with a change in their protein
      levels. These results suggest that perinatal asphyxia may lead to disturbances in
      the PFC, which in turn may exert a long-lasting influence on the expression of
      specific genes, such as NRG1 and COMT. Our results also suggest that
      translational interruption may occur in this model of perinatal asphyxia.

AB  - Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) have recently received scientific and regulatory 
      attention due to their broad environmental distribution, persistence,
      bioaccumulative potential, and toxicity. Studies suggest that fish consumption
      may be a source of human exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or
      long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Most PFC fish tissue literature focuses on 
      marine fish and waters outside of the United States (U.S.). To broaden
      assessments in U.S. fish, a characterization of PFCs in freshwater fish was
      initiated on a national scale using an unequal probability design during the U.S.
      Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) 2008-2009 National Rivers and Streams
      Assessment (NRSA) and the Great Lakes Human Health Fish Tissue Study component of
      the 2010 EPA National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA/GL). Fish were collected
      from randomly selected locations--164 urban river sites and 157 nearshore Great
      Lake sites. The probability design allowed extrapolation to the sampled
      population of 17,059 km in urban rivers and a nearshore area of 11,091 km(2) in
      the Great Lakes. Fillets were analyzed for 13 PFCs using high-performance liquid 
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results showed that PFOS dominated in
      frequency of occurrence, followed by three other longer-chain PFCs
      (perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid, and perfluorododecanoic acid).
      Maximum PFOS concentrations were 127 and 80 ng/g in urban river samples and Great
      Lakes samples, respectively. The range of NRSA PFOS detections was similar to
      literature accounts from targeted riverine fish sampling. NCCA/GL PFOS levels
      were lower than those reported by other Great Lakes researchers, but generally
      higher than values in targeted inland lake studies. The probability design
      allowed development of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) to quantify PFOS 
      concentrations versus the sampled population, and the application of fish
      consumption advisory guidance to the CDFs resulted in an estimation of the
      proportion of urban rivers and the Great Lakes that exceed human health
      protection thresholds.

TI  - Schema representation in patients with ventromedial PFC lesions.
PG  - 12057-70
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0740-14.2014 [doi]
AB  - Human neuroimaging and animal studies have recently implicated the ventromedial
      prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in memory schema, particularly in facilitating new
      encoding by existing schemas. In humans, the most conspicuous memory disorder
      following vmPFC damage is confabulation; strategic retrieval models suggest that 
      aberrant schema activation or reinstatement plays a role in confabulation. This
      raises the possibility that beyond its role in schema-supported memory encoding, 
      the vmPFC is also implicated in schema reinstatement itself. If that is the case,
      vmPFC lesions should lead to impaired schema-based operations, even on tasks that
      do not involve memory acquisition. To test this prediction, ten patients with
      vmPFC damage, four with present or prior confabulation, and a group of twelve
      matched healthy controls made speeded yes/no decisions as to whether words were
      closely related to a schema (a visit to the doctor). Ten minutes later, they
      repeated the task for a new schema (going to bed) with some words related to the 
      first schema included as lures. Last, they rated the degree to which stimuli were
      related to the second schema. All four vmPFC patients with present or prior
      confabulation were impaired in rejecting lures and in classifying stimulus
      belongingness to the schema, even when they were not lures. Nonconfabulating
      patients performed comparably to healthy adults with high accuracy, comparable
      reaction times, and similar ratings. These results show for the first time that
      damage to the human vmPFC, when associated with confabulation, leads to deficient
      schema reinstatement, which is likely a prerequisite for schema-mediated memory
      integration.

TI  - Neural correlates of gender differences in reputation building.
PG  - e106285
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0106285 [doi]
AB  - Gender differences in cooperative choices and their neural correlates were
      investigated in a situation where reputation represented a crucial issue. Males
      and females were involved in an economic exchange (trust game) where economic and
      reputational payoffs had to be balanced in order to increase personal welfare. At
      the behavioral level, females showed a stronger reaction to negative reputation
      judgments that led to higher cooperation than males, measured by back transfers
      in the game. The neuroanatomical counterpart of this gender difference was found 
      within the reward network (engaged in producing expectations of positive results)
      and reputation-related brain networks, such as the self-control network (engaged 
      in strategically resisting the temptation to defect) and the mentalizing network 
      (engaged in thinking about how one is viewed by others), in which the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the medial (M)PFC respectively play a 
      crucial role. Furthermore, both DLPFC and MPFC activity correlated with the
      amount of back transfer, as well as with the personality dimensions assessed with
      the Big-Five Questionnaire (BFQ-2). Males, according to their greater DLPFC
      recruitment and their higher level of the BFQ-2 subscale of Dominance, were more 
      focused on implementing a profit-maximizing strategy, pursuing this target
      irrespectively of others' judgments. On the contrary, females, according to their
      greater MPFC activity and their lower level of Dominance, were more focused on
      the reputation per se and not on the strategic component of reputation building. 
      These findings shed light on the sexual dimorphism related to cooperative
      behavior and its neural correlates.

TI  - Sleep deprivation induces differential morphological changes in the hippocampus

PG  - 15-25

AB  - Sleep is a fundamental state necessary for maintenance of physical and
      neurological homeostasis throughout life. Several studies regarding the functions
      of sleep have been focused on effects of sleep deprivation on synaptic plasticity
      at a molecular and electrophysiological level, and only a few studies have
      studied sleep function from a structural perspective. Moreover, during normal
      aging, sleep architecture displays some changes that could affect normal
      development in the elderly. In this study, using a Golgi-Cox staining followed by
      Sholl analysis, we evaluate the effects of 24 h of total sleep deprivation on
      neuronal morphology of pyramidal neurons from Layer III of the prefrontal cortex 
      (PFC) and the dorsal hippocampal CA1 region from male Wistar rats at two
      different ages (3 and 22 months). We found no differences in total dendritic
      length and branching length in both analyzed regions after sleep deprivation.
      Spine density was reduced in the CA1 of young-adults, and interestingly, sleep
      deprivation increased spine density in PFC of aged animals. Taken together, our
      results show that 24 h of total sleep deprivation have different effects on
      synaptic plasticity and could play a beneficial role in cognition during aging.

AB  - It is widely assumed that cognitive functions decline with age and that these
      decrements are associated with age-related changes in patterns of functional
      activity. However, these functional changes may be due to age-related increased
      responsiveness to task demands and not to other cognitive processes on which
      neural and behavioural responses rely, since many ageing studies use task
      paradigms that may not be orthogonal to the cognitive function being
      investigated. Here we test this hypothesis in adults aged 20-86 years by
      combining measures of language comprehension, functional connectivity and neural 
      integrity to identify functional networks activated in two language experiments
      with varying task demands. In one, participants listened to spoken sentences
      without performing an overt task (the natural listening condition) while in the
      other they performed a task in response to the same sentences. Using task-based
      ICA of fMRI, we identified a left-lateralised frontotemporal network associated
      with syntactic analysis, which remained consistently activated regardless of task
      demands. In contrast, in the task condition only a separate set of components
      showed task-specific activity in Opercular, Frontoparietal, and bilateral PFC.
      Only the PFC showed age-related increases in activation which, furthermore, was
      strongly mediated by grey matter health. These results suggest that, contrary to 
      prevailing views, age-related changes in cognitive activation may be due in part 
      to differential responses to task-related processes.

AB  - The endogenous opioid system is involved in ethanol reinforcement.
      Ethanol-induced changes in opioidergic transmission have been extensively studied
      in adult organisms. However, the impact of ethanol exposure at low or moderate
      doses during early ontogeny has been barely explored. We investigated the effect 
      of prenatal ethanol exposure on alcohol intake and Methionine-enkephalin
      (Met-enk) content in rat offspring. Met-enk content was assessed in the ventral
      tegmental area [VTA], nucleus accumbens [NAcc], prefrontal cortex [PFC],
      substantia nigra [SN], caudate-putamen [CP], amygdala, hypothalamus and
      hippocampus. Pregnant rats were treated with ethanol (2g/kg) or water during GDs 
      17-20. At PDs 14 and 15, preweanlings were evaluated in an intake test (5% and
      10% ethanol, or water). Met-enk content in brain regions of infants prenatally
      exposed to ethanol was quantitated by radioimmunoassay. Ethanol consumption was
      facilitated by prenatal experience with the drug, particularly in females.
      Met-enk content in mesocorticolimbic regions - PFC and NAcc - was increased as a 
      consequence of prenatal exposure to ethanol. Conversely, Met-enk levels in the
      VTA were reduced by prenatal ethanol manipulation. Prenatal ethanol also
      increased peptide levels in the medial-posterior zone of the CP, and strongly
      augmented Met-enk content in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. These findings
      show that prenatal ethanol exposure stimulates consumption of the drug in infant 
      rats, and induces selective changes in Met-enk levels in regions of the
      mesocorticolimbic and nigrostriatal systems, the hypothalamus and hippocampus.
      Our results support the role of mesocorticolimbic enkephalins in ethanol
      reinforcement in offspring, as has been reported in adults.

AB  - Past research finds that age-related increases in false recognitions are a key
      contributor to age-related memory decline, suggesting that older adults have
      difficulty in correctly distinguishing between new and old information,
      particularly when new items at retrieval are semantically or perceptually related
      to items from encoding. However, little work has examined the neural mechanisms
      older adults engage to avoid false recognitions and successfully identify
      information as novel. In the present study, young and older adults were scanned
      during a retrieval task in which new items were exemplars from studied categories
      (related lures) or unstudied categories (unrelated lures) in order to detect
      age-related differences in the neural correlates of related and unrelated novelty
      processing. Results showed that, unlike young adults, older adults did not
      differentially recruit regions such as the anterior cingulate and bilateral
      middle/inferior temporal gyrus to capitalize on the salient categorical
      differences in unrelated items. Likewise, older adults did not differentially
      recruit regions of early visual cortex or anterior hippocampus, suggesting that
      older adults have difficulty using item-specific details to make successful
      related novelty decisions. Instead, older adults recruited bilateral
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex differentially for successful novelty processing 
      and particularly for related novelty processing. Overall, results suggest that
      age deficits in novelty processing may arise because older adults process related
      and unrelated lures similarly and do not capitalize on categorical or
      item-specific properties of novel items. Similar to aging patterns in memory
      retrieval, results also showed that older adults have the strongest novelty
      success activity in lateral PFC regions associated with control and monitoring
      processes. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Memory & Aging.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of affective picture processing revealed by intracranial 
      high-gamma modulations.
PG  - 16-28
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22609 [doi]
AB  - Our comprehension of the neural mechanisms underlying emotional information
      processing has largely benefited from noninvasive electrophysiological and
      functional neuroimaging techniques in recent years. However, the spatiotemporal
      dynamics of the neural events occurring during emotional processing remain
      imprecise due to the limited combination of spatial and temporal resolution
      provided by these techniques. This study examines the modulations of
      high-frequency activity of intracranial electroencephalography recordings
      associated with affective picture valence, in epileptic patients awaiting
      neurosurgery. Recordings were obtained from subdural grids and depth electrodes
      in eight patients while they viewed a series of unpleasant, pleasant and neutral 
      pictures from the International Affective Picture System. Broadband high-gamma
      (70-150 Hz) power was computed for separate 100-ms time windows and compared
      according to ratings of emotional valence. Compared to emotionally neutral or
      pleasant pictures, unpleasant stimuli were associated with an early and
      long-lasting ( approximately 200-1,000 ms) bilateral increase in high-gamma
      activity in visual areas of the occipital and temporal lobes, together with a
      late and transient ( approximately 500-800 ms) decrease found bilaterally in the 
      lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Pleasant pictures were associated with increased
      gamma activity in the occipital cortex, compared to the emotionally neutral
      stimuli. Consistent with previous studies, our results provide direct evidence of
      emotion-related modulations in the visual ventral pathway during picture
      processing. Results in the lateral PFC also shed light on the neural mechanisms
      underlying its role in negative emotions processing. This study demonstrates the 
      utility of intracranial high-gamma modulations to study emotional process with a 
      high spatiotemporal precision.

TI  - Behavioral effects of glucocorticoids during the first exposures to the forced
      swim stress.
PG  - 851-60
LID - 10.1007/s00213-014-3718-8 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Glucocorticoids facilitate coping with stress, but their high levels
      have been also implicated in mood disorders. Due to this duality, the role of
      glucocorticoid signaling in the development of the first episodes of
      stress-induced depression remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To address this issue,
      effects of the glucocorticoid signal modulation on depressive-like behavior
      during pretest and test Porsolt swim sessions were examined. METHODS: Metyrapone 
      (MET; 150 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected 3 h before pretest to block stress-induced
      increase in corticosterone levels. Dexamethasone (DEX; 0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) was
      applied to MET-treated rats 1 h before both pretest and test sessions. In
      addition to behavior during these sessions, glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
      expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry 2 h after the second swim.
      RESULTS: In pretest, MET-treated rats exhibited increased latency to immobility
      and shortened immobility. DEX reversed the behavioral effects of MET in the
      pretest. In the test, animals from MET + DEX group unexpectedly exhibited an
      antidepressant-like behavior. Swim stress increased GR expression in the frontal 
      cortex irrespective of the pharmacological treatment. A significant elevation in 
      GR expression was found in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of stressed MET +
      DEX-treated rats and in the PFC of unstressed rats 6 h after injection of DEX
      alone. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that the increase in glucocorticoid levels
      under swim stress during pretest directly contributes to the development of the
      immobility response. Transition of DEX effect from prodepressant in the pretest
      to an antidepressant in the test was associated with the elevation in the PFC GR 
      expression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adult posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been characterized by 
      altered fear-network connectivity. Childhood trauma is a major risk factor for
      adult PTSD, yet its contribution to fear-network connectivity in PTSD remains
      unexplored. We examined, within a single model, the contribution of childhood
      maltreatment, combat exposure, and combat-related posttraumatic stress symptoms
      (PTSS) to resting-state connectivity (rs-FC) of the amygdala and hippocampus in
      military veterans. METHODS: Medication-free male veterans (n = 27, average 26.6
      years) with a range of PTSS completed resting-state fMRI. Measures including the 
      Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ),
      and Combat Exposure Scale (CES) were used to predict rs-FC using multilinear
      regression. Fear-network seeds included the amygdala and hippocampus. RESULTS:
      Amygdala: CTQ predicted lower connectivity to ventromedial prefrontal cortex
      (vmPFC), but greater anticorrelation with dorsal/lateral PFC. CAPS positively
      predicted connectivity to insula, and loss of anticorrelation with
      dorsomedial/dorsolateral (dm/dl)PFC. Hippocampus: CTQ predicted lower
      connectivity to vmPFC, but greater anticorrelation with dm/dlPFC. CES predicted
      greater anticorrelation, whereas CAPS predicted less anticorrelation with dmPFC. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Childhood trauma, combat exposure, and PTSS differentially predict
      fear-network rs-FC. Childhood maltreatment may weaken ventral
      prefrontal-subcortical circuitry important in automatic fear regulation, but, in 
      a compensatory manner, may also strengthen dorsal prefrontal-subcortical pathways
      involved in more effortful emotion regulation. PTSD symptoms, in turn, appear to 
      emerge with the loss of connectivity in the latter pathway. These findings
      suggest potential mechanisms by which developmental trauma exposure leads to
      adult PTSD, and which brain mechanisms are associated with the emergence of PTSD 
      symptoms.

AB  - Current evidence supports that inflammation and increased cytokine levels are
      associated with depression-like symptoms and neuropsychological disturbances in
      humans. Curcumin has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-depressant-like
      properties. Here, we examined the effects of curcumin on lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS)-induced depressive-like behavior and inflammation in male mice. A single
      administration of LPS (0.83mg/kg, i.p.) increased the immobility time in the
      forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), reduced sucrose
      consumption without affecting spontaneous locomotor activity. Pretreatment with
      curcumin (50mg/kg, i.p.) for 7 consecutive days reversed LPS-induced alterations 
      in the FST, TST, and sucrose preference test. Moreover, pre-treatment with
      curcumin attenuated LPS-induced microglial activation and overproduction of
      pro-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha), as
      well as the levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA
      in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). In addition, curcumin ameliorated
      LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in the hippocampus and PFC. The results
      demonstrate that curcumin may be an effective therapeutic agent for LPS-induced
      depressive-like behavior, partially due to its anti-inflammatory aptitude.

AB  - We have previously demonstrated that male rats exposed to stress during the last 
      week of gestation present age-specific impairments of brain development. Since
      the organization of the fetal developing brain is subject to androgen exposure
      and prenatal stress was reported to disrupt perinatal testosterone surges, the
      aim of this research was to explore whether abnormal androgen concentrations
      during late gestation affects the morphology of the prefrontal cortex (PFC),
      hippocampus (HPC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), three major areas that were
      shown to be affected by prenatal stress in our previous studies. We administered 
      10-mg/kg/day of the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide
      (4'nitro-3'-trifluoromethylsobutyranilide) or vehicle injections to pregnant rats
      from days 15-21 of gestation. The antiandrogenic effects of flutamide were
      confirmed by the analysis of androgen-dependent developmental markers:
      flutamide-exposed rats showed reduced anogenital distance, delay in the
      completion of testis descent, hypospadias, cryptorchidism and atrophied seminal
      vesicles. Brain morphological studies revealed that prenatal flutamide decreased 
      the number of MAP2 (a microtubule-associated protein type 2, present almost
      exclusively in dendrites) immunoreactive neuronal processes in all evaluated
      brain areas, both in prepubertal and adult offspring, suggesting that prenatal
      androgen disruption induces long-term reductions of the dendritic arborization of
      several brain structures, affecting the normal connectivity between areas.
      Moreover, the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunopositive neurons in the
      VTA of prepubertal offspring was reduced in flutamide rats but reach normal
      values at adulthood. Our results demonstrate that the effects of prenatal
      flutamide on the offspring brain morphology resemble several prenatal stress
      effects suggesting that the mechanism of action of prenatal stress might be
      related to the impairment of the organizational role of androgens on brain
      development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies in which Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation 
      (A-tDCS) has been used to improve language production have focused on single
      words. Yet sentence production requires more than lexical retrieval. For example,
      successful suppression of the past and careful planning of the future are two
      critical requirements for producing a correct sentence. Can A-tDCS improves
      those, and by extension, production at the sentence level? OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: 
      Given that many aspects of sentence production beyond word retrieval require
      frontally-mediated operations, we hypothesized that A-tDCS to the left prefrontal
      cortex should benefit various operation involved in producing sentences, two of
      which, suppression of the past and planning of the future, were targeted in this 
      study. METHODS: We used a paradigm that elicited construction of sentences
      through event description, but was structured enough to allow for between-subject
      comparison, clear error identification, and implementation of experimental
      manipulations to probe certain aspects of production. RESULTS: We showed that
      A-tDCS to the left PFC reliably decreased the number of incomplete and errorful
      sentences. When the origin of this improvement was probed, we found that A-tDCS
      significantly decreased errors due to premature commitment to the future word
      (insufficient internal monitoring), and had a marginal effect on errors of
      perseverations (insufficient suppression of the past). CONCLUSION: We conclude
      that A-tDCS is a promising tool for improving production at the sentence level,
      and that improvement can be expected when internal monitoring and control over
      verbal responses is impaired, or for certain cases of perseveratory errors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The relation between persistent environmental chemicals and semen
      quality is evolving, although limited data exist for men recruited from general
      populations. OBJECTIVES: We examined the relation between perfluorinated
      chemicals (PFCs) and semen quality among 501 male partners of couples planning
      pregnancy. METHODS: Using population-based sampling strategies, we recruited 501 
      couples discontinuing contraception from two U.S. geographic regions from 2005
      through 2009. Baseline interviews and anthropometric assessments were conducted, 
      followed by blood collection for the quantification of seven serum PFCs
      (perfluorosulfonates, perfluorocarboxylates, and perfluorosulfonamides) using
      tandem mass spectrometry. Men collected a baseline semen sample and another
      approximately 1 month later. Semen samples were shipped with freezer packs, and
      analyses were performed on the day after collection. We used linear regression to
      estimate the difference in each semen parameter associated with a one unit
      increase in the natural log-transformed PFC concentration after adjusting for
      confounders and modeling repeated semen samples. Sensitivity analyses included
      optimal Box-Cox transformation of semen quality end points. RESULTS: Six PFCs
      [2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetate (Me-PFOSA-AcOH),
      perfluorodecanoate (PFDeA), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorooctane
      sulfonamide (PFOSA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorooctanoic acid
      (PFOA)] were associated with 17 semen quality end points before Box-Cox
      transformation. PFOSA was associated with smaller sperm head area and perimeter, 
      a lower percentage of DNA stainability, and a higher percentage of bicephalic and
      immature sperm. PFDeA, PFNA, PFOA, and PFOS were associated with a lower
      percentage of sperm with coiled tails. CONCLUSIONS: Select PFCs were associated
      with certain semen end points, with the most significant associations observed
      for PFOSA but with results in varying directions.

AB  - Conditioned changes in the emotional response to threat (e.g. aversive
      unconditioned stimulus; UCS) are mediated in part by the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
      Unpredictable threats elicit large emotional responses, while the response is
      diminished when the threat is predictable. A better understanding of how PFC
      connectivity to other brain regions varies with threat predictability would
      provide important insights into the neural processes that mediate conditioned
      diminution of the emotional response to threat. The present study examined brain 
      connectivity during predictable and unpredictable threat exposure using a fear
      conditioning paradigm (previously published in Wood et al., 2012) in which
      unconditioned functional magnetic resonance imaging data were reanalyzed to
      assess effective connectivity. Granger causality analysis was performed using the
      time series data from 15 activated regions of interest after hemodynamic
      deconvolution, to determine regional effective connectivity. In addition,
      connectivity path weights were correlated with trait anxiety measures to assess
      the relationship between negative affect and brain connectivity. Results indicate
      the dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) serves as a neural hub that influences activity in
      other brain regions when threats are unpredictable. In contrast, the dorsolateral
      PFC (dlPFC) serves as a neural hub that influences the activity of other brain
      regions when threats are predictable. These findings are consistent with the view
      that the dmPFC coordinates brain activity to take action, perhaps in a reactive
      manner, when an unpredicted threat is encountered, while the dlPFC coordinates
      brain regions to take action, in what may be a more proactive manner, to respond 
      to predictable threats. Further, dlPFC connectivity to other brain regions (e.g. 
      ventromedial PFC, amygdala, and insula) varied with negative affect (i.e. trait
      anxiety) when the UCS was predictable, suggesting that stronger connectivity may 
      be required for emotion regulation in individuals with higher levels of negative 
      affect.

AB  - Chronic stressful stimuli influence disease susceptibility to depression,
      cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. The present work
      investigated antidepressant and antioxidant properties of the aqueous extract
      from Cecropia pachystachya in a mouse model of chronic unpredictable stress
      (CUS). Our results indicated that acute administration of the aqueous extract
      (AE) from C. pachystachya (200 and 400mg/kg, p.o.) produced an
      antidepressant-like effect in the forced swimming test (FST). The chronic
      treatment with C. pachystachya extract (200mg/kg, p.o., for 14 days) prevented
      the depressant-like effect but not the anxiogenic effect induced by CUS. In
      addition to the behavioral modifications, the 14 days of CUS increased lipid
      peroxidation in the hippocampus (HP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), decreased total
      thiol content and glutathione peroxidase activity in the HP. C. pachystachya AE
      administration during CUS protocol was able to prevent the oxidative damage
      induced by stress. However, no changes were observed in the activity of the
      antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase in the above cited brain
      areas after the stress protocol and treatment. Our results suggest that C.
      pachystachya prevented both depressive behavior and oxidative damage induced by
      CUS, supporting its neuroprotective potential against behavioral and biochemical 
      dysfunctions induced by chronic stress.

AB  - Cognitive control allows stimulus-response processing to be aligned with internal
      goals and is thus central to intelligent, purposeful behavior. Control is thought
      to depend in part on the active representation of task information in prefrontal 
      cortex (PFC), which provides a source of contextual bias on perception, decision 
      making, and action. In the present study, we investigated the organization,
      influences, and consequences of context representation as human subjects
      performed a cued sorting task that required them to flexibly judge the
      relationship between pairs of multivalent stimuli. Using a connectivity-based
      parcellation of PFC and multivariate decoding analyses, we determined that
      context is specifically and transiently represented in a region spanning the
      inferior frontal sulcus during context-dependent decision making. We also found
      strong evidence that decision context is represented within the intraparietal
      sulcus, an area previously shown to be functionally networked with the inferior
      frontal sulcus at rest and during task performance. Rule-guided allocation of
      attention to different stimulus dimensions produced discriminable patterns of
      activation in visual cortex, providing a signature of top-down bias over
      perception. Furthermore, demands on cognitive control arising from the task
      structure modulated context representation, which was found to be strongest after
      a shift in task rules. When context representation in frontoparietal areas
      increased in strength, as measured by the discriminability of high-dimensional
      activation patterns, the bias on attended stimulus features was enhanced. These
      results provide novel evidence that illuminates the mechanisms by which humans
      flexibly guide behavior in complex environments.

TI  - Changes in surface topography at the TKA backside articulation following in vivo 
      service: a retrieval analysis.
AB  - PURPOSE: With the advent of modular total knee arthroplasty (TKA) systems,
      backside wear at the articulation between the
      ultra-high-molecular-weight-polyethylene (UHMWPE) component undersurface and the 
      tibial baseplate has received increasing attention as a source of clinically
      significant polyethylene wear debris. The aim of this study was to investigate
      the reciprocating interface at the TKA undersurface articulation using
      profilometry after in vivo service. Our null hypothesis was that there would be
      no discernible pattern or relationship between the metal tibial baseplate and
      UHMWPE surface profile. METHODS: A nanoscale analysis of thirty retrieved
      fixed-bearing TKA explants was performed. Surface roughness (Sa) and skewness
      (Ssk) were measured on both the UHMWPE component undersurface and the tibial
      baseplate of explants using a non-contacting profilometer (1 nm resolution). Four
      pristine unimplanted components of two different designs (Stryker Kinemax and
      DePuy PFC) were examined for control purposes. RESULTS: Mean explant baseplate
      surface roughness was 1.24 mum (0.04-3.01 mum). Mean explant UHMWPE undersurface 
      roughness was 1.16 mum (0.23-2.44 mum). Each explant had an individual roughness 
      pattern with unique baseplate and undersurface UHMWPE surface roughness that was 
      different from, but closely related to, surface topography observed in control
      implants of the same manufacturer and design. Following in vivo service, UHMWPE
      undersurface showed changes towards a negative skewness, demonstrating that wear 
      is occurring at the backside interface. CONCLUSION: In vivo loading of the TKA
      prosthesis leads to measurable changes in surface profile at the backside
      articulation, which appear to be dependent on several factors including implant
      design and in vivo duration. These findings are consistent with wear occurring at
      this surface. Findings of this study would support the use of a polished tibial
      tray over an unpolished design in total knee arthroplasty with the goal of
      reducing PE wear by means of providing a smoother backside countersurface for the
      UHMWPE component.

TI  - Representational similarity of social and valence information in the medial pFC.
PG  - 73-82
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00697 [doi]
AB  - The human brain is remarkably adept at integrating complex information to form
      unified psychological representations of agents, objects, and events in the
      environment. Two domains in which this ability is particularly salient are the
      processing of social and valence information and are supported by common cortical
      areas in the medial pFC (MPFC). Because social information is often embedded
      within valenced emotional contexts, it is possible that activation patterns
      within the MPFC may represent both of these types of cognitive processes when
      presented simultaneously. The current study tested this possibility by employing 
      a large-scale automated meta-analysis tool, together with multivoxel pattern
      analysis to investigate the representational similarity of social and valence
      information in the MPFC during fMRI. Using a representational similarity
      analysis, we found a high degree of representational similarity both within
      social dimensions and within valence dimensions, but not across them (e.g.,
      positive social information was highly dissimilar to negative nonsocial
      information), in a ventral portion of the MPFC. These results were significantly 
      correlated with a behaviorally measured similarity structure of the same stimuli,
      suggesting that a psychologically meaningful representation of social and valence
      information is reflected by multivoxel activation patterns in the ventral MPFC.

AB  - Chronic cocaine exposure in both human addicts and in rodent models of addiction 
      reduces prefrontal cortical activity, which subsequently dysregulates reward
      processing and higher order executive function. The net effect of this impaired
      gating of behavior is enhanced vulnerability to relapse. Previously we have shown
      that cocaine-induced increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
      expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a neuroadaptive mechanism
      that blunts the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine. As BDNF is known to affect
      neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity, we tested the hypothesis that
      abstinence from cocaine self-administration would lead to alterations in neuronal
      morphology and synaptic density in the PFC. Using a novel technique, array
      tomography and Golgi staining, morphological changes in the rat PFC were analyzed
      following 14 days of cocaine self-administration and 7 days of forced abstinence.
      Our results indicate that overall dendritic branching and total synaptic density 
      are significantly reduced in the rat PFC. In contrast, the density of thin
      dendritic spines are significantly increased on layer V pyramidal neurons of the 
      PFC. These findings indicate that dynamic structural changes occur during cocaine
      abstinence that may contribute to the observed hypo-activity of the PFC in
      cocaine-addicted individuals.

TI  - MK-801-induced behavioural sensitisation alters dopamine release and turnover in 
      rat prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 509-17
LID - 10.1007/s00213-014-3689-9 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Repeated exposure to psychostimulants that either increase dopamine
      (DA) release or target N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors can induce
      behavioural sensitisation, a phenomenon that may be important for the processes
      of addiction and even psychosis. A critical component of behavioural
      sensitisation is an increase in DA release within mesocorticolimbic circuits. In 
      particular, sensitisation to amphetamine leads to increased DA release within
      well-known sub-cortical brain regions and also regulatory regions such as
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, it is unknown how DA release within the PFC of 
      animals is altered by sensitisation to NMDA receptor antagonists. OBJECTIVES: The
      aims of the present study were twofold, firstly to examine whether a single dose 
      of dizocilpine maleate (MK-801) could induce long-term behavioural sensitisation 
      and secondly to examine DA release in the PFC of sensitised rats. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Behavioural sensitisation was assessed by measuring locomotion after
      drug exposure. DA release in the PFC was measured using freely moving
      microdialysis. RESULTS: We show that a single dose of MK-801 can induce
      sensitisation to subsequent MK-801 exposure in a high percentage of rats (66 %). 
      Furthermore, rats sensitised to MK-801 have altered DA release and turnover in
      the PFC compared with non-sensitised rats. CONCLUSION: Schizophrenia patients
      have been postulated to have 'endogenous sensitisation' to psychostimulants.
      MK-801-induced sensitised rats, in particular when compared with non-sensitised
      rats, provide a useful model for studying PFC dysfunction in schizophrenia.

AB  - In the present study, we investigated the effects of chronic exposure (14 and 28 
      days) to a 50 Hz, 0.5 mT extremely low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) on the
      NMDAR and AMPAR subunit expressions and rat spatial learning and memory. Using
      the Western blotting method, we found ELF-MF exposure specifically decreased the 
      expressions of GluA2 in the EC post 28 day exposure and GluA3 of AMPAR subunits
      in the PFC after 14 day exposure, while it did not affect the AMPAR subunit
      expression in the hippocampus at both time points. As for NMDAR subunits, 14 day 
      ELF-MF exposure significantly increased the levels of GluN2A and GluN2B in the
      hippocampus. Moreover, the levels of GluN1 and GluN2A were enhanced in the EC and
      PFC after two weeks of ELF-MF exposure. Interestingly, 28 day ELF-MF exposure
      induced a different expression pattern for NMDAR subunits. The increased GluN2A
      expression observed at 14 day post ELF-MF exposure was recovered after prolonged 
      exposure in the hippocampus and PFC. In the EC, the increased expression of GluN1
      achieved to control level and, specifically, a decrease in GluN2A level was
      observed. Surprisingly, neither 14 nor 28 day ELF-MF did affect the rat spatial
      reference memory as assessed by water maze. These results indicate that the
      dynamic and brain-region specific changes in ionotropic glutamate receptor
      expression induced by ELF-MF are insufficient to influence the rat spatial
      learning ability.

AB  - The glutamatergic predominance in the excitatory-inhibitory balance is postulated
      to be involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Such imbalance may be induced
      by astrocyte ablation which reduces glutamate uptake and increases glutamate
      level in the synaptic cleft. In the present study, we tried to ascertain whether 
      astroglial degeneration in the prefrontal cortex could serve as an animal model
      of depression and whether inhibition of glutamatergic transmission by the mGluR5 
      antagonist MTEP could have antidepressant potential. Astrocytic toxins l-or
      dl-alpha-aminoadipic acid (AAA), 100mug/2mul, were microinjected, bilaterally
      into the rat medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) on the first and second day of
      experiment. MTEP (10mg/kg) or imipramine (30mg/kg) were administered on the fifth
      day. Following administration of MTEP or imipramine the forced swim test (FST)
      was performed for assessment of depressive-like behavior. The brains were taken
      out for analysis on day eight. The astrocytic marker, glial fibrillary acidic
      protein (GFAP) was quantified in PFC by Western blot method and by stereological 
      counting of immunohistochemically stained sections. Both l-AAA and dl-AAA induced
      a significant increase in immobility time in the FST. This effect was reversed by
      imipramine, which indicates depressive-like effects of these toxins. A
      significant decrease in GFAP (about 50%) was found after l-AAA. Both the
      behavioral and GFAP level changes were prevented by MTEP injection. The obtained 
      results indicate that the degeneration of astrocytes in the PFC by l-AAA may be a
      useful animal model of depression and suggest antidepressant potential of MTEP.

LID - 10.1111/acps.12314 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Explore interrelationships between suicide attempt history (Objective 
      1) or suicide attempt severity (Objective 2) with prefrontal cortex gray matter
      (PFCGM ) volume and illness-course in patients with bipolar disorder (BD).
      METHOD: Ninety-three women with BD-I or -II diagnosis (51 with and 42 without
      suicide attempt history) underwent structural MRI and filled out questionnaires. 
      Measured were GM volumes of 11 PFC regions, BD illness-course, and attempt
      history and severity. Effects were examined with repeated measures GLM or logit
      analyses. RESULTS: Objective 1: Attempt history was associated with increased
      trait impulsivity and aggression, and higher prevalence of BD-I, past drug use
      disorder, and past psychiatric hospitalization. PFCGM volume was lower in
      patients with than without attempt history in those with past psychiatric
      hospitalization. PFCGM volume was higher in patients with than without attempt
      history in those without hospitalization. Higher trait aggression predicted
      attempt history. Objective 2: Increased frontal pole volume and younger age at
      first hospitalization predicted many suicide attempts. CONCLUSION: Attempt
      history in patients with BD related to PFCGM volume reduction or increase. Volume
      modulation by psychiatric hospitalization could reflect effects of illness-course
      or care. Attempt severity was not related to volume reduction. Research on
      suicidality-brain relationships should include illness-course and attempt
      severity measures.

TI  - Smoking cessation induced by deep repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of
      the prefrontal and insular cortices: a prospective, randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in
      developed countries. Our previous studies in animal models and humans suggest
      that repeated activation of cue-induced craving networks followed by
      electromagnetic stimulation of the dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC) can cause
      lasting reductions in drug craving and consumption. We hypothesized that
      disruption of these circuitries by deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
      of the PFC and insula bilaterally can induce smoking cessation. METHODS: Adults
      (N = 115) who smoke at least 20 cigarettes/day and failed previous treatments
      were recruited from the general population. Participants were randomized to
      receive 13 daily sessions of high-frequency, low-frequency or sham stimulation
      following, or without, presentation of smoking cues. Deep TMS was administered
      using an H-coil version targeting the lateral PFC and insula bilaterally.
      Cigarette consumption was evaluated during the treatment by measuring cotinine
      levels in urine samples and recording participants' self-reports as a primary
      outcome variable. Dependence and craving were assessed using standardized
      questionnaires. RESULTS: High (but not low) frequency deep TMS treatment
      significantly reduced cigarette consumption and nicotine dependence. The
      combination of this treatment with exposure to smoking cues enhanced reduction in
      cigarette consumption leading to an abstinence rate of 44% at the end of the
      treatment and an estimated 33% 6 months following the treatment. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study further implicates the lateral PFC and insula in nicotine addiction
      and suggests the use of deep high-frequency TMS of these regions following
      presentation of smoking cues as a promising treatment strategy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The neurobiological basis of action of noncompetitive
      N-methyl-D-aspartate acid receptor (NMDA-R) antagonists is poorly understood.
      Electrophysiological studies indicate that phencyclidine (PCP) markedly disrupts 
      neuronal activity with an overall excitatory effect and reduces the power of
      low-frequency oscillations (LFO; <4 Hz) in thalamocortical networks. Because the 
      reticular nucleus of the thalamus (RtN) provides tonic feed-forward inhibition to
      the rest of the thalamic nuclei, we examined the effect of PCP on RtN activity,
      under the working hypothesis that NMDA-R blockade in RtN would disinhibit
      thalamocortical networks. METHODS: Drug effects (PCP followed by clozapine) on
      the activity of RtN (single unit and local field potential recordings) and
      prefrontal cortex (PFC; electrocorticogram) in anesthetized rats were assessed.
      RESULTS: PCP (.25-.5 mg/kg, intravenous) reduced the discharge rate of 19 of 21
      RtN neurons to 37% of baseline (p < .000001) and the power of LFO in RtN and PFC 
      to ~20% of baseline (p < .001). PCP also reduced the coherence between PFC and
      RtN in the LFO range. A low clozapine dose (1 mg/kg intravenous) significantly
      countered the effect of PCP on LFO in PFC but not in RtN and further reduced the 
      discharge rate of RtN neurons. However, clozapine administration partly
      antagonized the fall in coherence and phase-locking values produced by PCP.
      CONCLUSIONS: PCP activates thalamocortical circuits in a bottom-up manner by
      reducing the activity of RtN neurons, which tonically inhibit thalamic relay
      neurons. However, clozapine reversal of PCP effects is not driven by restoring
      RtN activity and may involve a cortical action.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors
      that act as ligand-activated transcription factors. Although prescribed for
      dyslipidemia and type-II diabetes, PPAR agonists also possess anti-addictive
      characteristics. PPAR agonists decrease ethanol consumption and reduce withdrawal
      severity and susceptibility to stress-induced relapse in rodents. However, the
      cellular and molecular mechanisms facilitating these properties have yet to be
      investigated. We tested three PPAR agonists in a continuous access two-bottle
      choice (2BC) drinking paradigm and found that tesaglitazar (PPARalpha/gamma; 1.5 
      mg/kg) and fenofibrate (PPARalpha; 150 mg/kg) decreased ethanol consumption in
      male C57BL/6J mice while bezafibrate (PPARalpha/gamma/beta; 75 mg/kg) did not. We
      hypothesized that changes in brain gene expression following fenofibrate and
      tesaglitazar treatment lead to reduced ethanol drinking. We studied unbiased
      genomic profiles in areas of the brain known to be important for ethanol
      dependence, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala, and also profiled gene
      expression in liver. Genomic profiles from the non-effective bezafibrate
      treatment were used to filter out genes not associated with ethanol consumption. 
      Because PPAR agonists are anti-inflammatory, they would be expected to target
      microglia and astrocytes. Surprisingly, PPAR agonists produced a strong neuronal 
      signature in mouse brain, and fenofibrate and tesaglitazar (but not bezafibrate) 
      targeted a subset of GABAergic interneurons in the amygdala. Weighted gene
      co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed co-expression of
      treatment-significant genes. Functional annotation of these gene networks
      suggested that PPAR agonists might act via neuropeptide and dopaminergic
      signaling pathways in the amygdala. Our results reveal gene targets through which
      PPAR agonists can affect alcohol consumption behavior.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating disease with symptoms like
      persistent depressed mood and sleep disturbances. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has
      been implicated as an important structure in the neural circuitry of MDD, with
      pronounced abnormalities in blood flow and metabolic activity in PFC subregions, 
      including the subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC, or Brodmann area 25). In
      addition, deep brain stimulation in the sgACC has recently been shown to
      alleviate treatment-resistant depression. Depressed patients also show
      characteristic changes in sleep: insomnia, increased rapid-eye-movement (REM)
      sleep and shortened REM sleep latency. We hypothesized that sleep changes and
      depressive behavior may be a consequence of the abnormal PFC activity in MDD. The
      rat ventromedial PFC (vmPFC, prelimbic and infralimbic cortices) is considered to
      be the homolog of the human sgACC, so we examined the effect of excitotic lesions
      in the vmPFC on sleep-wake and depressive behavior. We also made lesions in the
      adjacent dorsal region (dmPFC) to compare the effect of this similar but distinct
      mPFC region. We found that both dmPFC and vmPFC lesions led to increased REM
      sleep, but only vmPFC-lesioned animals displayed increased sleep fragmentation,
      shortened REM latency and increased immobility in the forced swim test. Anatomic 
      tracing suggests that the mPFC projects to the pontine REM-off neurons that
      interact with REM-on neurons in the dorsal pons. These results support our
      hypothesis that neuronal loss in the rat vmPFC resembles several characteristics 
      of MDD and may be a critical area for modulating both mood and sleep.

AB  - The ability to inhibit prepotent responses is critical for successful
      goal-directed behaviors. To investigate the neural basis of inhibitory control,
      we conducted a magnetoencephalography study where human participants performed
      the antisaccade task. Results indicated that neural oscillations in the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) showed significant task modulations in preparation to
      suppress saccades. Before successfully inhibiting a saccade, beta-band power
      (18-38 Hz) in the lateral PFC and alpha-band power (10-18 Hz) in the frontal eye 
      field (FEF) increased. Trial-by-trial prestimulus FEF alpha-band power predicted 
      successful saccadic inhibition. Further, inhibitory control enhanced
      cross-frequency amplitude coupling between PFC beta-band (18-38 Hz) activity and 
      FEF alpha-band activity, and the coupling appeared to be initiated by the PFC.
      Our results suggest a generalized mechanism for top-down inhibitory control:
      prefrontal beta-band activity initiates alpha-band activity for functional
      inhibition of the effector and/or sensory system.

TI  - Exposure to mission relevant doses of 1 GeV/Nucleon (56)Fe particles leads to
      impairment of attentional set-shifting performance in socially mature rats.
PG  - 292-8
LID - 10.1667/RR3766.1 [doi]
AB  - Previous ground-based experiments have shown that cranial irradiation with
      mission relevant (20 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles leads to a
      significant impairment in Attentional Set Shifting (ATSET) performance, a measure
      of executive function, in juvenile Wistar rats. However, the use of head only
      radiation exposure and the biological age of the rats used in that study may not 
      be pertinent to determine the likelihood that ATSET will be impaired in
      Astronauts on deep space flights. In this study we have determined the impact
      that whole-body exposure to 10, 15 and 20 cGy of 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles
      had on the ability (at three months post exposure) of socially mature (retired
      breeder) Wistar rats to conduct the attentional set-shifting paradigm. The
      current study has established that whole-body exposures to 15 and 20 (but not 10)
      cGy of 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles results in the impairment of ATSET in both 
      juvenile and socially mature rats. However, the exact nature of the impaired
      ATSET performance varied depending upon the age of the rats, whether whole-body
      versus cranial irradiation was used and the dose of 1 GeV/u (56)Fe received.
      Exposure of juvenile rats to 20 cGy of 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles led to a
      decreased ability to perform intra-dimensional shifting (IDS) irrespective of
      whether the rats received head only or whole-body exposures. Juvenile rats that
      received whole-body exposure also had a reduced ability to habituate to the assay
      and to complete intra-dimensional shifting reversal (IDR), whereas juvenile rats 
      that received head only exposure had a reduced ability to complete compound
      discrimination reversal (CDR). Socially mature rats that received whole-body
      exposures to 10 cGy of 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles exhibited no obvious
      decline in set-shifting performance; however those exposed to 15 and 20 cGy had a
      reduced ability to perform simple discrimination (SD) and compound discrimination
      (CD). Exposure to 20 cGy of 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles also led to a
      decreased performance in IDR and to approximately 25% of rats failing to
      habituate to the task. Most of these rats started to dig for the food reward but 
      rapidly (within 15 s) gave up digging, suggesting that they had developed
      appropriate procedural memories about food retrieval, but had an inability to
      maintain attention on the task. Our preliminary data suggests that whole-body
      exposure to 20 cGy of 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles reduced the cholinergic (but
      not the GABAergic) readily releasable pool (RRP) in nerve terminals of the basal 
      forebrain from socially-mature rats. This perturbation of the cholinergic RRP
      could directly lead to the loss of CDR and IDR performance, and indirectly
      [through the metabolic changes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)] to the
      loss of SD and CD performance. These findings provide the first evidence that
      attentional set-shifting performance in socially mature rats is impaired after
      whole-body exposure to mission relevant doses (15 and 20 cGy) of 1 GeV/nucleon
      (56)Fe particles, and importantly that a dose reduction down to 10 cGy prevents
      that impairment. The ability to conduct Discrimination tasks (SD and CD) and
      reversal learning (CDR) is reduced after exposure to 15 and 20 cGy of 1
      GeV/nucleon (56)Fe particles, but at 20 cGy there is an additional decrement,
      approximately 25% of rats are unable to maintain attention to task. These
      behavioral decrements are associated with a reduction in the cholinergic RRP
      within basal forebrain, which has been shown to play a major role in regulating
      the activity of the PFC.

TI  - Altered regulation of protein kinase a activity in the medial prefrontal cortex
      of normal and brain-injured animals actively engaged in a working memory task.
PG  - 139-48
LID - 10.1089/neu.2014.3487 [doi]
AB  - Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling 
      is required for short- and long-term memory. In contrast, enhanced PKA activity
      has been shown to impair working memory, a prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent,
      transient form of memory critical for cognition and goal-directed behaviors.
      Working memory can be impaired after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the absence 
      of overt damage to the PFC. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute
      to this deficit are largely unknown. In the present study, we examined whether
      altered PKA signaling in the PFC as a result of TBI is a contributing mechanism. 
      We measured PKA activity in medial PFC (mPFC) tissue homogenates prepared from
      sham and 14-day postinjury rats. PKA activity was measured both when animals were
      inactive and when actively engaged in a spatial working memory task. Our results 
      demonstrate, for the first time, that PKA activity in the mPFC is actively
      suppressed in uninjured animals performing a working memory task. By comparison, 
      both basal and working memory-related PKA activity was elevated in TBI animals.
      Inhibition of PKA activity by intra-mPFC administration of Rp-cAMPS into TBI
      animals had no influence on working memory performance 30 min postinfusion, but
      significantly improved working memory when tested 24 h later. This improvement
      was associated with reduced glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 messenger RNA levels. 
      Taken together, these results suggest that TBI-associated working memory
      dysfunction may result, in part, from enhanced PKA activity, possibly leading to 
      altered expression of plasticity-related genes in the mPFC.

TI  - Antidepressant-like activity of magnesium in the olfactory bulbectomy model is
      associated with the AMPA/BDNF pathway.
PG  - 355-67
LID - 10.1007/s00213-014-3671-6 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Numerous studies suggest agents that act on glutamatergic transmission
      as potential antidepressants. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that
      magnesium, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blocker, may be useful in the
      treatment of depression. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      effects of magnesium on behavior; protein levels of GluN2A, GluN2B
      [N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits], GluA1 [alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5 
      methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) subunit], phospho-Ser-831-GluA1 (P-S831),
      phospho-Ser-845-GluA1 (P-S845), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); and
      messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of GluN2A and GluN2B in different brain areas in the 
      olfactory bulbectomy (OB) model of depression in rats. METHODS: Magnesium was
      administered once daily for 14 days at three doses (10, 15, and 20 mg/kg,
      intraperitoneal) to sham and OB rats. Following treatment, open field and passive
      avoidance tests were performed in the sham and OB rats. After 24 h, the
      hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the amygdala of rats treated with
      the most active dose (15 mg/kg) were harvested, and the protein and mRNA levels
      were determined. RESULTS: Chronic administration of magnesium (15 and 20 mg/kg)
      reduced the number of trials required to learn passive avoidance and reduced the 
      OB-induced hyperactivity. OB increased the P-S845 level in the hippocampus, which
      was reduced by magnesium treatment. Magnesium significantly increased the levels 
      of BDNF, GluN2B, P-S831, and P-S845 protein (and mRNA) primarily in the PFC and
      the hippocampus in OB rats. CONCLUSION: For the first time, the present results
      demonstrate the antidepressant-like activity of magnesium in the OB animal model 
      of depression and indicate the potential involvement of the AMPA/BDNF pathway in 
      this activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a prevalent anxiety disorder,
      but its neurobiological basis has been poorly studied. A few cognitive models
      have been proposed for understanding GAD development and maintenance. The aim of 
      this study is to review functional Magnetic Resonance Image (fMRI) studies
      conducted with GAD patients and evaluate if they support and underpin the
      theoretical cognitive models proposed for this anxiety disorder. METHODS: A
      literature systematic review was undertaken in PubMed and ISI databases with no
      time limits. RESULTS: From the studies included in this review, 10 explored the
      "emotional dysregulation model", showing, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC) hypofunction and deficient top-down control system during 
      emotion regulation tasks, despite conflicting techniques and results. Only one
      study explored the "conditioned fear overgeneralization theory", other the
      "intolerance of uncertainty model" and two studies were unspecific (worry
      induction tasks). Between those, there were 4 studies evaluating pre- and
      post-treatment with antidepressants or "mindfulness". LIMITATIONS: The studies
      methodologies differ between one another making it difficult to identify a common
      finding. CONCLUSION: Emotion dysregulation seems to be an important cognitive
      dysfunction in GAD patients and fMRI studies suggest that it is related to PFC
      and ACC hypofunction as well as a deficient cortex-amygdala functional
      connectivity.

AB  - Two essential elements required to generate a glass transition within
      phase-field-crystal (PFC) models are outlined based on observed freezing
      behaviors in various models of this class. The central dynamic features of glass 
      formation in simple binary liquids are qualitatively reproduced across 12 orders 
      of magnitude in time by applying a physically motivated time scaling to previous 
      PFC simulation results. New aspects of the equilibrium phase behavior of the same
      binary model system are also outlined, aging behavior is explored in the moderate
      and deeply supercooled regimes, and aging exponents are extracted. General
      features of the elastic and plastic responses of amorphous and crystalline PFC
      solids under deformation are also compared and contrasted.

TI  - [Role of catecholamine hormone in heroin addicts].
PG  - 124-6, 131
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of catecholamine hormone on the blood and
      brain of heroin addicts. METHODS: Rats were divided into three groups and treated
      with the glucose (control group), the heroin (im) (heroin group), and the
      combination of the intramuscular injection of reserpine and heroin (reserpine
      group). Changes in the levels of the dopamine (DA), cAMP, and cGMP were detected 
      by the radioimmunoassay (RIA) method in the blood and brain tissue. RESULTS: No
      significant withdrawal symptoms were observed in the reserpine group. Compared
      with the control and heroin groups, the blood cAMP levels were increased by
      35.36% and 15.53% in the reserpine group, respectively; the cAMP levels in the
      midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hippocampus
      (Hipp) were increased by 24.08% & 8.53%, 15.66% & 8.13%, and 21.95% & 8.40%,
      respectively. While compared to the control and heroin groups, the DA levels of
      the PFC, Hipp, striatum, and nucleus accumbens (NAc) were significantly reduced
      in the reserpine group, decreasing by 74.09% & 82.86%, 81.06% & 82.23%, 91.62% & 
      86.55% and 84.35% & 90.63%, respectively. The concentrations of cGMP of the brain
      tissues in the reserpine group were lower than those in the control group. In
      addition, the neural electrophysiological testing showed that the
      electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and muscle spindle discharge
      diagram of rats in both the reserpine and heroin groups were apparently changed. 
      CONCLUSION: Catecholamine hormone plays an important role in heroin addiction.

TI  - Transpulmonary hypothermia: a novel method of rapid brain cooling through
      augmented heat extraction from the lungs.

AB  - AIM: Delay in instituting neuroprotective measures after cardiac arrest increases
      death and decreases neuronal recovery. Current hypothermia methods are slow,
      ineffective, unreliable, or highly invasive. We report the feasibility of rapid
      hypothermia induction in swine through augmented heat extraction from the lungs. 
      METHODS: Twenty-four domestic crossbred pigs (weight, 50-55kg) were ventilated
      with room air. Intraparenchymal brain temperature and core temperatures from
      pulmonary artery, lower esophagus, bladder, rectum, nasopharynx, and tympanum
      were recorded. In eight animals, ventilation was switched to cooled helium-oxygen
      mixture (heliox) and perfluorocarbon (PFC) aerosol and continued for 90min or
      until target brain temperature of 32 degrees C was reached. Eight animals
      received body-surface cooling with water-circulating blankets; eight control
      animals continued to be ventilated with room air. RESULTS: Brain and core
      temperatures declined rapidly with cooled heliox-PFC ventilation. The brain
      reached target temperature within the study period (mean [SD], 66 [7.6]min) in
      only the transpulmonary cooling group. Cardiopulmonary functions and poststudy
      histopathological examination of the lungs were normal. CONCLUSION:
      Transpulmonary cooling is novel, rapid, minimally invasive, and an effective
      technique to induce therapeutic hypothermia. High thermal conductivity of helium 
      and vaporization of PFC produces rapid cooling of alveolar gases. The thinness
      and large surface area of alveolar membrane facilitate rapid cooling of the
      pulmonary circulation. Because of differences in thermogenesis, blood flow,
      insulation, and exposure to the external environment, the brain cools at a
      different rate than other organs. Transpulmonary hypothermia was significantly
      faster than body surface cooling in reaching target brain temperature.

TI  - Effects of perfluorocarbon dodecafluoropentane (NVX-108) on cerebral
      microvasculature in the healthy rat.
PG  - 220-6
AB  - NVX-108, a dodecafluoropentane-based perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsion, has
      therapeutic potential as an oxygen- carrying fluid for emergency medical
      treatment for traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hemorrhagic shock. Potential
      cerebral vasoactive properties were assessed by directly measuring pial
      arteriolar vessel diameters before and after a 30 minute intravenous (IV)
      infusion of 1.0 ml/kg (high dose [H]) or 0.25 ml/kg (low dose [L]) NVX-108
      compared to 2.0 ml/kg Saline (control) in healthy anesthetized rats (N =
      6/group). Results showed that post-infusion vessel diameters for small (< 50
      microm) and medium (50-100 microm)-sized pial arterioles were significantly (p < 
      0.05) narrower after only the NVX- 108 H infusion although this vasoconstriction 
      was not statistically significant when analyzed as a percentage change in these
      vessels. Pial arteriolar vessel diameters were not significantly different for
      mean value or percentage change after either NVX-108 L or Saline infusions. There
      were no significant post-infusion changes from baseline in systolic, mean or
      diastolic blood pressures after any of the treatments although post-infusion
      blood pressure was statistically higher in the NVX-108 L group compared to
      NVX-108 H and Saline groups. Arterial blood gases, methemoglob in and lactate
      were not different from baseline or among groups. No adverse events were observed
      at either dose of NVX-108. In conclusion, neither 0.25 nor 1.0 ml/kg NVX-108
      caused vasoconstriction in cerebral pial arterioles of healthy rats nor resulted 
      in blood pressure changes; the compound should be considered for further
      investigation for TBI therapy.

AB  - Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) have been shown to disrupt lipid metabolism and
      even induce cancer in rodents through activation of peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Lines of evidence showed that PPARalpha
      was activated by PFCs. However, the information on the binding interactions
      between PPARgamma and PFCs and subsequent alteration of PPARgamma activity is
      still limited and sometimes inconsistent. In the present study, in vitro binding 
      of 16 PFCs to human PPARgamma ligand binding domain (hPPARgamma-LBD) and their
      activity on the receptor in cells were investigated. The results showed that the 
      binding affinity was strongly dependent on their carbon number and functional
      group. For the eleven perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs), the binding
      affinity increased with their carbon number from 4 to 11, and then decreased
      slightly. The binding affinity of the three perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs)
      was stronger than their PFCA counterparts. No binding was detected for the two
      fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs). Circular dichroim spectroscopy showed that PFC
      binding induced distinctive structural change of the receptor. In dual luciferase
      reporter assays using transiently transfected Hep G2 cells, PFCs acted as
      hPPARgamma agonists, and their potency correlated with their binding affinity
      with hPPARgamma-LBD. Molecular docking showed that PFCs with different chain
      length bind with the receptor in different geometry, which may contribute to
      their differences in binding affinity and transcriptional activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most prevalent
      mental disorders in the elderly, but its functional neuroanatomy is not well
      understood. Given the role of emotion dysregulation in GAD, we sought to describe
      the neural bases of emotion regulation in late-life GAD by analyzing the
      functional connectivity (FC) in the Salience Network and the Executive Control
      Network during worry induction and worry reappraisal. METHODS: The study included
      28 elderly GAD and 31 non-anxious comparison participants. Twelve elderly GAD
      completed a 12-week pharmacotherapy trial. We used an in-scanner worry script
      that alternates blocks of worry induction and reappraisal. We assessed network
      FC, using the following seeds: anterior insula (AI), dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (dlPFC), the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), and the
      paraventricular nucleus (PVN). RESULTS: GAD participants exhibited greater FC
      during worry induction between the left AI and the right orbitofrontal cortex,
      and between the BNST and the subgenual cingulate. During worry reappraisal, the
      non-anxious participants had greater FC between the left dlPFC and the medial
      PFC, as well as between the left AI and the medial PFC, and elderly GAD patients 
      had greater FC between the PVN and the amygdala. Following 12 weeks of
      pharmacotherapy, GAD participants had greater connectivity between the dlPFC and 
      several prefrontal regions during worry reappraisal. CONCLUSION: FC during worry 
      induction and reappraisal points toward abnormalities in both worry generation
      and worry reappraisal. Following successful pharmacologic treatment, we observed 
      greater connectivity in the prefrontal nodes of the Executive Control Network
      during reappraisal of worry.

AB  - Concerns regarding perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) have risen in recent years
      because of their ubiquitous presence and high persistency. However, data on the
      environmental impacts of PFCs on marine organisms are very limited. Oxidative
      toxicity has been suggested to be one of the major toxic pathways for PFCs to
      induce adverse effects on organisms. To investigate PFC-induced oxidative stress 
      and oxidative toxicity, a series of antioxidant enzyme activities and oxidative
      damage biomarkers were examined to assess the adverse effects of the following 4 
      commonly detected compounds: perfluoro-octanesulfonate, perfluoro-ocanoic acid,
      perfluorononanoic acid, and perfluorodecanoic acid, on green mussel (Perna
      viridis). Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were also
      established. The results showed that all the tested PFCs are able to induce
      antioxidant response and oxidative damage on green mussels in a dose-dependent
      manner. At low exposure levels (0 microg/L-100 microg/L), activation of
      antioxidant enzymes (catalase [CAT] and superoxide dismutase [SOD]) was observed,
      which is an adaptive response to the excessive reactive oxygen species induced by
      PFCs, while at high exposure levels (100 microg/L-10 000 microg/L), PFCs were
      found to inhibit some enzyme activity (glutathione S-transferase and SOD) where
      the organism's ability to respond in an adaptive manner was compromised. The
      oxidative stress under high PFC exposure concentration also led to lipid and DNA 
      damage. PFC-induced oxidative toxicity was found to be correlated with the
      bioaccumulation potential of PFCs. Based on this relationship, QSAR models were
      established using the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) as the molecular descriptor
      for the first time. Compared with previous octanol-water partition
      coefficient-dependent QSAR models, the BAF-dependent QSAR model is more suitable 
      for the impact assessment of PFCs and thus provides a more accurate description
      of the toxic behavior of these compounds.

      increases cortical excitability and impairs motor learning.
PG  - 201

AB  - The dopaminergic system is involved in learning and participates in the
      modulation of cortical excitability (CE). CE has been suggested as a marker of
      learning and use-dependent plasticity. However, results from separate studies on 
      either motor CE or motor learning challenge this notion, suggesting opposing
      effects of dopaminergic modulation upon these parameters: while agonists decrease
      and antagonists increase CE, motor learning is enhanced by agonists and disturbed
      by antagonists. To examine whether this discrepancy persists when complex motor
      learning and motor CE are measured in the same experimental setup, we
      investigated the effects of dopaminergic (DA) antagonism upon both parameters and
      upon task-associated brain activation. Our results demonstrate that DA-antagonism
      has opposing effects upon motor CE and motor sequence learning. Tiapride did not 
      alter baseline CE, but increased CE post training of a complex motor sequence
      while simultaneously impairing motor learning. Moreover, tiapride reduced
      activation in several brain regions associated with motor sequence performance,
      i.e., dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), supplementary motor area (SMA), Broca's area,
      cingulate and caudate body. Blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) intensity in
      anterior cingulate and caudate body, but not CE, correlated with performance
      across groups. In summary, our results do not support a concept of CE as a
      general marker of motor learning, since they demonstrate that a straightforward
      relation of increased CE and higher learning success does not apply to all
      instances of motor learning. At least for complex motor tasks that recruit a
      network of brain regions outside motor cortex, CE in primary motor cortex is
      probably no central determinant for learning success.

      in the prefrontal cortex in schizoaffective disorder but not schizophrenia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling in the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) has been associated with cognitive dysfunction in patients with
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Levels of the GABA-synthesizing
      enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 67-kDa isoform (GAD67) in the PFC have been
      consistently reported to be lower in patients with these disorders, but the
      status of the second GABA-synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65-kDa
      isoform (GAD65), remains unclear. METHODS: GAD65 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were
      quantified in PFC area 9 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction from 62
      subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 62 matched healthy
      comparison subjects. In a subset of subject pairs, GAD65 relative protein levels 
      were quantified by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Mean GAD65
      mRNA levels were 13.6% lower in subjects with schizoaffective disorder but did
      not differ in subjects with schizophrenia relative to their matched healthy
      comparison subjects. In the subjects with schizoaffective disorder, mean GAD65
      protein levels were 19.4% lower and were correlated with GAD65 mRNA levels. Lower
      GAD65 mRNA and protein levels within subjects with schizoaffective disorder were 
      not attributable to factors commonly comorbid with the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In
      concert with previous studies, these findings suggest that schizoaffective
      disorder is associated with lower levels of both GAD65 and GAD67 mRNA and protein
      in the PFC, whereas subjects with schizophrenia have lower mean levels of only
      GAD67 mRNA and protein. Because cognitive function is generally better preserved 
      in patients with schizoaffective disorder relative to patients with
      schizophrenia, these findings may support an interpretation that GAD65
      downregulation provides a homeostatic response complementary to GAD67
      downregulation that serves to reduce inhibition in the face of lower PFC network 
      activity.

AB  - The mesocortical dopaminergic pathway projecting from the ventral tegmental area 
      (VTA) to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) contributes to the processing of reward
      signals. This pathway is regulated by gonadal steroids including estradiol. To
      address the putative role of estradiol and isotype-selective estrogen receptor
      (ER) agonists in the regulation of the rodent mesocortical system, we combined
      fMRI, HPLC-MS and qRT-PCR techniques. In fMRI experiments adult, chronically
      ovariectomized rats, treated with either vehicle, estradiol, ERalpha agonist
      16alpha-lactone-estradiol (LE2) or ERbeta agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN),
      received a single dose of d-amphetamine-sulphate (10mg/kg, i.p.) and BOLD
      responses were monitored in the VTA and the PFC. Ovariectomized rats showed no
      significant response to amphetamine. In contrast, the VTA of ER
      agonist-substituted ovariectomized rats showed robust amphetamine-evoked BOLD
      increases. The PFC of estradiol-replaced animals was also responsive to
      amphetamine. Mass spectroscopic analysis of dopamine and its metabolites revealed
      a two-fold increase in both dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid content
      of the PFC in estradiol-replaced animals compared to ovariectomized controls.
      qRT-PCR studies revealed upregulation of dopamine transporter and dopamine
      receptor in the VTA and PFC, respectively, of ER agonist-treated ovariectomized
      animals. Collectively, the results indicate that E2 and isotype-selective ER
      agonists can powerfully modulate the responsiveness of the mesocortical
      dopaminergic system, increase the expression of key genes related to dopaminergic
      neurotransmission and augment the dopamine content of the PFC. In a broader
      sense, the findings support the concept that the manifestation of reward signals 
      in the PFC is dependent on the actual estrogen milieu of the brain.

TI  - Developmental topographical disorientation and decreased hippocampal functional
      connectivity.
PG  - 1364-74
LID - 10.1002/hipo.22317 [doi]
AB  - Developmental topographical disorientation (DTD) is a newly discovered cognitive 
      disorder in which individuals experience a lifelong history of getting lost in
      both novel and familiar surroundings. Recent studies have shown that such a
      selective orientation defect relies primarily on the inability of the individuals
      to form cognitive maps, i.e., mental representations of the surrounding that
      allow individuals to get anywhere from any location in the environment, although 
      other orientation skills are additionally affected. To date, the neural
      correlates of this developmental condition are unknown. Here, we tested the
      hypothesis that DTD may be related to ineffective functional connectivity between
      the hippocampus (HC; known to be critical for cognitive maps) and other brain
      regions critical for spatial orientation. A group of individuals with DTD and a
      group of control subjects underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (rsfMRI) scan. In addition, we performed voxel-based morphometry to
      investigate potential structural differences between individuals with DTD and
      controls. The results of the rsfMRI study revealed a decreased functional
      connectivity between the right HC and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in individuals 
      with DTD. No structural differences were detected between groups. These findings 
      provide evidence that ineffective functional connectivity between HC and PFC may 
      affect the monitoring and processing of spatial information while moving within
      an environment, resulting in the lifelong selective inability of individuals with
      DTD to form cognitive maps that are critical for orienting in both familiar and
      unfamiliar surroundings.

TI  - Dopamine modulation of GABAergic function enables network stability and input
      selectivity for sustaining working memory in a computational model of the
      prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 3067-76
LID - 10.1038/npp.2014.160 [doi]
AB  - Dopamine modulation of GABAergic transmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is
      thought to be critical for sustaining cognitive processes such as working memory 
      and decision-making. Here, we developed a neurocomputational model of the PFC
      that includes physiological features of the facilitatory action of dopamine on
      fast-spiking interneurons to assess how a GABAergic dysregulation impacts on the 
      prefrontal network stability and working memory. We found that a particular
      non-linear relationship between dopamine transmission and GABA function is
      required to enable input selectivity in the PFC for the formation and retention
      of working memory. Either degradation of the dopamine signal or the GABAergic
      function is sufficient to elicit hyperexcitability in pyramidal neurons and
      working memory impairments. The simulations also revealed an inverted U-shape
      relationship between working memory and dopamine, a function that is maintained
      even at high levels of GABA degradation. In fact, the working memory deficits
      resulting from reduced GABAergic transmission can be rescued by increasing
      dopamine tone and vice versa. We also examined the role of this dopamine-GABA
      interaction for the termination of working memory and found that the extent of
      GABAergic excitation needed to reset the PFC network begins to occur when the
      activity of fast-spiking interneurons surpasses 40 Hz. Together, these results
      indicate that the capability of the PFC to sustain working memory and network
      stability depends on a robust interplay of compensatory mechanisms between
      dopamine tone and the activity of local GABAergic interneurons.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Suicide is highly-prevalent and the most serious outcome in
      schizophrenia, yet the disturbances in neural system functions that confer
      suicide risk remain obscure. Circuits operated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are
      altered in psychotic disorders, and various PFC changes are observed in
      post-mortem studies of completed suicide. We tested whether PFC activity during
      goal-representation (an important component of cognitive control) relates to
      long-term suicide risk in recent-onset schizophrenia. METHOD: 35 patients with
      recent-onset of DSM-IV-TR-defined schizophrenia (SZ) were evaluated for long-term
      suicide risk (using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale) and functional
      MRI during cognitive control task performance. Group-level regression models
      associating control-related brain activation with suicide risk controlled for
      depression, psychosis and impulsivity. RESULTS: Within this group, past suicidal 
      ideation was associated with lower activation with goal-representation demands in
      multiple PFC sectors. Among those with past suicidal ideation (n=18), reported
      suicidal behavior was associated with lower control-related activation in
      premotor cortex ipsilateral to the active primary motor cortex. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study provides unique evidence that suicide risk directly relates to PFC-based
      circuit dysfunction during goal-representation, in a major mental illness with
      significant suicide rates. Among those with suicidal ideation, the overt
      expression in suicidal behavior may stem from impairments in premotor cortex
      support of action-planning as an expression of control. Further work should
      address how PFC-based control function changes with risk over time, whether this 
      brain-behavior relationship is specific to schizophrenia, and address its
      potential utility as a biomarker for interventions to mitigate suicide risk.

TI  - Cortical implication in lower voluntary muscle force production in non-hypoxemic 
      COPD patients.
PG  - e100961
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0100961 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have shown that muscle alterations cannot totally explain
      peripheral muscle weakness in COPD. Cerebral abnormalities in COPD are well
      documented but have never been implicated in muscle torque production. The
      purpose of this study was to assess the neural correlates of quadriceps torque
      control in COPD patients. Fifteen patients (FEV1 54.1+/-3.6% predicted) and 15
      age- and sex-matched healthy controls performed maximal (MVCs) and submaximal
      (SVCs) voluntary contractions at 10, 30 and 50% of the maximal voluntary torque
      of the knee extensors. Neural activity was quantified with changes in functional 
      near-infrared spectroscopy oxyhemoglobin (fNIRS-HbO) over the contralateral
      primary motor (M1), primary somatosensory (S1), premotor (PMC) and prefrontal
      (PFC) cortical areas. In parallel to the lower muscle torque, the COPD patients
      showed lower increase in HbO than healthy controls over the M1 (p<0.05), PMC
      (p<0.05) and PFC areas (p<0.01) during MVCs. In addition, they exhibited lower
      HbO changes over the M1 (p<0.01), S1 (p<0.05) and PMC (p<0.01) areas during SVCs 
      at 50% of maximal torque and altered motor control characterized by higher torque
      fluctuations around the target. The results show that low muscle force production
      is found in a context of reduced motor cortex activity, which is consistent with 
      central nervous system involvement in COPD muscle weakness.

TI  - Effectiveness of Gudair vaccine for the control of ovine Johne's disease in
      flocks vaccinating for at least 5 years.
PG  - 263-8
LID - 10.1111/avj.12194 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Examine the prevalence of shedding of Mycobacterium avium subsp.
      paratuberculosis (Mptb) at least 5 years after starting vaccination with Gudair
      in flocks of varying initial prevalence of ovine Johne's disease (OJD) and
      identify risk factors for variation in vaccine efficacy. METHODS: Pooled faecal
      culture (PFC) was conducted for 41 flocks from southern NSW and Victoria to
      determine estimates of current OJD prevalence. The data were compared to
      estimates of prevalence at or prior to commencement of vaccination at least 5
      years earlier, based on available serological or PFC tests when vaccination
      commenced. A cross-sectional study was conducted to identify risk factors for
      differing prevalence levels in 36 of the flocks. RESULTS: Historical data enabled
      classification of 37 flocks as high (13; 35.1%), medium (10; 27.0%) or low (14;
      37.8%) estimated initial OJD prevalence. Results of PFC in 2008-09 identified
      that 81.1% (30/37) of flocks had detectable shedders, with 48.6% (18/37) flocks
      still classified as medium or high OJD prevalence, including 50% (7/14) of flocks
      initially classified as low prevalence. Shedding was not detected in 18.9% (7/37)
      flocks. Flocks with OJD prevalence exceeding 1% at 5 years or more following the 
      commencement of vaccination were associated with reports of sheep straying and
      introduction of new sheep. CONCLUSION: Despite significant declines in estimated 
      OJD prevalence following vaccination for >/=5 years, 81.1% of flocks were
      shedding Mptb and considered at risk of spreading the disease or suffering
      recrudescence of losses if vaccination were to cease. Flock managers are advised 
      to persist with vaccination.

TI  - Core body temperature control by total liquid ventilation using a virtual lung
      temperature sensor.
PG  - 2859-68
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2014.2332293 [doi]
AB  - In total liquid ventilation (TLV), the lungs are filled with a breathable liquid 
      perfluorocarbon (PFC) while a liquid ventilator ensures proper gas exchange by
      renewal of a tidal volume of oxygenated and temperature-controlled PFC. Given the
      rapid changes in core body temperature generated by TLV using the lung has a heat
      exchanger, it is crucial to have accurate and reliable core body temperature
      monitoring and control. This study presents the design of a virtual lung
      temperature sensor to control core temperature. In the first step, the virtual
      sensor, using expired PFC to estimate lung temperature noninvasively, was
      validated both in vitro and in vivo. The virtual lung temperature was then used
      to rapidly and automatically control core temperature. Experimentations were
      performed using the Inolivent-5.0 liquid ventilator with a feedback controller to
      modulate inspired PFC temperature thereby controlling lung temperature. The in
      vivo experimental protocol was conducted on seven newborn lambs instrumented with
      temperature sensors at the femoral artery, pulmonary artery, oesophagus, right
      ear drum, and rectum. After stabilization in conventional mechanical ventilation,
      TLV was initiated with fast hypothermia induction, followed by slow
      posthypothermic rewarming for 1 h, then by fast rewarming to normothermia and
      finally a second fast hypothermia induction phase. Results showed that the
      virtual lung temperature was able to provide an accurate estimation of systemic
      arterial temperature. Results also demonstrate that TLV can precisely control
      core body temperature and can be favorably compared to extracorporeal circulation
      in terms of speed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently we showed that unilateral peripheral neuropathic lesions
      impacted differentially on rat's emotional/cognitive behavior depending on its
      left/right location; importantly, this observation recapitulates clinical
      reports. The prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region morphofunctionally affected 
      in chronic pain conditions, is involved in the modulation of both emotion and
      executive function and displays functional lateralization. To test whether the
      PFC is involved in the lateralization bias associated with left/right pain, c-fos
      expression in medial and orbital areas was analyzed in rats with an unilateral
      spared nerve injury neuropathy installed in the left or in the right side after
      performing an attentional set-shifting, a strongly PFC-dependent task. RESULTS:
      SNI-R animals required more trials to successfully terminate the reversal steps
      of the attentional set-shifting task. A generalized increase of c-fos density in 
      medial and orbital PFC (mPFC/OFC), irrespectively of the hemisphere, was observed
      in both SNI-L and SNI-R. However, individual laterality indexes revealed that
      contrary to controls and SNI-L, SNI-R animals presented a leftward shift in c-fos
      density in the ventral OFC (VO). None of these effects were observed in the
      neighboring primary motor area. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that chronic
      neuropathic pain is associated with a bilateral mPFC and OFC hyperactivation. We 
      hypothesize that the impaired performance of SNI-R animals is associated with a
      left/right activity inversion in the VO, whose functional integrity is critical
      for reversal learning.

AB  - Chronic scream sound alters the cognitive performance of male rats and their
      brain monoamine levels, these stress-induced alterations are sexually dimorphic. 
      To determine the effects of sound stress on female rats, we examined their serum 
      corticosterone levels and their adrenal, splenic, and thymic weights, their
      cognitive performance and the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters and their
      metabolites in the brain. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats, with and without
      exposure to scream sound (4h/day for 21 day) were tested for spatial learning and
      memory using a Morris water maze. Stress decreased serum corticosterone levels,
      as well as splenic and adrenal weight. It also impaired spatial memory but did
      not affect the learning ability. Monoamines and metabolites were measured in the 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. The dopamine
      (DA) levels in the PFC decreased but the homovanillic acid/DA ratio increased.
      The decreased DA and the increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels
      were observed in the striatum. Only the 5-HIAA level increased in the
      hypothalamus. In the hippocampus, stress did not affect the levels of monoamines 
      and metabolites. The results suggest that scream sound stress influences most
      physiologic parameters, memory, and the levels of monoamine neurotransmitter and 
      their metabolites in female rats.

AB  - PURPOSE: Prefrontal cortex (PFC) deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been proposed
      as a therapy for addiction and depression. This study investigates changes in rat
      cerebral glucose metabolism induced by different DBS frequencies using muPET.
      PROCEDURES: One hour DBS of the prelimbic area (PL) of the medial PFC (mPFC) (60 
      Hz, 130 Hz or sham) in rats (n = 9) was followed by 2-deoxy-2-[(18) F]
      fluoro-D-glucose ([(18) F]FDG) muPET. RESULTS: Sixty Hz DBS elicited significant 
      hypermetabolism in the ipsilateral PL ([(18) F]FDG uptake +5.2 +/- 2.3 %, p <
      0.05). At 130 Hz, hypometabolism was induced in the ipsilateral PL (-2.5 +/- 2.6 
      %, non-significant). Statistical parametric mapping revealed hypo and
      hypermetabolism clusters for both 60 and 130 Hz versus sham and show a certain
      state of alertness (increased activity in sensory and motor-related regions)
      mainly for 60 Hz. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the potential of 60 Hz PL mPFC
      DBS for the treatment of disorders associated with prefrontal hypofunction.

TI  - Persistent modification of forebrain networks and metabolism in rats following
      adolescent exposure to a 5-HT7 receptor agonist.
PG  - 75-89
LID - 10.1007/s00213-014-3639-6 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: The serotonin 7 receptor (5-HT7-R) is part of a neuro-transmission
      system with a proposed role in neural plasticity and in mood, cognitive or sleep 
      regulation. OBJECTIVES: We investigated long-term consequences of sub-chronic
      treatment, during adolescence (43-45 to 47-49 days old) in rats, with a novel
      5-HT7-R agonist (LP-211, 0 or 0.250 mg/kg/day). METHODS: We evaluated behavioural
      changes as well as forebrain structural/functional modifications by in vivo
      magnetic resonance (MR) in a 4.7 T system, followed by ex vivo histology.
      RESULTS: Adult rats pre-treated during adolescence showed reduced anxiety-related
      behaviour, in terms of reduced avoidance in the light/dark test and a less
      fragmented pattern of exploration in the novel object recognition test. Diffusion
      tensor imaging (DTI) revealed decreased mean diffusivity (MD) in the amygdala,
      increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the hippocampus (Hip) and reduced axial
      (D||) together with increased radial (D perpendicular) diffusivity in the nucleus
      accumbens (NAcc). An increased neural dendritic arborization was confirmed in the
      NAcc by ex vivo histology. Seed-based functional MR imaging (fMRI) identified
      increased strength of connectivity within and between "limbic" and "cortical"
      loops, with affected cross-correlations between amygdala, NAcc and Hip. The
      latter displayed enhanced connections through the dorsal striatum (dStr) to
      dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dl-PFC) and cerebellum. Functional connection
      also increased between amygdala and limbic elements such as NAcc, orbito-frontal 
      cortex (OFC) and hypothalamus. MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) indicated that adolescent
      LP-211 exposure increased glutamate and total creatine in the adult Hip.
      CONCLUSIONS: Persistent MR-detectable modifications indicate a rearrangement
      within forebrain networks, accounting for long-lasting behavioural changes as a
      function of developmental 5-HT7-R stimulation.

TI  - Prevention of alcohol-heightened aggression by CRF-R1 antagonists in mice:
      critical role for DRN-PFC serotonin pathway.
PG  - 2874-83
LID - 10.1038/npp.2014.139 [doi]
AB  - Alcohol can escalate aggressive behavior in a significant subgroup of rodents,
      humans, and nonhuman primates. The present study investigated whether blockade of
      corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 1 (CRF-R1) could prevent the
      emergence of alcohol-heightened aggression in mice. The serotonin (5-HT) pathway 
      from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) by
      CRF-R1 was investigated as a possible target for the prevention of
      alcohol-heightened aggressive behavior. Male CFW mice that reliably exhibited
      aggressive behaviors after consuming 1 g/kg of alcohol received systemic or
      intra-DRN administration of CRF-R1 antagonists, CP-154,526 or MTIP, before a
      confrontation with a male conspecific. Blockade of DRN CRF-R1 receptors with both
      antagonists significantly reduced only alcohol-heightened aggression, whereas
      systemic administration reduced both alcohol-heightened and species-typical
      aggression. Next, a 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, was coadministered with CP-154,526
      into the DRN to temporarily disrupt 5-HT activity. This manipulation abolished
      the antiaggressive effects of intra-DRN CP-154,526. In the mPFC, in vivo
      microdialysis revealed that extracellular 5-HT levels were increased in mice that
      consumed alcohol and were then injected with CP-154,526, both systemically or
      intra-DRN. Neither alcohol nor CP-154,526 alone affected 5-HT release in the
      mPFC. The present results suggest the DRN as a critical site for CRF-R1 to
      modulate alcohol-heightened aggression via action on the serotonergic DRN-PFC
      pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Comprehensive annotation of transcripts expressed in a given tissue
      is a critical step towards the understanding of regulatory and functional
      pathways that shape the transcriptome. RESULTS: Here, we reconstructed a
      cumulative transcriptome of the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) based on
      approximately 300 million strand-specific RNA sequence (RNA-seq) reads collected 
      at different stages of postnatal development. We find that more than 50% of
      reconstructed transcripts represent novel transcriptome elements, including 8,343
      novel exons and exon extensions of annotated coding genes, 11,217 novel antisense
      transcripts and 29,541 novel intergenic transcripts or their fragments showing
      canonical features of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Our analysis further led to
      a surprising discovery of a novel class of bidirectional promoters (NBiPs)
      driving divergent transcription of mRNA and novel lncRNA pairs and displaying a
      distinct set of sequence and epigenetic features. In contrast to known
      bidirectional and unidirectional promoters, NBiPs are strongly associated with
      genes involved in neuronal functions and regulated by neuron-associated
      transcription factors. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results demonstrate that 
      large portions of the human transcriptome remain uncharacterized. The distinct
      sequence and epigenetic features of NBiPs, as well as their specific association 
      with neuronal genes, further suggest existence of regulatory pathways specific to
      the human brain.

AB  - The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to regulate higher order processes
      like cognitive flexibility. Accumulating behavioral evidence suggests that
      endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling regulates neuronal architecture within the PFC,
      as well as certain forms of cognitive flexibility; however, all of these studies 
      have been performed in male rodents and it is currently unknown whether the eCB
      system performs a similar role in females. To this extent, dendritic morphology
      of layer II/III neurons in the infra- and prelimbic regions of the mPFC was
      analyzed and cognitive ability and flexibility in a fixed-platform Morris water
      maze task was assessed in adult female CB1 receptor knockout (CB1KO) mice.
      Similar to data generated in male mice, female mice exhibited no difference in
      acquisition relative to wildtype (WT); however, during reversal learning, CB1KO
      females spent more time in the original training quadrant and took significantly 
      longer to learn the location of the new platform relative to WT. Within the mPFC,
      female mice had reduced length and complexity of layer II/III neurons within the 
      prelimbic, but not infralimbic region of the PFC. Taken together, these findings 
      indicate that the role of eCB signaling in cognitive flexibility is independent
      of sex and disrupted CB1 receptor signaling results in compromised structure and 
      function of the PFC, at least within the prelimbic division.

TI  - Perfluoroalkyl chemicals and asthma among children 12-19 years of age: NHANES
      (1999-2008).
PG  - 1129-33
LID - 10.1289/ehp.1306606 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs) are a family of commonly used
      industrial chemicals whose persistence and ubiquity in human blood samples has
      led to concern about possible toxicity. Several animal studies and one recent
      human study have suggested a link between exposure to PFCs and asthma, although
      few epidemiologic studies have been conducted. OBJECTIVES: We investigated
      children's PFC serum concentrations and their associations with asthma-related
      outcomes. METHODS: We evaluated the association between serum concentrations of
      eight PFCs, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic
      acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid
      (PFHxS), with self-reported lifetime asthma, recent wheezing, and current asthma 
      using data from participants 12-19 years of age from the 1999-2000 and 2003-2008 
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. RESULTS: In
      multivariable-adjusted models, PFOA was associated with higher odds of ever
      having received a diagnosis of asthma [odds ratio (OR) = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.39
      for a doubling in PFOA], whereas for PFOS there were inverse relationships with
      both asthma and wheezing (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.04, and OR = 0.83; 95% CI:
      0.67, 1.02, respectively). The associations were attenuated after accounting for 
      sampling weights. No associations were seen between the other PFCs and any
      outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study provides some evidence for
      associations between exposure to PFCs and asthma-related outcomes in children.
      The evidence is inconsistent, however, and prospective studies are needed.

TI  - Pre-task prefrontal activation during cognitive processes in aging: a
      near-infrared spectroscopy study.
PG  - e98779
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0098779 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cognitive processing generally deteriorates as people age. Recent
      neuroimaging studies have shown that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in
      human-specific behavior, such as preparing for future actions and prospective
      memory; hence, the PFC may be voluntarily activated even during the "resting"
      condition that precedes task execution. The purpose of the present study was to
      investigate changes in voluntary pre-task activation as a result of aging using a
      paradigm that includes a longer intertrial interval (e.g., 30 sec) than has been 
      used in previous studies. METHODS: A total of 120 cognitively normal adults
      (young: 60, old: 60) participated in this near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
      study. All subjects performed 6 repetitions of the working memory task, which
      included a 30 sec resting period and a 28.8 sec task period. The resting period
      was divided into baseline and pre-task (preT) periods, and the task period was
      divided into early easy task (eT) and late difficult task (dT) periods. We then
      normalized the data, analyzed the magnitude of task-related NIRS responses in
      each period and compared the results between groups using an analysis of variance
      test. RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed a significant interaction between
      group x optode location x period, in which hemodynamic responses in the PFC
      during the preT period were smaller in the elderly in than young adults. By
      contrast, during the task period, the hemodynamic responses were higher in the
      lateral PFC in the elderly than in young adults. Spearman's rank correlation
      analysis showed a positive correlation between hemodynamic changes during the
      preT period in the PFC and correct answer ratios in both groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      These findings suggest that more pre-task activation in the anterior PFC is
      related to better cognitive performance in humans. Thus, a reduction in this
      activation might partly explain cognitive decline in the elderly.

TI  - Psychosocial functioning is correlated with activation in the anterior cingulate 
      cortex and left lateral prefrontal cortex during a verbal fluency task in
      euthymic bipolar disorder: a preliminary fMRI study.
PG  - 188-96
AB  - AIM: Cognitive impairment may account for functional and occupational disability 
      in patients with bipolar disorder even during periods of euthymia. While imaging 
      suggests structural, neurochemical, and functional abnormalities in bipolar
      disorder patients, the pathophysiology of these deficits has not been elucidated.
      It was hypothesized that euthymic bipolar patients would have different cortical 
      activation during a verbal fluency task compared to healthy controls, and that
      psychosocial functioning would be associated with prefrontal cortical activation 
      during the task in the bipolar group. METHODS: Ten euthymic bipolar patients and 
      10 healthy control participants (matched for age, gender, and years of education)
      underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a verbal fluency
      task, tapping task and visual task. Correlational analysis between the fMRI brain
      activation and clinical variables of the participants, including Global
      Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score, was performed. RESULTS: Compared to the
      controls, euthymic bipolar patients had significantly greater activation in the
      bilateral precuneus with similar behavioral performance during the verbal fluency
      task. There were no significant differences between the groups for the visual
      task or the simple motor task. Activation in both the left anterior cingulate
      cortex (ACC) and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) were significantly
      positively correlated with GAF score in the euthymic bipolar patients.
      CONCLUSION: Both the ACC and lateral PFC regions are components of a neural
      network that plays a critical role in psychosocial functioning, and are often
      found to be affected in bipolar patients.

AB  - Antipsychotic drugs (APDs) are the standard treatment for schizophrenia. The
      therapeutic effect of these drugs is dependent upon the dopaminergic D2 blockade,
      but they also modulate other neurotransmitter pathways. The exact mechanisms
      underlying the clinical response to APDs are not fully understood. In this study,
      we compared three groups of animals for the expression of 84 neurotransmitter
      genes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Each group was
      treated with a different APD (risperidone, clozapine or haloperidol), and with a 
      non-treated group of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), which is an animal
      model for schizophrenia. This study also explored whether or not differential
      expression was regulated by DNA methylation in the promoter region (PR). In the
      clozapine group, we found that Chrng was downregulated in the NAcc and six genes 
      were downregulated in the PFC. In the haloperidol group, Brs3 and Glra1 were
      downregulated, as was Drd2 in the clozapine group and Drd3, Galr3 and Gabrr1 in
      the clozapine and haloperidol groups. We also encountered four hypermethylated CG
      sites in the Glra1 PR, as well as three in the risperidone group and another in
      the haloperidol group, when compared to non-treated rats. Following the APD
      treatment, the gene expression results revealed the involvement of genes that had
      not previously been described, in addition to the activity of established genes. 
      The investigation of the involvement of these novel genes can lead to better
      understanding about the specific mechanisms of action of the individual APDs
      studied.

TI  - Sustained anxiety increases amygdala-dorsomedial prefrontal coupling: a mechanism
      for maintaining an anxious state in healthy adults.
PG  - 321-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging research has traditionally explored fear and anxiety in 
      response to discrete threat cues (e.g., during fear conditioning). However,
      anxiety is a sustained aversive state that can persist in the absence of discrete
      threats. Little is known about mechanisms that maintain anxiety states over a
      prolonged period. Here, we used a robust translational paradigm (threat of shock)
      to induce sustained anxiety. Recent translational work has implicated an
      amygdala-prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuit in the maintenance of anxiety in
      rodents. To explore the functional homologues of this circuitry in humans, we
      used a novel paradigm to examine the impact of sustained anticipatory anxiety on 
      amygdala-PFC intrinsic connectivity. METHODS: Task-independent fMRI data were
      collected in healthy participants during long-duration periods of shock
      anticipation and safety. We examined intrinsic functional connectivity. RESULTS: 
      Our study involved 20 healthy participants. During sustained anxiety, amygdala
      activity was positively coupled with dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) activity. High trait
      anxiety was associated with increased amygdala-DMPFC coupling. In addition,
      induced anxiety was associated with positive coupling between regions involved in
      defensive responding, and decreased coupling between regions involved in
      emotional control and the default mode network. LIMITATIONS: Inferences regarding
      anxious pathology should be made with caution because this study was conducted in
      healthy participants. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that anticipatory anxiety
      increases intrinsic amygdala-DMPFC coupling and that the DMPFC may serve as a
      functional homologue for the rodent prefrontal regions by sustaining anxiety.
      Future research may use this defensive neural context to identify biomarkers of
      risk for anxious pathology and target these circuits for therapeutic
      intervention.

TI  - Transcriptomic evidence for immaturity of the prefrontal cortex in patients with 
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 41
LID - 10.1186/1756-6606-7-41 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia, a severe psychiatric disorder, has a lifetime
      prevalence of 1%. The exact mechanisms underlying this disorder remain unknown,
      though theories abound. Recent studies suggest that particular cell types and
      biological processes in the schizophrenic cortex have a pseudo-immature status in
      which the molecular properties partially resemble those in the normal immature
      brain. However, genome-wide gene expression patterns in the brains of patients
      with schizophrenia and those of normal infants have not been directly compared.
      Here, we show that the gene expression patterns in the schizophrenic prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) resemble those in the juvenile PFC. RESULTS: We conducted a gene
      expression meta-analysis in which, using microarray data derived from different
      studies, altered expression patterns in the dorsolateral PFC (DLFC) of patients
      with schizophrenia were compared with those in the DLFC of developing normal
      human brains, revealing a striking similarity. The results were replicated in a
      second DLFC data set and a medial PFC (MFC) data set. We also found that about
      half of the genes representing the transcriptomic immaturity of the schizophrenic
      PFC were developmentally regulated in fast-spiking interneurons, astrocytes, and 
      oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, to test whether medications, which often confound 
      the results of postmortem analyses, affect on the juvenile-like gene expressions 
      in the schizophrenic PFC, we compared the gene expression patterns showing
      transcriptomic immaturity in the schizophrenic PFC with those in the PFC of
      rodents treated with antipsychotic drugs. The results showed no apparent
      similarities between the two conditions, suggesting that the juvenile-like gene
      expression patterns observed in the schizophrenic PFC could not be accounted for 
      by medication effects. Moreover, the developing human PFC showed a gene
      expression pattern similar to that of the PFC of naive Schnurri-2 knockout mice, 
      an animal model of schizophrenia with good face and construct validity. This
      result also supports the idea that the transcriptomic immaturity of the
      schizophrenic PFC is not due to medication effects. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively,
      our results provide evidence that pseudo-immaturity of the PFC resembling
      juvenile PFC may be an endophenotype of schizophrenia.

TI  - Prefrontal cortical and striatal transcriptional responses to the reinforcing
      effect of repeated methylphenidate treatment in the spontaneously hypertensive
      rat, animal model of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/1744-9081-10-17 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methylphenidate is the most commonly used stimulant drug for the
      treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Research has found 
      that methylphenidate is a "reinforcer" and that individuals with ADHD also abuse 
      this medication. Nevertheless, the molecular consequences of long-term
      recreational methylphenidate use or abuse in individuals with ADHD are not yet
      fully known. METHODS: Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the most validated
      and widely used ADHD animal model, were pretreated with methylphenidate (5 mg/kg,
      i.p.) during their adolescence (post-natal day [PND] 42-48) and tested for
      subsequent methylphenidate-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) and
      self-administration. Thereafter, the differentially expressed genes in the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum of representative methylphenidate-treated
      SHRs, which showed CPP to and self-administration of methylphenidate, were
      analyzed. RESULTS: Genome-wide transcriptome profiling analyses revealed 30
      differentially expressed genes in the PFC, which include transcripts involved in 
      apoptosis (e.g. S100a9, Angptl4, Nfkbia), transcription (Cebpb, Per3), and
      neuronal plasticity (Homer1, Jam2, Asap1). In contrast, 306 genes were
      differentially expressed in the striatum and among them, 252 were downregulated. 
      The main functional categories overrepresented among the downregulated genes
      include those involved in cell adhesion (e.g. Pcdh10, Ctbbd1, Itgb6), positive
      regulation of apoptosis (Perp, Taf1, Api5), (Notch3, Nsbp1, Sik1), mitochondrion 
      organization (Prps18c, Letm1, Uqcrc2), and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Nedd4,
      Usp27x, Ube2d2). CONCLUSION: Together, these changes indicate
      methylphenidate-induced neurotoxicity, altered synaptic and neuronal plasticity, 
      energy metabolism and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in the brains of
      methylphenidate-treated SHRs, which showed methylphenidate CPP and
      self-administration. In addition, these findings may also reflect cognitive
      impairment associated with chronic methylphenidate use as demonstrated in
      preclinical studies. Future studies are warranted to determine the clinical
      significance of the present findings with regard to long-term recreational
      methylphenidate use or abuse in individuals with ADHD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety produced by environmental threats can impair goal-directed
      processing and is associated with a range of psychiatric disorders, particularly 
      when aversive events occur unpredictably. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought 
      to implement controls that minimize performance disruptions from threat-induced
      anxiety and goal distraction by modulating activity in regions involved in threat
      detection, such as the amygdala. The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), orbitofrontal 
      cortex (OFC), and ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) have been linked to the regulation of 
      anxiety during threat exposure. We developed a paradigm to determine if
      threat-induced anxiety would enhance functional connectivity between the amygdala
      and IFG, OFC, and vmPFC. METHODS: Healthy adults performed a computer-gaming
      style task involving capturing prey and evading predators to optimize monetary
      rewards while exposed to the threat of unpredictable shock. Psychophysiological
      recording (n = 26) and functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning (n = 17)
      were collected during the task in separate cohorts. Task-specific changes in
      functional connectivity with the amygdala were examined using psychophysiological
      interaction analysis. RESULTS: Threat exposure resulted in greater arousal
      measured by increased skin conductance but did not influence performance (i.e.,
      monetary losses or rewards). Greater functional connectivity between the right
      amygdala and bilateral IFG, OFC, vmPFC, anterior cingulate cortex, and
      frontopolar cortex was associated with threat exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to 
      unpredictable threat modulates amygdala-PFC functional connectivity that may help
      maintain performance when experiencing anxiety induced by threat. Our paradigm is
      well-suited to explore the neural underpinnings of the anxiety response to
      unpredictable threat in patients with various anxiety disorders.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare moment-to-moment appraisals and coping
      strategies of 4 non-elite and 2 elite male trap shooters during competitions and 
      in particular during periods of competition perceived as critical to performance.
      Appraisals and coping patterns of trap shooters were captured via verbal reports 
      of thinking provided between sets of shots during major competitions. Verbal
      reports were coded according to an appraisal and coping typology. Coded data as
      well as shooting performance data were subjected to a sequential analysis of
      probabilities of pairs of events. Fewer reports of negative appraisals (NEGAs)
      and more frequent reports of problem-focused coping (PFC) were observed among
      both elite athletes compared to non-elite athletes. After making a NEGA,
      non-elite shooters often progressed to the next target without attempting to
      cope, whereas elite shooters used both PFC and emotion-focused coping (EFC)
      before proceeding to the next target. After missing a target, the non-elite
      athletes used more EFC than expected. These results indicate that elite athletes 
      are more likely to cope with NEGAs than non-elite athletes using a wider variety 
      of coping strategies. Athletes might benefit from increased awareness of the
      potentially detrimental impact of NEGAs on performance and by integrating coping 
      strategies within preparatory routines.

TI  - Studying hemispheric lateralization during a Stroop task through near-infrared
      spectroscopy-based connectivity.

AB  - ABSTRACT. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a developing and promising
      functional brain imaging technology. Developing data analysis methods to
      effectively extract meaningful information from collected data is the major
      bottleneck in popularizing this technology. In this study, we measured
      hemodynamic activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during a color-word matching 
      Stroop task using NIRS. Hemispheric lateralization was examined by employing
      traditional activation and novel NIRS-based connectivity analyses simultaneously.
      Wavelet transform coherence was used to assess intrahemispheric functional
      connectivity. Spearman correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship 
      between behavioral performance and activation/functional connectivity,
      respectively. In agreement with activation analysis, functional connectivity
      analysis revealed leftward lateralization for the Stroop effect and correlation
      with behavioral performance. However, functional connectivity was more sensitive 
      than activation for identifying hemispheric lateralization. Granger causality was
      used to evaluate the effective connectivity between hemispheres. The results
      showed increased information flow from the left to the right hemispheres for the 
      incongruent versus the neutral task, indicating a leading role of the left PFC.
      This study demonstrates that the NIRS-based connectivity can reveal the
      functional architecture of the brain more comprehensively than traditional
      activation, helping to better utilize the advantages of NIRS.

TI  - Prepuberal intranasal dopamine treatment in an animal model of ADHD ameliorates
      deficient spatial attention, working memory, amino acid transmitters and synaptic
      markers in prefrontal cortex, ventral and dorsal striatum.
PG  - 2105-22

AB  - Intranasal application of dopamine (IN-DA) has been shown to increase motor
      activity and to release DA in the ventral (VS) and dorsal striatum (DS) of rats. 
      The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of IN-DA treatment on
      parameters of DA and excitatory amino acid (EAA) function in prepuberal rats of
      the Naples high-excitability (NHE) line, an animal model for attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and normal random bred (NRB) controls. NHE and NRB 
      rats were daily administered IN-DA (0.075, 0.15, 0.30 mg/kg) or vehicle for 15
      days from postnatal days 28-42 and subsequently tested in the Lat maze and in the
      Eight-arm radial Olton maze. Soluble and membrane-trapped L-glutamate (L-Glu) and
      L-aspartate (L-Asp) levels as well as NMDAR1 subunit protein levels were
      determined after sacrifice in IN-DA- and vehicle-treated NHE and NRB rats in
      prefrontal cortex (PFc), DS and VS. Moreover, DA transporter (DAT) protein and
      tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels were assessed in PFc, DS, VS and mesencephalon
      (MES) and in ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra, respectively. In 
      NHE rats, IN-DA (0.30 mg/kg) decreased horizontal activity and increased
      nonselective attention relative to vehicle, whereas the lower dose (0.15 mg/kg)
      increased selective spatial attention. In NHE rats, basal levels of soluble EAAs 
      were reduced in PFc and DS relative to NRB controls, while membrane-trapped EAAs 
      were elevated in VS. Moreover, basal NMDAR1 subunit protein levels were increased
      in PFc, DS and VS relative to NRB controls. In addition, DAT protein levels were 
      elevated in PFc and VS relative to NRB controls. IN-DA led to a number of changes
      of EAA, NMDAR1 subunit protein, TH and DAT protein levels in PFc, DS, VS, MES and
      VTA, in both NHE and NRB rats with significant differences between lines. Our
      findings indicate that the NHE rat model of ADHD may be characterized by (1)
      prefrontal and striatal DAT hyperfunction, indicative of DA hyperactivty, and (2)
      prefrontal and striatal NMDA receptor hyperfunction indicative of net EAA
      hyperactivty. IN-DA had ameliorative effects on activity level, attention, and
      working memory, which are likely to be associated with DA action at inhibitory D2
      autoreceptors, leading to a reduction in striatal DA hyperactivity and, possibly,
      DA action on striatal EAA levels, resulting in a decrease of striatal EAA
      hyperfunction (with persistence of prefrontal EAA hyperfunction). Previous
      studies on IN-DA treatment in rodents have indicated antidepressant, anxiolytic
      and anti-parkinsonian effects in relation to enhanced central DAergic activity.
      Our present results strengthen the prospects of potential therapeutic
      applications of intranasal DA by indicating an enhancement of selective attention
      and working memory in a deficit model.
