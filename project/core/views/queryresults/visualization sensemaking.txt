TI  - How do People Make Sense of Unfamiliar Visualizations?: A Grounded Model of
      Novice's Information Visualization Sensemaking.
PG  - 499-508
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467195 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we would like to investigate how people make sense of unfamiliar
      information visualizations. In order to achieve the research goal, we conducted a
      qualitative study by observing 13 participants when they endeavored to make sense
      of three unfamiliar visualizations (i.e., a parallel-coordinates plot, a chord
      diagram, and a treemap) that they encountered for the first time. We collected
      data including audio/video record of think-aloud sessions and semi-structured
      interview; and analyzed the data using the grounded theory method. The primary
      result of this study is a grounded model of NOvice's information Vlsualization
      Sensemaking (NOVIS model), which consists of the five major cognitive activities:
      encountering visualization, constructing a frame, exploring visualization,
      questioning the frame, and floundering on visualization. We introduce the NOVIS
      model by explaining the five activities with representative quotes from our
      participants. We also explore the dynamics in the model. Lastly, we compare with 
      other existing models and share further research directions that arose from our
      observations.

TI  - Interactive exploration of implicit and explicit relations in faceted datasets.
PG  - 2080-9
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2013.167 [doi]
AB  - Many datasets, such as scientific literature collections, contain multiple
      heterogeneous facets which derive implicit relations, as well as explicit
      relational references between data items. The exploration of this data is
      challenging not only because of large data scales but also the complexity of
      resource structures and semantics. In this paper, we present PivotSlice, an
      interactive visualization technique which provides efficient faceted browsing as 
      well as flexible capabilities to discover data relationships. With the metaphor
      of direct manipulation, PivotSlice allows the user to visually and logically
      construct a series of dynamic queries over the data, based on a multi-focus and
      multi-scale tabular view that subdivides the entire dataset into several
      meaningful parts with customized semantics. PivotSlice further facilitates the
      visual exploration and sensemaking process through features including live search
      and integration of online data, graphical interaction histories and smoothly
      animated visual state transitions. We evaluated PivotSlice through a qualitative 
      lab study with university researchers and report the findings from our
      observations and interviews. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of PivotSlice 
      using a scenario of exploring a repository of information visualization
      literature.

TI  - Making sense of personal health information: challenges for information
      visualization.
PG  - 198-217
LID - 10.1177/1460458212465213 [doi]
AB  - This article presents a systematic review of the literature on information
      visualization for making sense of personal health information. Based on this
      review, five application themes were identified: treatment planning, examination 
      of patients' medical records, representation of pedigrees and family history,
      communication and shared decision making, and life management and health
      monitoring. While there are recognized design challenges associated with each of 
      these themes, such as how best to represent data visually and integrate
      qualitative and quantitative information, other challenges and opportunities have
      received little attention to date. In this article, we highlight, in particular, 
      the opportunities for supporting people in better understanding their own
      illnesses and making sense of their health conditions in order to manage them
      more effectively.

TI  - Combining computational analyses and interactive visualization for document
      exploration and sensemaking in jigsaw.
PG  - 1646-63
AB  - Investigators across many disciplines and organizations must sift through large
      collections of text documents to understand and piece together information.
      Whether they are fighting crime, curing diseases, deciding what car to buy, or
      researching a new field, inevitably investigators will encounter text documents. 
      Taking a visual analytics approach, we integrate multiple text analysis
      algorithms with a suite of interactive visualizations to provide a flexible and
      powerful environment that allows analysts to explore collections of documents
      while sensemaking. Our particular focus is on the process of integrating
      automated analyses with interactive visualizations in a smooth and fluid manner. 
      We illustrate this integration through two example scenarios: an academic
      researcher examining InfoVis and VAST conference papers and a consumer exploring 
      car reviews while pondering a purchase decision. Finally, we provide lessons
      learned toward the design and implementation of visual analytics systems for
      document exploration and understanding.

TI  - The User Puzzle&#8212;Explaining the Interaction with Visual Analytics Systems.
PG  - 2908-16
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2012.273 [doi]
AB  - Visual analytics emphasizes the interplay between visualization, analytical
      procedures performed by computers and human perceptual and cognitive activities. 
      Human reasoning is an important element in this context. There are several
      theories in psychology and HCI explaining open-ended and exploratory reasoning.
      Five of these theories (sensemaking theories, gestalt theories, distributed
      cognition, graph comprehension theories and skill-rule-knowledge models) are
      described in this paper. We discuss their relevance for visual analytics. In
      order to do this more systematically, we developed a schema of categories
      relevant for visual analytics research and evaluation. All these theories have
      strengths but also weaknesses in explaining interaction with visual analytics
      systems. A possibility to overcome the weaknesses would be to combine two or more
      of these theories.

TI  - Semantic Interaction for Sensemaking: Inferring Analytical Reasoning for Model
      Steering.
PG  - 2879-88
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2012.260 [doi]
AB  - Visual analytic tools aim to support the cognitively demanding task of
      sensemaking. Their success often depends on the ability to leverage capabilities 
      of mathematical models, visualization, and human intuition through flexible,
      usable, and expressive interactions. Spatially clustering data is one effective
      metaphor for users to explore similarity and relationships between information,
      adjusting the weighting of dimensions or characteristics of the dataset to
      observe the change in the spatial layout. Semantic interaction is an approach to 
      user interaction in such spatializations that couples these parametric
      modifications of the clustering model with users' analytic operations on the data
      (e.g., direct document movement in the spatialization, highlighting text, search,
      etc.). In this paper, we present results of a user study exploring the ability of
      semantic interaction in a visual analytic prototype, ForceSPIRE, to support
      sensemaking. We found that semantic interaction captures the analytical reasoning
      of the user through keyword weighting, and aids the user in co-creating a
      spatialization based on the user's reasoning and intuition.

TI  - AdaptiviTree: adaptive tree visualization for tournament-style brackets.
PG  - 1113-20
AB  - Online pick'em games, such as the recent NCAA college basketball March Madness
      tournament, form a large and rapidly growing industry. In these games, players
      make predictions on a tournament bracket that defines which competitors play each
      other and how they proceed toward a single champion. Throughout the course of the
      tournament, players monitor the brackets to track progress and to compare
      predictions made by multiple players. This is often a complex sensemaking task.
      The classic bracket visualization was designed for use on paper and utilizes an
      incrementally additive system in which the winner of each match-up is rewritten
      in the next round as the tournament progresses. Unfortunately, this
      representation requires a significant amount of space and makes it relatively
      difficult to get a quick overview of the tournament state since competitors take 
      arbitrary paths through the static bracket. In this paper, we present
      AdaptiviTree, a novel visualization that adaptively deforms the representation of
      the tree and uses its shape to convey outcome information. AdaptiviTree not only 
      provides a more compact and understandable representation, but also allows
      overlays that display predictions as well as other statistics. We describe
      results from a lab study we conducted to explore the efficacy of AdaptiviTree, as
      well as from a deployment of the system in a recent real-world sports tournament.
